History of Lithuania,"The history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago,[1][2] but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD.[3] Lithuanians, one of the Baltic peoples, later conquered neighboring lands and established the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century (and also a short-lived Kingdom of Lithuania). The Grand Duchy was a successful and lasting warrior state. It remained fiercely independent and was one of the last areas of Europe to adopt Christianity (beginning in the 14th century). A formidable power, it became the largest state in Europe in the 15th century spread from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, through the conquest of large groups of East Slavs who resided in Ruthenia.[4]

In 1385, the Grand Duchy formed a dynastic union with Poland through the Union of Krewo. Later, the Union of Lublin (1569) created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. During the Second Northern War, the Grand Duchy sought protection under the Swedish Empire through the Union of Kėdainiai in 1655. However, it soon returned to being a part of the Polish–Lithuanian state, which persisted until 1795 when the last of the Partitions of Poland erased both independent Lithuania and Poland from the political map. After the dissolution, Lithuanians lived under the rule of the Russian Empire until the 20th century, although there were several major rebellions, especially in 1830–1831 and 1863.

On 16 February 1918, Lithuania was re-established as a democratic state. It remained independent until the onset of World War II, when it was occupied by the Soviet Union under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Following a brief occupation by Nazi Germany after the Nazis waged war on the Soviet Union, Lithuania was again absorbed into the Soviet Union for nearly 50 years. In 1990–1991, Lithuania restored its sovereignty with the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania. Lithuania joined the NATO alliance in 2004 and the European Union as part of its enlargement in 2004.

The first humans arrived on the territory of modern Lithuania in the second half of the 10th millennium BC after the glaciers receded at the end of the last glacial period.[2] They were traveling hunters and did not form stable settlements. According to the historian Marija Gimbutas, these people came from two directions: the Jutland Peninsula and from present-day Poland. They brought two different cultures, as evidenced by the tools they used.[citation needed] The following centuries are characterised by the ""Baltic Magdalenian"" and the Swiderian culture.[5] In the 8th millennium BC, the climate became much warmer, and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania then traveled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and fresh-water fishing. This transition is often connected with the cultural transition from Paleolithic to Mesolithic.[6] During the 5th millennium BC, the Neolithic started and different forms of crafts and artistic production started to develop. Hunting, however, stayed the main form of food procurement; agriculture developed only slowly and did not emerge until the 3rd millennium BC.[7] During the Neolithic, first forms of interregional trade began, especially with amber.[8] The dwellings became more sophisticated in order to shelter larger families.

Speakers of North-Western Indo-European might have arrived with the Corded Ware culture around 3200/3100 BC.[9]

The first Lithuanian people were a branch of an ancient group known as the Balts.[a] The main tribal divisions of the Balts were the West Baltic Old Prussians and Yotvingians, and the East Baltic Lithuanians and Latvians. The Balts spoke forms of the Indo-European languages.[11] Today, the only remaining Baltic nationalities are the Lithuanians and Latvians, but there were more Baltic groups or tribes in the past. Some of these merged into Lithuanians and Latvians (Samogitians, Selonians, Curonians, Semigallians), while others no longer existed after they were conquered and assimilated by the State of the Teutonic Order (Old Prussians, Yotvingians, Sambians, Skalvians, and Galindians).[12]

The Baltic tribes did not maintain close cultural or political contacts with the Roman Empire, but they did maintain trade contacts (see Amber Road). Tacitus, in his study Germania, described the Aesti people, inhabitants of the south-eastern Baltic Sea shores who were probably Balts, around the year 97 AD.[13] The Western Balts differentiated and became known to outside chroniclers first. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD knew of the Galindians and Yotvingians, and early medieval chroniclers mentioned Prussians, Curonians and Semigallians.[14]

Lithuania, located along the lower and middle Neman River basin, comprised mainly the culturally different regions of Samogitia (known for its early medieval skeletal burials), and further east Aukštaitija, or Lithuania proper (known for its early medieval cremation burials).[15] The area was remote and unattractive to outsiders, including traders, which accounts for its separate linguistic, cultural and religious identity and delayed integration into general European patterns and trends.[11]

The Lithuanian language is considered to be very conservative for its close connection to Indo-European roots. It is believed to have differentiated from the Latvian language, the most closely related existing language, around the 7th century.[16] Traditional Lithuanian pagan customs and mythology, with many archaic elements, were long preserved. Rulers' bodies were cremated up until the Christianization of Lithuania: the descriptions of the cremation ceremonies of the grand dukes Algirdas and Kęstutis have survived.[17]

The Lithuanian tribe is thought to have developed more recognizably toward the end of the first millennium.[14] The first known reference to Lithuania as a nation (""Litua"") comes from the Annals of the Quedlinburg monastery, dated 9 March 1009.[18] In 1009, the missionary Bruno of Querfurt arrived in Lithuania and baptized the Lithuanian ruler ""King Nethimer.""[19]

From the 9th to the 11th centuries, coastal Balts were subjected to raids by the Vikings, and the kings of Denmark collected tribute at times. During the 10–11th centuries, Lithuanian territories were among the lands paying tribute to Kievan Rus', and Yaroslav the Wise was among the Ruthenian rulers who invaded Lithuania (from 1040). From the mid-12th century, it was the Lithuanians who were invading Ruthenian territories. In 1183, Polotsk and Pskov were ravaged, and even the distant and powerful Novgorod Republic was repeatedly threatened by the excursions from the emerging Lithuanian war machine toward the end of the 12th century.[20]

In the 12th century and afterwards, mutual raids involving Lithuanian and Polish forces took place sporadically, but the two countries were separated by the lands of the Yotvingians. The late 12th century brought an eastern expansion of German settlers (the Ostsiedlung) to the mouth of the Daugava River area. Military confrontations with Lithuanians followed at that time and at the turn of the century, but for the time being the Lithuanians had the upper hand.[21]

From the late 12th century, an organized Lithuanian military force existed; it was used for external raids, plundering and the gathering of slaves. Such military and pecuniary activities fostered social differentiation and triggered a struggle for power in Lithuania. This initiated the formation of early statehood, from which the Grand Duchy of Lithuania developed.[11] In 1231, the Danish Census Book mentions Baltic lands paying tribute to the Danes, including Lithuania (Littonia).[22]

From the early 13th century, frequent foreign military excursions became possible due to the increased cooperation and coordination among the Baltic tribes.[11] Forty such expeditions took place between 1201 and 1236 against Ruthenia, Poland, Latvia and Estonia, which were then being conquered by the Livonian Order. Pskov was pillaged and burned in 1213.[21] In 1219, twenty-one Lithuanian chiefs signed a peace treaty with the state of Galicia–Volhynia. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating.[23]

From the early 13th century, two German crusading military orders, the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Teutonic Knights, became established at the mouth of the Daugava River and in Chełmno Land respectively. Under the pretense of converting the population to Christianity, they proceeded to conquer much of the area that is now Latvia and Estonia, in addition to parts of Lithuania.[11] In response, a number of small Baltic tribal groups united under the rule of Mindaugas. Mindaugas, originally a kunigas or major chief, one of the five senior dukes listed in the treaty of 1219, is referred to as the ruler of all Lithuania as of 1236 in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle.[24]

In 1236 the pope declared a crusade against the Lithuanians.[25] The Samogitians, led by Vykintas, Mindaugas' rival,[26] soundly defeated the Livonian Brothers and their allies in the Battle of Saule in 1236, which forced the Brothers to merge with the Teutonic Knights in 1237.[27] But Lithuania was trapped between the two branches of the Order.[25]

Around 1240, Mindaugas ruled over all of Aukštaitija. Afterwards, he conquered the Black Ruthenia region (which consisted of Grodno, Brest, Navahrudak and the surrounding territories).[11] Mindaugas was in process of extending his control to other areas, killing rivals or sending relatives and members of rival clans east to Ruthenia so they could conquer and settle there. They did that, but they also rebelled. The Ruthenian duke Daniel of Galicia sensed an occasion to recover Black Ruthenia and in 1249–1250 organized a powerful anti-Mindaugas (and ""anti-pagan"") coalition that included Mindaugas' rivals, Yotvingians, Samogitians and the Livonian Teutonic Knights. Mindaugas, however, took advantage of the divergent interests in the coalition he faced.[28]

In 1250, Mindaugas entered into an agreement with the Teutonic Order; he consented to receive baptism (the act took place in 1251) and relinquish his claim over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a royal crown in return.[29] Mindaugas was then able to withstand a military assault from the remaining coalition in 1251, and, supported by the Knights, emerge as a victor to confirm his rule over Lithuania.[30]

On 17 July 1251, Pope Innocent IV signed two papal bulls that ordered the Bishop of Chełmno to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and build a cathedral.[31] In 1253, Mindaugas was crowned and a Kingdom of Lithuania was established for the first and only time in Lithuanian history.[32][33] Mindaugas ""granted"" parts of Yotvingia and Samogitia that he did not control to the Knights in 1253–1259. A peace with Daniel of Galicia in 1254 was cemented by a marriage deal involving Mindaugas' daughter and Daniel's son Shvarn. Mindaugas' nephew Tautvilas returned to his Duchy of Polotsk and Samogitia separated, soon to be ruled by another nephew, Treniota.[30]

In 1260, the Samogitians, victorious over the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Durbe, agreed to submit themselves to Mindaugas' rule on the condition that he abandons the Christian religion; the king complied by terminating the emergent conversion of his country, renewed anti-Teutonic warfare (in the struggle for Samogitia)[34] and expanded further his Ruthenian holdings.[35] It is not clear whether this was accompanied by his personal apostasy.[11][34] Mindaugas thus established the basic tenets of medieval Lithuanian policy: defense against the German Order expansion from the west and north and conquest of Ruthenia in the south and east.[11]

Mindaugas was the principal founder of the Lithuanian state. He established for a while a Christian kingdom under the pope rather than the Holy Roman Empire, at a time when the remaining pagan peoples of Europe were no longer being converted peacefully, but conquered.[36]

Mindaugas was murdered in 1263 by Daumantas of Pskov and Treniota, an event that resulted in great unrest and civil war. Treniota, who took over the rule of the Lithuanian territories, murdered Tautvilas, but was killed himself in 1264. The rule of Mindaugas' son Vaišvilkas followed. He was the first Lithuanian duke known to become an Orthodox Christian and settle in Ruthenia, establishing a pattern to be followed by many others.[34] Vaišvilkas was killed in 1267. A power struggle between Shvarn and Traidenis resulted; it ended in a victory for the latter. Traidenis' reign (1269–1282) was the longest and most stable during the period of unrest. Tradenis reunified all Lithuanian lands, repeatedly raided Ruthenia and Poland with success, defeated the Teutonic Knights in Prussia and in Livonia at the Battle of Aizkraukle in 1279. He also became the ruler of Yotvingia, Semigalia and eastern Prussia. Friendly relations with Poland followed, and in 1279, Tradenis' daughter Gaudemunda of Lithuania married Bolesław II of Masovia, a Piast duke.[11][35]

Pagan Lithuania was a target of northern Christian crusades of the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order.[37] In 1241, 1259 and 1275, Lithuania was also ravaged by raids from the Golden Horde, which earlier (1237–1240) debilitated Kievan Rus'.[35] After Traidenis' death, the German Knights finalized their conquests of Western Baltic tribes, and they could concentrate on Lithuania,[38] especially on Samogitia, to connect the two branches of the Order.[35] A particular opportunity opened in 1274 after the conclusion of the Great Prussian Rebellion and the conquest of the Old Prussian tribe. The Teutonic Knights then proceeded to conquer other Baltic tribes: the Nadruvians and Skalvians in 1274–1277 and the Yotvingians in 1283. The Livonian Order completed its conquest of Semigalia, the last Baltic ally of Lithuania, in 1291.[27]

The family of Gediminas, whose members were about to form Lithuania's great native dynasty,[39] took over the rule of the Grand Duchy in 1285 under Butigeidis. Vytenis (r. 1295–1315) and Gediminas (r. 1315–1341), after whom the Gediminid dynasty is named, had to deal with constant raids and incursions from the Teutonic orders that were costly to repulse. Vytenis fought them effectively around 1298 and at about the same time was able to ally Lithuania with the German burghers of Riga. For their part, the Prussian Knights instigated a rebellion in Samogitia against the Lithuanian ruler in 1299–1300, followed by twenty incursions there in 1300–15.[35] Gediminas also fought the Teutonic Knights, and besides that made shrewd diplomatic moves by cooperating with the government of Riga in 1322–23 and taking advantage of the conflict between the Knights and Archbishop Friedrich von Pernstein of Riga.[40]

Gediminas expanded Lithuania's international connections by conducting correspondence with Pope John XXII as well as with rulers and other centers of power in Western Europe, and he invited German colonists to settle in Lithuania.[41] Responding to Gediminas' complaints about the aggression from the Teutonic Order, the pope forced the Knights to observe a four-year peace with Lithuania in 1324–1327.[40] Opportunities for the Christianization of Lithuania were investigated by the pope's legates, but they met with no success.[40] From the time of Mindaugas, the country's rulers attempted to break Lithuania's cultural isolation, join Western Christendom and thus be protected from the Knights, but the Knights and other interests had been able to block the process.[42] In the 14th century, Gediminas' attempts to become baptized (1323–1324) and establish Catholic Christianity in his country were thwarted by the Samogitians and Gediminas' Orthodox courtiers.[41] In 1325, Casimir, the son of the Polish king Władysław I, married Gediminas' daughter Aldona, who became queen of Poland when Casimir ascended the Polish throne in 1333. The marriage confirmed the prestige of the Lithuanian state under Gediminas, and a defensive alliance with Poland was concluded the same year. Yearly incursions of the Knights resumed in 1328–1340, to which the Lithuanians responded with raids into Prussia and Latvia.[11][40]

The reign of Grand Duke Gediminas constituted the first period in Lithuanian history in which the country was recognized as a great power, mainly due to the extent of its territorial expansion into Ruthenia.[11][43] Lithuania was unique in Europe as a pagan-ruled ""kingdom"" and fast-growing military power suspended between the worlds of Byzantine and Latin Christianity. To be able to afford the extremely costly defense against the Teutonic Knights, it had to expand to the east. Gediminas accomplished Lithuania's eastern expansion by challenging the Mongols, who from the 1230s sponsored a Mongol invasion of Rus'.[44] The collapse of the political structure of Kievan Rus' created a partial regional power vacuum that Lithuania was able to exploit.[42] Through alliances and conquest, in competition with the Principality of Moscow,[40] the Lithuanians eventually gained control of vast expanses of the western and southern portions of the former Kievan Rus'.[11][43] Gediminas' conquests included the western Smolensk region, southern Polesia and (temporarily) Kyiv, which was ruled around 1330 by Gediminas' brother Fiodor.[40] The Lithuanian-controlled area of Ruthenia grew to include most of modern Belarus and Ukraine (the Dnieper River basin) and comprised a massive state that stretched from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea in the 14th and 15th centuries.[42][43]

In the 14th century, many Lithuanian princes installed to govern the Ruthenia lands accepted Eastern Christianity and assumed Ruthenian custom and names in order to appeal to the culture of their subjects. Through this means, integration into the Lithuanian state structure was accomplished without disturbing local ways of life.[11] The Ruthenian territories acquired were vastly larger, more densely populated and more highly developed in terms of church organization and literacy than the territories of core Lithuania. Thus the Lithuanian state was able to function because of the contributions of the Ruthenian culture representatives.[42] Historical territories of the former Ruthenian dukedoms were preserved under the Lithuanian rule, and the further they were from Vilnius, the more autonomous the localities tended to be.[45] Lithuanian soldiers and Ruthenians together defended Ruthenian strongholds, at times paying tribute to the Golden Horde for some of the outlying localities.[40] Ruthenian lands may have been ruled jointly by Lithuania and the Golden Horde as condominiums until the time of Vytautas, who stopped paying tribute.[46] Gediminas' state provided a counterbalance against the influence of Moscow and enjoyed good relations with the Ruthenian principalities of Pskov, Veliky Novgorod and Tver. Direct military confrontations with the Principality of Moscow under Ivan I occurred around 1335.[40]

Around 1318, Gediminas' elder son Algirdas married Maria of Vitebsk, the daughter of Prince Yaroslav of Vitebsk, and settled in Vitebsk to rule the principality.[40] Of Gediminas' seven sons, four remained pagan and three converted to Orthodox Christianity.[11] Upon his death, Gediminas divided his domains among the seven sons, but Lithuania's precarious military situation, especially on the Teutonic frontier, forced the brothers to keep the country together.[47] From 1345, Algirdas took over as the Grand Duke of Lithuania. In practice, he ruled over Lithuanian Ruthenia only, whereas Lithuania proper was the domain of his equally able brother Kęstutis. Algirdas fought the Golden Horde Tatars and the Principality of Moscow; Kęstutis took upon himself the demanding struggle with the Teutonic Order.[11]

The warfare with the Teutonic Order continued from 1345, and in 1348, the Knights defeated the Lithuanians at the Battle of Strėva. Kęstutis requested King Casimir of Poland to mediate with the pope in hopes of converting Lithuania to Christianity, but the result was negative, and Poland took from Lithuania in 1349 the Halych area and some Ruthenian lands further north. Lithuania's situation improved from 1350, when Algirdas formed an alliance with the Principality of Tver. Halych was ceded by Lithuania, which brought peace with Poland in 1352. Secured by those alliances, Algirdas and Kęstutis embarked on the implementation of policies to expand Lithuania's territories further.[47]

Bryansk was taken in 1359, and in 1362, Algirdas captured Kyiv after defeating the Mongols at the Battle of Blue Waters.[43][44][47] Volhynia, Podolia and left-bank Ukraine were also incorporated. Kęstutis heroically fought for the survival of ethnic Lithuanians by attempting to repel about thirty incursions by the Teutonic Knights and their European guest fighters.[11] Kęstutis also attacked the Teutonic possessions in Prussia on numerous occasions, but the Knights took Kaunas in 1362.[48] The dispute with Poland renewed itself and was settled by the peace of 1366, when Lithuania gave up a part of Volhynia including Volodymyr. A peace with the Livonian Knights was also accomplished in 1367. In 1368, 1370 and 1372, Algirdas invaded the Grand Duchy of Moscow and each time approached Moscow itself. An ""eternal"" peace (the Treaty of Lyubutsk) was concluded after the last attempt, and it was much needed by Lithuania due to its involvement in heavy fighting with the Knights again in 1373–1377.[48]

The two brothers and Gediminas' other offspring left many ambitious sons with inherited territory. Their rivalry weakened the country in the face of the Teutonic expansion and the newly assertive Grand Duchy of Moscow, buoyed by the 1380 victory over the Golden Horde at the Battle of Kulikovo and intent on the unification of all Rus' lands under its rule.[11]

Algirdas died in 1377, and his son Jogaila became grand duke while Kęstutis was still alive. The Teutonic pressure was at its peak, and Jogaila was inclined to cease defending Samogitia in order to concentrate on preserving the Ruthenian empire of Lithuania. The Knights exploited the differences between Jogaila and Kęstutis and procured a separate armistice with the older duke in 1379. Jogaila then made overtures to the Teutonic Order and concluded the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės with them in 1380, contrary to Kęstutis' principles and interests. Kęstutis felt he could no longer support his nephew and in 1381, when Jogaila's forces were preoccupied with quenching a rebellion in Polotsk, he entered Vilnius in order to remove Jogaila from the throne. A Lithuanian civil war ensued. Kęstutis' two raids against Teutonic possessions in 1382 brought back the tradition of his past exploits, but Jogaila retook Vilnius during his uncle's absence. Kęstutis was captured and died in Jogaila's custody. Kęstutis' son Vytautas escaped.[11][44][49]

Jogaila agreed to the Treaty of Dubysa with the Order in 1382, an indication of his weakness. A four-year truce stipulated Jogaila's conversion to Catholicism and the cession of half of Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas went to Prussia in seek of the support of the Knights for his claims, including the Duchy of Trakai, which he considered inherited from his father. Jogaila's refusal to submit to the demands of his cousin and the Knights resulted in their joint invasion of Lithuania in 1383. Vytautas, however, having failed to gain the entire duchy, established contacts with the grand duke. Upon receiving from him the areas of Grodno, Podlasie and Brest, Vytautas switched sides in 1384 and destroyed the border strongholds entrusted to him by the Order. In 1384, the two Lithuanian dukes, acting together, waged a successful expedition against the lands ruled by the Order.[11]

By that time, for the sake of its long-term survival, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had initiated the processes leading to its imminent acceptance of European Christendom.[11] The Teutonic Knights aimed at a territorial unification of their Prussian and Livonian branches by conquering Samogitia and all of Lithuania proper, following the earlier subordination of the Prussian and Latvian tribes. To dominate the neighboring Baltic and Slavic people and expand into a great Baltic power, the Knights used German and other volunteer fighters. They unleashed 96 onslaughts in Lithuania during the period 1345–1382, against which the Lithuanians were able to respond with only 42 retributive raids of their own. Lithuania's Ruthenian empire in the east was also threatened by both the unification of Rus' ambitions of Moscow and the centrifugal activities pursued by the rulers of some of the more distant provinces.[50]

The Lithuanian state of the later 14th century was primarily binational, Lithuanian and Ruthenian (in territories that correspond to the modern Belarus and Ukraine). Of its 800,000 square kilometers total area, 10% comprised ethnic Lithuania, probably populated by no more than 300,000 inhabitants. Lithuania was dependent for its survival on the human and material resources of the Ruthenian lands.[51]

The increasingly differentiated Lithuanian society was led by princes of the Gediminid and Rurik dynasties and the descendants of former kunigas chiefs from families such as the Giedraitis, Olshanski and Svirski. Below them in rank was the regular Lithuanian nobility (or boyars), in Lithuania proper strictly subjected to the princes and generally living on modest family farms, each tended by a few feudal subjects or, more often, slave workers if the boyar could afford them. For their military and administrative services, Lithuanian boyars were compensated by exemptions from public contributions, payments, and Ruthenian land grants. The majority of the ordinary rural workers were free. They were obligated to provide crafts and numerous contributions and services; for not paying these types of debts (or for other offences), one could be forced into slavery.[11][52]

The Ruthenian princes were Orthodox, and many Lithuanian princes also converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, even some who resided in Lithuania proper, or at least their wives. The masonry Ruthenian churches and monasteries housed learned monks, their writings (including Gospel translations such as the Ostromir Gospels) and collections of religious art. A Ruthenian quarter populated by Lithuania's Orthodox subjects, and containing their church, existed in Vilnius from the 14th century. The grand dukes' chancery in Vilnius was staffed by Orthodox churchmen, who, trained in the Church Slavonic language, developed Chancery Slavonic, a Ruthenian written language useful for official record keeping. The most important of the Grand Duchy's documents, the Lithuanian Metrica, the Lithuanian Chronicles and the Statutes of Lithuania, were all written in that language.[53]

German, Jewish and Armenian settlers were invited to live in Lithuania; the last two groups established their own denominational communities directly under the ruling dukes. The Tatars and Crimean Karaites were entrusted as soldiers for the dukes' personal guard.[53]

Towns developed to a much lesser degree than in nearby Prussia or Livonia. Outside of Ruthenia, the only cities were Vilnius (Gediminas' capital from 1323), the old capital of Trakai and Kaunas.[11][13][33] Kernavė and Kreva were the other old political centers.[40] Vilnius in the 14th century was a major social, cultural and trading center. It linked economically central and eastern Europe with the Baltic area. Vilnius merchants enjoyed privileges that allowed them to trade over most of the territories of the Lithuanian state. Of the passing Ruthenian, Polish and German merchants (many from Riga), many settled in Vilnius and some built masonry residencies. The city was ruled by a governor named by the grand duke and its system of fortifications included three castles. Foreign currencies and Lithuanian currency (from the 13th century) were widely used.[11][54]

The Lithuanian state maintained a patrimonial power structure. Gediminid rule was hereditary, but the ruler would choose the son he considered most able to be his successor. Councils existed, but could only advise the duke. The huge state was divided into a hierarchy of territorial units administered by designated officials who were also empowered in judicial and military matters.[11]

The Lithuanians spoke in a number of Aukštaitian and Samogitian (West-Baltic) dialects. But the tribal peculiarities were disappearing and the increasing use of the name Lietuva was a testimony to the developing Lithuanian sense of separate identity. The forming Lithuanian feudal system preserved many aspects of the earlier societal organization, such as the family clan structure, free peasantry and some slavery. The land belonged now to the ruler and the nobility. Patterns imported primarily from Ruthenia were used for the organization of the state and its structure of power.[55]

Following the establishment of Western Christianity at the end of the 14th century, the occurrence of pagan cremation burial ceremonies markedly decreased.[56]

As the power of the Lithuanian warlord dukes expanded to the south and east, the cultivated East Slavic Ruthenians exerted influence on the Lithuanian ruling class.[57] They brought with them the Church Slavonic liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Christian religion, a written language (Chancery Slavonic) that was developed to serve the Lithuanian court's document-producing needs for a few centuries, and a system of laws. By these means, Ruthenians transformed Vilnius into a major center of Kievan Rus' civilization.[57] By the time of Jogaila's acceptance of Catholicism at the Union of Krewo in 1385, many institutions in his realm and members of his family had been to a large extent assimilated already into the Orthodox Christianity and became Russified (in part a result of the deliberate policy of the Gediminid ruling house).[57][58]

Catholic influence and contacts, including those derived from German settlers, traders and missionaries from Riga,[59] had been increasing for some time around the northwest region of the empire, known as Lithuania proper. The Franciscan and Dominican friar orders existed in Vilnius from the time of Gediminas. Kęstutis in 1349 and Algirdas in 1358 negotiated Christianization with the pope, the Holy Roman Empire and the Polish king. The Christianization of Lithuania thus involved both Catholic and Orthodox aspects. Conversion by force as practiced by the Teutonic Knights had actually been an impediment that delayed the progress of Western Christianity in the grand duchy.[11]

Jogaila, a grand duke since 1377, was himself still a pagan at the start of his reign. In 1386, agreed to the offer of the Polish crown by leading Polish nobles, who were eager to take advantage of Lithuania's expansion, if he become a Catholic and married the 13-year-old crowned king (not queen) Jadwiga.[60] For the near future, Poland gave Lithuania a valuable ally against increasing threats from the Teutonic Knights and the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Lithuania, in which Ruthenians outnumbered ethnic Lithuanians by several times, could ally with either the Grand Duchy of Moscow or Poland. A Russian deal was also negotiated with Dmitry Donskoy in 1383–1384, but Moscow was too distant to be able to assist with the problems posed by the Teutonic orders and presented a difficulty as a center competing for the loyalty of the Orthodox Lithuanian Ruthenians.[11][58]

Jogaila was baptized, given the baptismal name Władysław, married Queen Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland in February 1386.[61][62]

Jogaila's baptism and crowning were followed by the final and official Christianization of Lithuania.[63] In the fall of 1386, the king returned to Lithuania and the next spring and summer participated in mass conversion and baptism ceremonies for the general population.[64] The establishment of a bishopric in Vilnius in 1387 was accompanied by Jogaila's extraordinarily generous endowment of land and peasants to the Church and exemption from state obligations and control. This instantly transformed the Lithuanian Church into the most powerful institution in the country (and future grand dukes lavished even more wealth on it). Lithuanian boyars who accepted baptism were rewarded with a more limited privilege improving their legal rights.[65][66] Vilnius' townspeople were granted self-government. The Church proceeded with its civilizing mission of literacy and education, and the estates of the realm started to emerge with their own separate identities.[56]

Jogaila's orders for his court and followers to convert to Catholicism were meant to deprive the Teutonic Knights of the justification for their practice of forced conversion through military onslaughts. In 1403 the pope prohibited the Order from conducting warfare against Lithuania, and its threat to Lithuania's existence (which had endured for two centuries) was indeed neutralized. In the short term, Jogaila needed Polish support in his struggle with his cousin Vytautas.[56][58]

The Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–1392 involved the Teutonic Knights, the Poles, and the competing factions loyal to Jogaila and Vytautas in Lithuania. Amid ruthless warfare, the grand duchy was ravaged and threatened with collapse. Jogaila decided that the way out was to make amends and recognize the rights of Vytautas, whose original goal, now largely accomplished, was to recover the lands he considered his inheritance. After negotiations, Vytautas ended up gaining far more than that; from 1392 he became practically the ruler of Lithuania, a self-styled ""Duke of Lithuania,"" under a compromise with Jogaila known as the Ostrów Agreement. Technically, he was merely Jogaila's regent with extended authority. Jogaila realized that cooperating with his able cousin was preferable to attempting to govern (and defend) Lithuania directly from Kraków.[66][67]

Vytautas had been frustrated by Jogaila's Polish arrangements and rejected the prospect of Lithuania's subordination to Poland.[68] Under Vytautas, a considerable centralization of the state took place, and the Catholicized Lithuanian nobility became increasingly prominent in state politics.[69] The centralization efforts began in 1393–1395, when Vytautas appropriated their provinces from several powerful regional dukes in Ruthenia.[70] Several invasions of Lithuania by the Teutonic Knights occurred between 1392 and 1394, but they were repelled with the help of Polish forces. Afterwards, the Knights abandoned their goal of conquest of Lithuania proper and concentrated on subjugating and keeping Samogitia. In 1395, Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, the Order's formal superior, prohibited the Knights from raiding Lithuania.[71]

In 1395, Vytautas conquered Smolensk, and in 1397, he conducted a victorious expedition against a branch of the Golden Horde. Now he felt he could afford independence from Poland and in 1398 refused to pay the tribute due to Queen Jadwiga. Seeking freedom to pursue his internal and Ruthenian goals, Vytautas had to grant the Teutonic Order a large portion of Samogitia in the Treaty of Salynas of 1398. The conquest of Samogitia by the Teutonic Order greatly improved its military position as well as that of the associated Livonian Brothers of the Sword. Vytautas soon pursued attempts to retake the territory, an undertaking for which needed the help of the Polish king.[71][72]

During Vytautas' reign, Lithuania reached the peak of its territorial expansion, but his ambitious plans to subjugate all of Ruthenia were thwarted by his disastrous defeat in 1399 at the Battle of the Vorskla River, inflicted by the Golden Horde. Vytautas survived by fleeing the battlefield with a small unit and realized the necessity of a permanent alliance with Poland.[71][72]

The original Union of Krewo of 1385 was renewed and redefined on several occasions, but each time with little clarity due to the competing Polish and Lithuanian interests. Fresh arrangements were agreed to in the ""unions"" of Vilnius (1401), Horodło (1413), Grodno (1432) and Vilnius (1499).[73] In the Union of Vilnius, Jogaila granted Vytautas a lifetime rule over the grand duchy. In return, Jogaila preserved his formal supremacy, and Vytautas promised to ""stand faithfully with the Crown and the King."" Warfare with the Order resumed. In 1403, Pope Boniface IX banned the Knights from attacking Lithuania, but in the same year Lithuania had to agree to the Peace of Raciąż, which mandated the same conditions as in the Treaty of Salynas.[74]

Secure in the west, Vytautas turned his attention to the east once again. The campaigns fought between 1401 and 1408 involved Smolensk, Pskov, Moscow and Veliky Novgorod. Smolensk was retained, Pskov and Veliki Novgorod ended up as Lithuanian dependencies, and a lasting territorial division between the Grand Duchy and Moscow was agreed in 1408 in the treaty of Ugra, where a great battle failed to materialize.[74][75]

The decisive war with the Teutonic Knights (the Great War) was preceded in 1409 with a Samogitian uprising supported by Vytautas. Ultimately the Lithuanian–Polish alliance was able to defeat the Knights at the Battle of Grunwald on 15 July 1410, but the allied armies failed to take Marienburg, the Knights' fortress-capital. Nevertheless, the unprecedented total battlefield victory against the Knights permanently removed the threat that they had posed to Lithuania's existence for centuries. The Peace of Thorn (1411) allowed Lithuania to recover Samogotia, but only until the deaths of Jogaila and Vytautas, and the Knights had to pay a large monetary reparation.[76][77][78]

The Union of Horodło (1413) incorporated Lithuania into Poland again, but only as a formality. In practical terms, Lithuania became an equal partner with Poland, because each country was obliged to choose its future ruler only with the consent of the other, and the Union was declared to continue even under a new dynasty. Catholic Lithuanian boyars were to enjoy the same privileges as Polish nobles (szlachta). 47 top Lithuanian clans were colligated with 47 Polish noble families to initiate a future brotherhood and facilitate the expected full unity. Two administrative divisions (Vilnius and Trakai) were established in Lithuania, patterned after the existing Polish models.[79][80]

Vytautas practiced religious toleration and his grandiose plans also included attempts to influence the Eastern Orthodox Church, which he wanted to use as a tool to control Moscow and other parts of Ruthenia. In 1416, he elevated Gregory Tsamblak as his chosen Orthodox patriarch for all of Ruthenia (the established Orthodox Metropolitan bishop remained in Vilnius to the end of the 18th century).[70][81] These efforts were also intended to serve the goal of global unification of the Eastern and Western churches. Tsamblak led an Orthodox delegation to the Council of Constance in 1418.[82] The Orthodox synod, however, would not recognize Tsamblak.[81] The grand duke also established new Catholic bishoprics in Samogitia (1417)[82] and in Lithuanian Ruthenia (Lutsk and Kyiv).[81]

The Gollub War with the Teutonic Knights followed and in 1422, in the Treaty of Melno, the grand duchy permanently recovered Samogitia, which terminated its involvement in the wars with the Order.[83] Vytautas' shifting policies and reluctance to pursue the Order made the survival of German East Prussia possible for centuries to come.[84] Samogitia was the last region of Europe to be Christianized (from 1413).[82][85] Later, different foreign policies were prosecuted by Lithuania and Poland, accompanied by conflicts over Podolia and Volhynia, the grand duchy's territories in the southeast.[86]

Vytautas' greatest successes and recognition occurred at the end of his life, when the Crimean Khanate and the Volga Tatars came under his influence. Prince Vasily I of Moscow died in 1425, and Vytautas then administered the Grand Duchy of Moscow together with his daughter, Vasily's widow Sophia of Lithuania. In 1426–1428 Vytautas triumphantly toured the eastern reaches of his empire and collected huge tributes from the local princes.[84] Pskov and Veliki Novgorod were incorporated to the grand duchy in 1426 and 1428.[82] At the Congress of Lutsk in 1429, Vytautas negotiated the issue of his crowning as the King of Lithuania with Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and Jogaila. That ambition was close to being fulfilled, but in the end was thwarted by last-minute intrigues and Vytautas' death. Vytautas' cult and legend originated during his later years and have continued until today.[84]

The dynastic link to Poland resulted in religious, political and cultural ties and increase of Western influence among the native Lithuanian nobility, and to a lesser extent among the Ruthenian boyars from the East, Lithuanian subjects.[68] Catholics were granted preferential treatment and access to offices because of the policies of Vytautas, officially pronounced in 1413 at the Union of Horodło, and even more so of his successors, aimed at asserting the rule of the Catholic Lithuanian elite over the Ruthenian territories.[69] Such policies increased the pressure on the nobility to convert to Catholicism. Ethnic Lithuania proper made up 10% of the area and 20% of the population of the Grand Duchy. Of the Ruthenian provinces, Volhynia was most closely integrated with Lithuania proper. Branches of the Gediminid family as well as other Lithuanian and Ruthenian magnate clans eventually became established there.[70]

During the period, a stratum of wealthy landowners, important also as a military force, was coming into being,[87] accompanied by the emerging class of feudal serfs assigned to them.[70] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was for the time being largely preserved as a separate state with separate institutions, but efforts, originating mainly in Poland, were made to bring the Polish and Lithuanian elites and systems closer together.[79][80] Vilnius and other cities were granted the German system of laws (Magdeburg rights). Crafts and trade were developing quickly. Under Vytautas a network of chanceries functioned, first schools were established and annals written. Taking advantage of the historic opportunities, the great ruler opened Lithuania for the influence of the European culture and integrated his country with European Western Christianity.[82][87]

The Jagiellonian dynasty founded by Jogaila (a member of one of the branches of the Gediminids) ruled Poland and Lithuania continuously between 1386 and 1572.

Following the deaths of Vytautas in 1430, another civil war ensued, and Lithuania was ruled by rival successors. Afterwards, the Lithuanian nobility on two occasions technically broke the union between Poland and Lithuania by selecting grand dukes unilaterally from the Jagiellonian dynasty. In 1440, the Lithuanian great lords elevated Casimir, Jogaila's second son, to the rule of the grand duchy. This issue was resolved by Casimir's election as king by the Poles in 1446. In 1492, Jogaila's grandson John Albert became the king of Poland, whereas his grandson Alexander became the grand duke of Lithuania. In 1501 Alexander succeeded John as king of Poland, which resolved the difficulty in the same manner as before.[72] A lasting connection between the two states was beneficial to Poles, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians, Catholic and Orthodox, as well as the Jagiellonian rulers themselves, whose hereditary succession rights in Lithuania practically guaranteed their election as kings in accordance with the customs surrounding the royal elections in Poland.[73]

On the Teutonic front, Poland continued its struggle, which in 1466 led to the Peace of Thorn and the recovery of much of the Piast dynasty territorial losses. A secular Duchy of Prussia was established in 1525. Its presence would greatly impact the futures of both Lithuania and Poland.[88]

The Tatar Crimean Khanate recognized the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire from 1475. Seeking slaves and booty, the Tatars raided vast portions of the grand duchy of Lithuania, burning Kyiv in 1482 and approaching Vilnius in 1505. Their activity resulted in Lithuania's loss of its distant territories on the Black Sea shores in the 1480s and 1490s. The last two Jagiellon kings were Sigismund I and Sigismund II Augustus, during whose reign the intensity of Tatar raids diminished due to the appearance of the military caste of Cossacks at the southeastern territories and the growing power of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[89]

Lithuania needed a close alliance with Poland when, at the end of the 15th century, the increasingly assertive Grand Duchy of Moscow threatened some of Lithuania's Rus' principalities with the goal of ""recovering"" the formerly Orthodox-ruled lands. In 1492, Ivan III of Russia unleashed what turned out to be a series of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars and Livonian Wars.[90]

In 1492, the border of Lithuania's loosely controlled eastern Ruthenian territory ran less than one hundred miles from Moscow. But as a result of the warfare, a third of the grand duchy's land area was ceded to the Russian state in 1503. Then the loss of Smolensk in July 1514 was particularly disastrous, even though it was followed by the successful Battle of Orsha in September, as the Polish interests were reluctantly recognizing the necessity of their own involvement in Lithuania's defense. The peace of 1537 left Gomel as the grand duchy's eastern edge.[90]

In the north, the Livonian War took place over the strategically and economically crucial region of Livonia, the traditional territory of the Livonian Order. The Livonian Confederation formed an alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian side in 1557 with the Treaty of Pozvol. Desired by both Lithuania and Poland, Livonia was then incorporated into the Polish Crown by Sigismund II. These developments caused Ivan the Terrible of Russia to launch attacks in Livonia beginning in 1558, and later on Lithuania. The grand duchy's fortress of Polotsk fell in 1563. This was followed by a Lithuanian victory at the Battle of Ula in 1564, but not a recovery of Polotsk. Russian, Swedish and Polish-Lithuanian occupations subdivided Livonia.[91]

The Polish ruling establishment had been aiming at the incorporation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into Poland since before the Union of Krewo.[92] The Lithuanians were able to fend off this threat in the 14th and 15th centuries, but the dynamics of power changed in the 16th century. In 1508, the Polish Sejm voted funding for Lithuania's defense against Muscovy for the first time, and an army was fielded. The Polish nobility's executionist movement called for full incorporation of the Grand Duchy because of its increasing reliance on the support of the Polish Crown against Moscow's encroachments. This problem only grew more acute during the reign of Sigismund II Augustus, the last Jagiellonian king and grand duke of Lithuania, who had no heir who would inherit and continue the personal union between Poland and Lithuania. The preservation of the Polish-Lithuanian power arrangement appeared to require the monarch to force a decisive solution during his lifetime. The resistance to a closer and more permanent union was coming from Lithuania's ruling families, increasingly Polonized in cultural terms, but attached to the Lithuanian heritage and their patrimonial rule.[93][94]

Legal evolution had lately been taking place in Lithuania nevertheless. In the Privilege of Vilnius of 1563, Sigismund restored full political rights to the Grand Duchy's Orthodox boyars, which had been restricted up to that time by Vytautas and his successors; all members of the nobility were from then officially equal. Elective courts were established in 1565–66, and the Second Lithuanian Statute of 1566 created a hierarchy of local offices patterned on the Polish system. The Lithuanian legislative assembly assumed the same formal powers as the Polish Sejm.[93][94]

The Polish Sejm of January 1569, deliberating in Lublin, was attended by the Lithuanian lords at Sigismund's insistence. Most left town on 1 March, unhappy with the proposals of the Poles to establish rights to acquire property in Lithuania and other issues. Sigismund reacted by announcing the incorporation of the Grand Duchy's Volhynia and Podlasie voivodeships into the Polish Crown. Soon the large Kiev Voivodeship and Bratslav Voivodeship were also annexed. Ruthenian boyars in the formerly southeastern Grand Duchy mostly approved the territorial transfers, since it meant that they would become members of the privileged Polish nobility. But the king also pressured many obstinate deputies to agree on compromises important to the Lithuanian side. The arm twisting, combined with reciprocal guarantees for Lithuanian nobles' rights, resulted in the ""voluntary"" passage of the Union of Lublin on July 1. The combined polity would be ruled by a common Sejm, but the separate hierarchies of major state offices were to be retained. Many in the Lithuanian establishment found this objectionable, but in the end they were prudent to comply. For the time being, Sigismund managed to preserve the Polish-Lithuanian state as great power. Reforms necessary to protect its long-term success and survival were not undertaken.[93][94]

From the 16th to the mid-17th century, culture, arts, and education flourished in Lithuania, fueled by the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. The Lutheran ideas of the Reformation entered the Livonian Confederation by the 1520s, and Lutheranism soon became the prevailing religion in the urban areas of the region, while Lithuania remained Catholic.[95][96]

An influential book dealer was the humanist and bibliophile Francysk Skaryna (c. 1485—1540), who was the founding father of Belarusian letters. He wrote in his native Ruthenian (Chancery Slavonic) language,[97] as was typical for literati in the earlier phase of the Renaissance in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the middle of the 16th century, Polish predominated in literary productions.[98] Many educated Lithuanians came back from studies abroad to help build the active cultural life that distinguished 16th-century Lithuania, sometimes referred to as Lithuanian Renaissance (not to be confused with Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century).

At this time, Italian architecture was introduced in Lithuanian cities, and Lithuanian literature written in Latin flourished. Also at this time, the first printed texts in the Lithuanian language emerged, and the formation of written Lithuanian language began. The process was led by Lithuanian scholars Abraomas Kulvietis, Stanislovas Rapalionis, Martynas Mažvydas and Mikalojus Daukša.

With the Union of Lublin of 1569, Poland and Lithuania formed a new state referred to as the Republic of Both Nations, but commonly known as Poland-Lithuania or the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, which officially consisted of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was ruled by Polish and Lithuanian nobility, together with nobility-elected kings. The Union was designed to have a common foreign policy, customs and currency. Separate Polish and Lithuanian armies were retained, but parallel ministerial and central offices were established according to a practice developed by the Crown.[94] The Lithuanian Tribunal, a high court for the affairs of the nobility, was created in 1581.[99]

Following the death of Sigismund II Augustus in 1572, a joint Polish–Lithuanian monarch was to be elected as agreed in the Union of Lublin. According to the treaty, the title ""Grand Duke of Lithuania"" would be received by a jointly elected monarch in the Election sejm on his accession to the throne, thus losing its former institutional significance. However, the treaty guaranteed that the institution and the title ""Grand Duke of Lithuania"" will be preserved.[100][101]

On 20 April 1576 the congress of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's nobles was held in Grodno which adopted an Universal. It was signed by the participating Lithuanian nobles who announced that if the delegates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania will feel pressure from the Poles in the Election sejm, the Lithuanians will not be obliged by an oath of the Union of Lublin and will have the right to select a separate monarch.[102] On 29 May 1580 a ceremony was held in the Vilnius Cathedral during which bishop Merkelis Giedraitis presented Stephen Báthory (King of Poland since 1 May 1576) a luxuriously decorated sword and a cap adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself). Such ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, thus ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin.[103][104]

The Lithuanian language fell into disuse in the circles of the grand ducal court in the second half of the 15th century in favor of Polish.[105] A century later, Polish was commonly used even by the ordinary Lithuanian nobility.[105] Following the Union of Lublin, Polonization increasingly affected all aspects of Lithuanian public life, but it took well over a century for the process to be completed. The 1588 Statutes of Lithuania were still written in the Ruthenian Chancery Slavonic language, just as earlier legal codifications were.[106] From about 1700, Polish was used in the Grand Duchy's official documents as a replacement for Ruthenian and Latin use.[107][108] The Lithuanian nobility became linguistically and culturally Polonized, while retaining a sense of Lithuanian identity.[109] The integrating process of the Commonwealth nobility was not regarded as Polonization in the sense of modern nationality, but rather as participation in the Sarmatism cultural-ideological current, erroneously understood to imply also a common (Sarmatian) ancestry of all members of the noble class.[108] The Lithuanian language survived, however, in spite of encroachments by the Ruthenian, Polish, Russian, Belarusian and German languages, as a peasant vernacular, and from 1547 in written religious use.[110]

Western Lithuania had an important role in the preservation of the Lithuanian language and its culture. In Samogitia, many nobles never ceased to speak Lithuanian natively. Northeastern East Prussia, sometimes referred to as Lithuania Minor, was populated mainly by Lithuanians[111] and predominantly Lutheran. The Lutherans promoted publishing of religious books in local languages, which is why the Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas was printed in 1547 in East Prussian Königsberg.[112]

The predominantly East Slavic population of the Grand Duchy was mostly Eastern Orthodox, and much of the Lithuanian state's nobility also remained Orthodox. Unlike the common people of the Lithuanian realm, at about the time of the Union of Lublin in 1569 large portions of the nobility converted to Western Christianity. Following the Protestant Reformation movement, many noble families converted to Calvinism in the 1550s and 1560s, and typically a generation later, conforming to the Counter-Reformation trends in the Commonwealth, to Roman Catholicism.[113] The Protestant and Orthodox presence must have been very strong, because according to an undoubtedly exaggerated early 17th-century source, ""merely one in a thousand remained a Catholic"" in Lithuania at that time.[114][b] In the early Commonwealth, religious toleration was the norm and was officially enacted by the Warsaw Confederation in 1573.[115]

By 1750, nominal Catholics comprised about 80% of the Commonwealth's population, the vast majority of the noble citizenry, and the entire legislature. In the east, there were also the Eastern Orthodox Church adherents. However, Catholics in the Grand Duchy itself were split. Under half were Latin Church with strong allegiance to Rome, worshiping according to the Roman Rite. The others (mostly non-noble Ruthenians) followed the Byzantine Rite. They were the so-called Uniates, whose church was established at the Union of Brest in 1596, and they acknowledged only nominal obedience to Rome. At first the advantage went to the advancing Catholic Church pushing back a retreating Eastern Orthodox Church. However, after the first partition of the Commonwealth in 1772, the Orthodox had the support of the government and gained the upper hand. The Russian Orthodox Church paid special attention to the Uniates (who had once been Orthodox), and tried to bring them back. The contest was political and spiritual, utilizing missionaries, schools, and pressure exerted by powerful nobles and landlords. By 1800, over 2 million of the Uniates had become Orthodox, and another 1.6 million by 1839.[116][117]

The Union of Lublin and the integration of the two countries notwithstanding, Lithuania continued to exist as a grand duchy within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for over two centuries. It retained separate laws as well as an army and a treasury.[118] At the time of Union of Lublin, King Sigismund II Augustus removed Ukraine and other territories from Lithuania and incorporated them directly into the Polish Crown. The grand duchy was left with today's Belarus and parts of European Russia, in addition to the core ethnic Lithuanian lands.[119] From 1573, the kings of Poland and the grand dukes of Lithuania were always the same person and were elected by the nobility, who were granted ever increasing privileges in a unique aristocratic political system known as the Golden Liberty. These privileges, especially the liberum veto, led to political anarchy and the eventual dissolution of the state.

Within the Commonwealth, the grand duchy made important contributions to European economic, political and cultural life: Western Europe was supplied with grain, along the Danzig to Amsterdam sea route; the early Commonwealth's religious tolerance and democracy among the ruling noble class were unique in Europe; Vilnius was the only European capital located on the border of the worlds of the Western and Eastern Christianity and many religious faiths were practiced there; to the Jews,[c] it was the ""Jerusalem of the North"" and the town of the Vilna Gaon, their great religious leader; Vilnius University produced numerous illustrious alumni and was one of the most influential centers of learning in its part of Europe; the Vilnius school made significant contributions to European architecture in Baroque style; the Lithuanian legal tradition gave rise to the advanced legal codes known as the Statutes of Lithuania; at the end of the Commonwealth's existence, the Constitution of 3 May 1791 was the first comprehensive written constitution produced in Europe. After the Partitions of Poland, the Vilnius school of Romanticism produced the two great poets: Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki.[121]

The Commonwealth was greatly weakened by a series of wars, beginning with the Khmelnytsky Uprising in Ukraine in 1648.[122] During the Northern Wars of 1655–1661, the Lithuanian territory and economy were devastated by the Swedish army in an invasion known as the Deluge, and Vilnius was burned and looted by the Russian forces.[112] Before it could fully recover, Lithuania was again ravaged during the Great Northern War of 1700–1721.

Besides war, the Commonwealth suffered the Great Northern War plague outbreak and famine (the worst caused by the Great Frost of 1709). These calamities resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the country's inhabitants. Foreign powers, especially Russia, became dominant players in the domestic politics of the Commonwealth. Numerous factions among the nobility, controlled and manipulated by the powerful Magnates of Poland and Lithuania, themselves often in conflict, used their ""Golden Liberty"" to prevent reforms. Some Lithuanian clans, such as the Radziwiłłs, counted among the most powerful of Commonwealth nobles.

The Constitution of 3 May 1791 was a culmination of the belated reform process of the Commonwealth. It attempted to integrate Lithuania and Poland more closely, although the separation was preserved by the added Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, 1793 and 1795 terminated its existence and saw the Grand Duchy of Lithuania divided between the Russian Empire, which took over 90% of the Duchy's territory, and the Kingdom of Prussia. The Third Partition of 1795 took place after the failure of the Kościuszko Uprising, the last war waged by Poles and Lithuanians to preserve their statehood. Lithuania ceased to exist as a distinct entity for more than a century.[33]

Following the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian Empire controlled the majority of Lithuania, including Vilnius, which was a part of the Vilna Governorate. In 1803, Tsar Alexander I revived and upgraded the old Jesuit academy as the imperial Vilnius University, the largest in the Russian Empire. The university and the regional educational system was directed on behalf of the tsar by Prince Adam Czartoryski.[123] In the early years of the 19th century, there were signs that Lithuania might be allowed some separate recognition by the Empire, however this never happened.

In 1812, the Lithuanians eagerly welcomed Napoleon Bonaparte's Grande Armée as liberators, with many joining the French invasion of Russia. After the French army's defeat and withdrawal, Tsar Alexander I decided to keep the University of Vilnius open and the Polish-language poet Adam Mickiewicz, a resident of Vilnius in 1815–1824, was able to receive his education there.[124] The southwestern part of Lithuania that was taken over by Prussia in 1795, then incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw (a French puppet state that existed between 1807 and 1815), became a part of the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland (""Congress Poland"") in 1815. The rest of Lithuania continued to be administered as a Russian province.

The Poles and Lithuanians revolted against Russian rule twice, in 1830-31 (the November Uprising) and 1863–64 (the January Uprising), but both attempts failed and resulted in increased repression by the Russian authorities. After the November Uprising, Tsar Nicholas I began an intensive program of Russification and the University of Vilnius was closed.[125] Lithuania became part of a new administrative region called the Northwestern Krai.[126] In spite of the repression, Polish language schooling and cultural life were largely able to continue in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the failure of the January Uprising.[106] The Statutes of Lithuania were annulled by the Russian Empire only in 1840, and serfdom was abolished as part of the general Emancipation reform of 1861 that applied to the entire Russian Empire.[127] The Uniate Church, important in the Belarusian part of the former Grand Duchy, was incorporated into the Orthodox Church in 1839.[128]

The Polish poetry of Adam Mickiewicz, who was emotionally attached to the Lithuanian countryside and associated medieval legends, influenced ideological foundations of the emerging Lithuanian national movement. Simonas Daukantas, who studied with Mickiewicz at Vilnius University, promoted a return to Lithuania's pre-Commonwealth traditions and a renewal of the local culture, based on the Lithuanian language. With those ideas in mind, he wrote already in 1822 a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian (though still not yet published at that time). Teodor Narbutt wrote in Polish a voluminous Ancient History of the Lithuanian Nation (1835–1841), where he likewise expounded and expanded further on the concept of historic Lithuania, whose days of glory had ended with the Union of Lublin in 1569. Narbutt, invoking the German scholarship, pointed out the relationship between the Lithuanian and Sanskrit languages. It indicated the closeness of Lithuanian to its ancient Indo-European roots and would later provide the ""antiquity"" argument for activists associated with the Lithuanian National Revival. By the middle of the 19th century, the basic ideology of the future Lithuanian nationalist movement was defined with linguistic identity in mind; in order to establish a modern Lithuanian identity, it required a break with the traditional dependence on Polish culture and language.[129]

Around the time of the January Uprising, there was a generation of Lithuanian leaders of the transitional period between a political movement bound with Poland and the modern Lithuanian nationalist movement based on language. Jakób Gieysztor, Konstanty Kalinowski and Antanas Mackevičius wanted to form alliances with the local peasants, who, empowered and given land, would presumably help defeat the Russian Empire, acting in their own self-interest. This created new dilemmas that had to do with languages used for such inter-class communication and later led to the concept of a nation as the ""sum of speakers of a vernacular tongue.""[130]

The failure of the January Uprising in 1864 made the connection with Poland seem outdated to many Lithuanians and at the same time led to the creation of a class of emancipated and often prosperous peasants who, unlike often Polonized urban residents, were effectively custodians of the Lithuanian language. Educational opportunities, now more widely available to young people of such common origins, were one of the crucial factors responsible for the Lithuanian national revival. As schools were being de-Polonized and Lithuanian university students sent to Saint Petersburg or Moscow rather than Warsaw, a cultural void resulted, and it was not being successfully filled by the attempted Russification policies.[131]

Russian nationalists regarded the territories of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an East Slavic realm that ought to be (and was being) ""reunited"" with Russia.[132] In the following decades however, a Lithuanian national movement emerged, composed of activists of different social backgrounds and persuasions, often primarily Polish-speaking, but united by their willingness to promote the Lithuanian culture and language as a strategy for building a modern nation.[131] The restoration of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was no longer the objective of this movement, and the territorial ambitions of its leaders were limited to the lands they considered historically Lithuanian.[112]

In 1864, the Lithuanian language and the Latin alphabet were banned in junior schools. The prohibition on printing in the Lithuanian language reflected the Russian nationalist policy of ""restoration"" of the supposedly Russian beginnings of Lithuania. The tsarist authorities implemented a number of Russification policies, including a Lithuanian press ban and the closing of cultural and educational institutions. Those were resisted by Lithuanians, led by Bishop Motiejus Valančius, among others.[112] Lithuanians resisted by arranging printing abroad and smuggling of the books in from neighboring East Prussia.

Lithuanian was not considered a prestigious language. There were even expectations that the language would become extinct, as more and more territories in the east were slavicized, and more people used Polish or Russian in daily life. The only place where Lithuanian was considered more prestigious and worthy of books and studying was in East Prussia, sometimes referred to by Lithuanian nationalists as ""Lithuania Minor."" At the time, northeastern East Prussia was home to numerous ethnic Lithuanians, but even there Germanization pressure threatened their cultural identity.

The language revival spread into more affluent strata, beginning with the release of the Lithuanian newspapers Aušra and Varpas, then with the writing of poems and books in Lithuanian many of which glorified the historic Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The two most prominent figures in the revival movement, Jonas Basanavičius and Vincas Kudirka, both originated from affluent Lithuanian peasantry and attended the Mariampol Gymnasium (secondary school) in the Suwałki Governorate. The school was a Polish educational center, Russified after the January Uprising, with Lithuanian language classes introduced at that time.[133]

Basanavičius studied medicine at the Moscow State University, where he developed international connections, published (in Polish) on Lithuanian history and graduated in 1879. From there he went to Bulgaria, and in 1882 moved to Prague. In Prague he met and became influenced by the Czech National Revival movement. In 1883, Basanavičius began working on a Lithuanian language review, which assumed the form of a newspaper named Aušra (The Dawn), published in Ragnit, Prussia, Germany (now Neman, Russia). Aušra was printed in Latin characters banned under Russian law, which mandated the Cyrillic alphabet for printing Lithuanian. It was smuggled to Lithuania, together with other Lithuanian publications and books printed in East Prussia. The paper (forty issues in total), building on the work of the earlier writers, sought to demonstrate continuities with the medieval Grand Duchy and lionize the Lithuanian people.[134]

Russian restrictions at Marijampolė secondary school were eased in 1872 and Kudirka learned Polish there. He went on to study at the University of Warsaw, where he was influenced by Polish socialists. In 1889, Kudirka returned to Lithuania and worked on incorporating the Lithuanian peasantry into mainstream politics as the main building block of a modern nation. In 1898, he wrote a poem inspired by the opening strophe of Mickiewicz's epic poem Pan Tadeusz: ""Lithuania, my fatherland! You are like health."" The poem became the national anthem of Lithuania, Tautiška giesmė: (""Lithuania, Our Homeland"").[135]

As the revival grew, Russian policy became harsher. Attacks took place against Catholic churches while the ban forbidding the Lithuanian press continued. However, in the late 19th century, the language ban was lifted.[33] and some 2,500 books were published in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet. The majority of these were published in Tilsit, Kingdom of Prussia (now Russian Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast), although some publications reached Lithuania from the United States. A largely standardized written language was achieved by 1900, based on historical and Aukštaitijan (highland) usages.[136] The letters -č-, -š- and -v- were taken from the modern (redesigned) Czech orthography, to avoid the Polish usage for corresponding sounds.[137][138] The widely accepted Lithuanian Grammar, by Jonas Jablonskis, appeared in 1901.[137]

Large numbers of Lithuanians had emigrated to the United States in 1867–1868 after a famine in Lithuania.[139] Between 1868 and 1914, approximately 635,000 people, almost 20 percent of the population, left Lithuania.[140] Lithuanian cities and towns were growing under the Russian rule, but the country remained underdeveloped by the European standards and job opportunities were limited; many Lithuanians left also for the industrial centers of the Russian Empire, such as Riga and Saint Petersburg. Many of Lithuania's cities were dominated by non-Lithuanian-speaking Jews and Poles.[112]

Lithuania's nationalist movement continued to grow. During the 1905 Russian Revolution, a large congress of Lithuanian representatives in Vilnius known as the Great Seimas of Vilnius demanded provincial autonomy for Lithuania (by which they meant the northwestern portion of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania)[141] on 5 December of that year. The tsarist regime made a number of concessions as the result of the 1905 uprising. The Baltic states once again were permitted to use their native languages in schooling and public discourse, and Catholic churches were built in Lithuania.[112] Latin characters replaced the Cyrillic alphabet that had been forced upon Lithuanians for four decades. But not even Russian liberals were prepared to concede autonomy similar to that that had already existed in Estonia and Latvia, albeit under Baltic German hegemony. Many Baltic Germans looked toward aligning the Baltics (Lithuania and Courland in particular) with Germany.[142]

After the Russian entry into World War I, the German Empire occupied Lithuania and Courland in 1915. Vilnius fell to the Imperial German Army on 19 September 1915. An alliance with Germany in opposition to both tsarist Russia and Lithuanian nationalism became for the Baltic Germans a real possibility.[142] Lithuania was incorporated into Ober Ost under a German government of occupation.[143] As open annexation could result in a public-relations backlash, the Germans planned to form a network of formally independent states that would in fact be dependent on Germany.[144]

The German occupation government permitted a Vilnius Conference to convene between 18 and 22 September 1917, with the demand that Lithuanians declare loyalty to Germany and agree to an annexation. The intent of the conferees was to begin the process of establishing a Lithuanian state based on ethnic identity and language that would be independent of the Russian Empire, Poland, and the German Empire. The mechanism for this process was to be decided by a constituent assembly, but the German government would not permit elections. Furthermore, the publication of the conference's resolution calling for the creation of a Lithuanian state and elections for a constituent assembly was not allowed.[145] The Conference nonetheless elected a 20-member Council of Lithuania (Taryba) and empowered it to act as the executive authority of the Lithuanian people.[144] The Council, led by Jonas Basanavičius, declared Lithuanian independence as a German protectorate on 11 December 1917, and then adopted the outright Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918.[13] It proclaimed Lithuania as an independent republic, organized according to democratic principles.[146] The Germans, weakened by the losses on the Western Front, but still present in the country,[112] did not support such a declaration and hindered attempts to establish actual independence. To prevent being incorporated into the German Empire, Lithuanians elected Monaco-born King Mindaugas II as the titular monarch of the Kingdom of Lithuania in July 1918. Mindaugas II never assumed the throne, however.

In the meantime, an attempt to revive the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a socialist multi-national federal republic was also taking place under the German occupation. In March 1918, Anton Luckievich and his Belarusian National Council proclaimed a Belarusian People's Republic that was to include Vilnius. Luckievich and the Council fled the Red Army approaching from Russia and left Minsk before it was taken over by the Bolsheviks in December 1918. Upon their arrival in Vilnius, they proposed a Belarusian-Lithuanian federation, which however generated no interest on the part of the Lithuanian leaders, who were in advanced stages of promoting national plans of their own. The Lithuanians were mostly interested only in a state ""within ethnographic frontiers,"" as they perceived it.[147]

Nevertheless, a Belarusian unit named 1st Belarusian Regiment (Pirmasis baltgudžių pėstininkų pulkas), commanded by Alaksandar Ružancoŭ, was formed mainly from Grodno's inhabitants in 1919 within the Lithuanian Armed Forces, which later also participated in supporting the Independence of Lithuania during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, therefore many members of this unit were awarded with the highest state award of Lithuania – Order of the Cross of Vytis.[148][149] Moreover, a Lithuanian Ministry for Belarusian Affairs (Gudų reikalų ministerija) was established within the Government of Lithuania, which functioned in 1918–1924, and was led by the ethnic Belarusian ministers such as Jazep Varonka, Dominik Semashko.[148] The ethnic Belarusians were also included into the Council of Lithuania,[150] and the Belarusian political leaders initially requested for a political autonomy of the Belarusian lands with the Belarusian language as the official language in them within the restored Lithuania before losing all control over the Belarusian territories to the Poles and Soviets.[151]

In spite of its success in knocking Russia out of World War I by the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk early in 1918, Germany lost the war and signed the Armistice of Compiègne on 11 November 1918. Lithuanians quickly formed their first government, adopted a provisional constitution, and started organizing basic administrative structures. The prime minister of the new government was Augustinas Voldemaras. As the German army was withdrawing from the Eastern Front of World War I, it was followed by Soviet forces whose intention was to spread the global proletarian revolution.[146] They created a number of puppet states, including the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic on 16 December 1918. By the end of December, the Red Army reached Lithuanian borders and started the Lithuanian–Soviet War.

On 1 January 1919, the German occupying army withdrew from Vilnius and turned the city over to local Polish self-defense forces. The Lithuanian government evacuated Vilnius and moved west to Kaunas, which became the temporary capital of Lithuania. Vilnius was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 5 January 1919. As the Lithuanian army was in its infant stages, the Soviet forces moved largely unopposed and by mid-January 1919 controlled about two-thirds of Lithuanian territory. Vilnius was now the capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Republic, and soon of the combined Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[152]

From April 1919, the Lithuanian–Soviet War dragged on parallel with the Polish–Soviet War. Polish troops captured Vilnius from the Soviets on 21 April 1919.[153] Poland had territorial claims over Lithuania, especially the Vilnius Region, and these tensions spilled over into the Polish–Lithuanian War. Józef Piłsudski of Poland,[d] seeking a Polish-Lithuanian federation, but unable to find common ground with Lithuanian politicians, in August 1919 made an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Lithuanian government in Kaunas.[155] According to a 1924 publication of Lithuanian President Antanas Smetona, following a successful recapture of the Lithuanian capital Vilnius from Poland, the Lithuanians planned to expand further into the Belarusian territories (the former lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and considered granting an autonomy to the Belarusian territories, as requested by the Belarusian side, therefore had kept the Lithuanian Ministry for Belarusian Affairs in force, moreover, Smetona noted that there were a lot of pro-Lithuanian sympathies among the Belarusians.[156][157]

The Belarusian unit of the Lithuanian Armed Forces in Grodno was disbanded by the Poles following the annexation of it by the Polish Armed Forces in April 1919, while the soldiers of this unit were disarmed, looted, and publicly humiliated by the Polish soldiers, who even ripped off the Belarusian officers insignias from their uniforms and trampled these symbols with their feet in public, as documented in the historical documents sent by the Belarusians to the temporary Lithuanian capital Kaunas because this unit refused to carry out the Polish orders and stayed loyal to Lithuania.[158][159] Following the annexation of Grodno, the Lithuanian yellow–green–red, Belarusian white–red–white flags, and signs with the Coat of arms of Lithuania were torn off and the Polish gendarmes dragged them on the dusty streets for ridicule; instead of them, the Polish signs and flags were raised in their place everywhere in the city.[158][160] Soldiers and Catholic officers of the Belarusian regiment in Grodno were offered to join the Polish Army, while those who refused were offered to leave or were arrested, put into the concentration camps or deported from the native land by the Poles, part of the Belarusian soldiers and officers of this regiment evacuated to Kaunas and continued serving for Lithuania.[158][161][162]

The Lithuanian Army, commanded by General Silvestras Žukauskas, withstood Red Army advance near Kėdainiai and in the spring of 1919 the Lithuanians recaptured Šiauliai, Radviliškis, Panevėžys, Ukmergė.[163] By the end of August 1919, the Soviets were pushed out of Lithuanian territory and the Lithuanian units reached Daugava.[163] The Lithuanian Army was then deployed against the paramilitary West Russian Volunteer Army (Bermontians), who invaded northern Lithuania.[163] There were around 50,000 of Bermontians and they were well armed by Germany and supported German and Russian soldiers who sought to retain German control over the former Ober Ost.[163] West Russian Volunteers were defeated and pushed out by the end of 1919.[163] Thus the first phase of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence was over and Lithuanians could direct attention to internal affairs.[163]

The Constituent Assembly of Lithuania was elected in April 1920 and first met the following May. In June it adopted the third provisional constitution and on 12 July 1920, signed the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. In the treaty the Soviet Union recognized fully independent Lithuania and its claims to the disputed Vilnius Region; Lithuania secretly allowed the Soviet forces passage through its territory as they moved against Poland.[164] On 14 July 1920, the advancing Soviet army captured Vilnius for a second time from Polish forces. The city was handed back to Lithuanians on 26 August 1920, following the defeat of the Soviet offensive. The victorious Polish army returned and the Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty increased hostilities between Poland and Lithuania. To prevent further fighting, the Suwałki Agreement was signed with Poland on 7 October 1920; it left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side of the armistice line.[165] It never went into effect, however, because Polish General Lucjan Żeligowski, acting on Józef Piłsudski's orders, staged the Żeligowski's Mutiny, a military action presented as a mutiny.[165] He invaded Lithuania on 8 October 1920, captured Vilnius the following day, and established a short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania in eastern Lithuania on 12 October 1920. The republic was a part of Piłsudski's federalist scheme, which never materialized due to opposition from both Polish and Lithuanian nationalists.[165]

For 19 years, Kaunas was the temporary capital of Lithuania while the Vilnius region remained under Polish administration. The League of Nations attempted to mediate the dispute, and Paul Hymans proposed plans for a Polish–Lithuanian union, but negotiations broke down as neither side could agree to a compromise. Central Lithuania held a general election in 1922 that was boycotted by the Jews, Lithuanians and Belarusians, then was annexed into Poland on 24 March 1922.[166] The Conference of Ambassadors awarded Vilnius to Poland in March 1923.[167] Lithuania did not accept this decision and broke all relations with Poland. The two countries were officially at war over Vilnius, the historical capital of Lithuania, inhabited at that time largely by Polish-speaking and Jewish populations between 1920 and 1938.[168][169] The dispute continued to dominate Lithuanian domestic politics and foreign policy and doomed the relations with Poland for the entire interwar period.[169]

For administrative purposes, the de facto territory of the country was divided into 23 counties (lt:apskritis). A further 11 counties (including Vilnius) were allocated for the territory occupied by Poland (see also Administrative divisions of Lithuania).

The Constituent Assembly, which adjourned in October 1920 due to threats from Poland, gathered again and initiated many reforms needed in the new state. Lithuania obtained international recognition and membership in the League of Nations,[e] passed a law for land reform, introduced a national currency (the litas), and adopted a final constitution in August 1922. Lithuania became a democratic state, with Seimas (parliament) elected by men and women for a three-year term. The Seimas elected the president. The First Seimas of Lithuania was elected in October 1922, but could not form a government as the votes split equally 38–38, and it was forced to dissolve. Its only lasting achievement was the Klaipėda Revolt from 10 January to 15 January 1923. The revolt involved Lithuania Minor, a region traditionally sought by Lithuanian nationalists[126] that remained under German rule after World War I, except for the Klaipėda Region with its large Lithuanian minority.[170] (Various sources give the region's interwar ethnic composition as 41.9 percent German, 27.1 percent Memelländisch, and 26.6 percent Lithuanian.)[171][172]

Lithuania took advantage of the Ruhr Crisis in western Europe and captured the Klaipėda Region, a territory detached from East Prussia by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and placed under a French administration sponsored by the League of Nations. The region was incorporated as an autonomous district of Lithuania in May 1924. For Lithuania, it provided the country's only access to the Baltic Sea, and it was an important industrial center, but the region's numerous German inhabitants resisted Lithuanian rule during the 1930s. The Klaipėda Revolt was the last armed conflict in Lithuania before World War II.[112]

The Second Seimas of Lithuania, elected in May 1923, was the only Seimas in independent Lithuania that served its full term. The Seimas continued the land reform, introduced social support systems, and started repaying foreign debt. The first Lithuanian national census took place in 1923.

The Third Seimas of Lithuania was elected in May 1926. For the first time, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party lost their majority and went into opposition. It was sharply criticized for signing the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact (even though it affirmed Soviet recognition of Lithuanian claims to Poland-held Vilnius)[169] and was accused of ""Bolshevizing"" Lithuania. As a result of growing tensions, the government was deposed during the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état in December. The coup, organized by the military, was supported by the Lithuanian Nationalists Union (tautininkai) and Lithuanian Christian Democrats. They installed Antanas Smetona as the president and Augustinas Voldemaras as the prime minister.[173] Smetona suppressed the opposition and remained as an authoritarian leader until June 1940.

The Seimas thought that the coup was just a temporary measure and that new elections would be called to return Lithuania to democracy. Instead, the legislative body was dissolved in May 1927. Later that year members of the Social Democrats and other leftist parties tried to organize an uprising against Smetona, but were quickly subdued. Voldemaras grew increasingly independent of Smetona and was forced to resign in 1929. Three times in 1930 and once in 1934, he unsuccessfully attempted to return to power. In May 1928, Smetona announced the fifth provisional constitution without consulting the Seimas. The constitution continued to claim that Lithuania was a democratic state while the powers of the president were vastly increased. Smetona's party, the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, steadily grew in size and importance. He adopted the title ""tautos vadas"" (leader of the nation) and slowly started building a cult of personality. Many prominent political figures married into Smetona's family (for example, Juozas Tūbelis and Stasys Raštikis).

When the Nazi Party came into power in Germany, German–Lithuanian relations worsened considerably as the Nazis did not want to accept the loss of the Klaipėda Region (German: Memelland). The Nazis sponsored anti-Lithuanian organizations in the region. In 1934, Lithuania put the activists on trial and sentenced about 100 people, including their leaders Ernst Neumann and Theodor von Sass, to prison terms. That prompted Germany, one of the main trade partners of Lithuania, to declare an embargo of Lithuanian products. In response, Lithuania shifted its exports to the United Kingdom. That measure did not go far enough to satisfy many groups, and peasants in Suvalkija organized strikes, which were violently suppressed. Smetona's prestige was damaged, and in September 1936, he agreed to call the first elections for the Seimas since the coup of 1926. Before the elections, all political parties were eliminated except for the National Union. Thus 42 of the 49 members of the Fourth Seimas of Lithuania were from the National Union. This assembly functioned as an advisory board to the president, and in February 1938, it adopted a new constitution that granted the president even greater powers.

As tensions were rising in Europe following the annexation of the Federal State of Austria by Nazi Germany (the Anschluss), Poland presented the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania in March of that year. Poland demanded the re-establishment of the normal diplomatic relations that were broken after the Żeligowski Mutiny in 1920 and threatened military actions in case of refusal. Lithuania, having a weaker military and unable to enlist international support for its cause, accepted the ultimatum.[169] In the event of Polish military action, Adolf Hitler ordered a German military takeover of southwest Lithuania up to the Dubysa River, and his armed forces were being fully mobilized until the news of the Lithuanian acceptance. Relations between Poland and Lithuania became somewhat normalized after the acceptance of the ultimatum, and the parties concluded treaties regarding railway transport, postal exchange, and other means of communication.[174]

Lithuania offered diplomatic support to Germany and the Soviet Union in opposition to powers such as France and Estonia that backed Poland in the conflict over Vilnius, but both Germany and the Soviet Union saw fit to encroach on Lithuania's territory and independence anyway. Following the Nazi electoral success in Klaipėda in December 1938, Germany decided to take action to secure control of the entire region. On 20 March 1939, just a few days after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia of 15 March, Lithuania received the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania from foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. It demanded the immediate cession of the Klaipėda Region to Germany. The Lithuanian government accepted the ultimatum to avoid an armed intervention. The Klaipėda Region was directly incorporated into the Gau East Prussia of the German Reich.[175] This triggered a political crisis in Lithuania and forced Smetona to form a new government that included members of the opposition for the first time since 1926. The loss of Klaipėda was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy and the country shifted into the sphere of German influence.

Adolf Hitler initially planned to transform Lithuania into a satellite state which would participate in its planned military conquests in exchange for territorial enlargements.[176] When Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939 and divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence, Lithuania was assigned to Germany at first, but that changed after Smetona's refusal to participate in the German invasion of Poland.[112][177] Joseph Stalin agreed to cede Polish areas initially annexed by the Soviet Union to the Greater Germanic Reich in exchange for Lithuania entering the Soviet sphere of influence.[176]

The interwar period of independence gave birth to the development of Lithuanian press, literature, music, arts, and theater as well as a comprehensive system of education with Lithuanian as the language of instruction. The network of primary and secondary schools was expanded and institutions of higher learning were established in Kaunas.[33] Lithuanian society remained heavily agricultural with only 20% of the people living in cities. The influence of the Catholic Church was strong and birth rates high: the population increased by 22% to over three million during 1923–1939, despite emigration to South America and elsewhere.[112]
In almost all cities and towns, traditionally dominated by Jews, Poles, Russians and Germans, ethnic Lithuanians became the majority. Lithuanians, for example, constituted 59% of the residents of Kaunas in 1923, as opposed to 7% in 1897.[178] The right-wing dictatorship of 1926–1940 had strangely stabilizing social effects, as it prevented the worst of antisemitic excesses as well as the rise of leftist and rightist political extremism.[178]

Secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, adjusted by the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty, divided Eastern Europe into Soviet and Nazi spheres of influence. The three Baltic states fell to the Soviet sphere.[177] During the subsequent invasion of Poland, the Red Army captured Vilnius, regarded by Lithuanians as their capital. According to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Pact of 10 October 1939, Soviet Union transferred Vilnius and surrounding territory to Lithuania in exchange for the stationing of 20,000 Soviet troops within the country.[179] It was a virtual sacrifice of independence, as reflected in a known slogan ""Vilnius – mūsų, Lietuva – rusų"" (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's). Similar Mutual Assistance Pacts were signed with Latvia and Estonia. When Finland refused to sign its pact, the Winter War broke out.

In spring 1940, once the Winter War in Finland was over, the Soviets heightened their diplomatic pressure on Lithuania and issued the 1940 Soviet ultimatum to Lithuania on June 14.[179] The ultimatum demanded the formation of a new pro-Soviet government and admission of an unspecified number of Red Army troops. With Soviet troops already stationed within the country, Lithuania could not resist and accepted the ultimatum. President Antanas Smetona fled Lithuania as 150,000 Soviet troops crossed the Lithuanian border.[179][180] Soviet representative Vladimir Dekanozov formed the new pro-Soviet puppet government, known as the People's Government, headed by Justas Paleckis, and organized show elections for the so-called People's Seimas. During its first session on July 21, the People's Seimas unanimously voted to convert Lithuania into the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and petitioned to join the Soviet Union. The application was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on 3 August 1940, which completed the formalization of the annexation.[179]

Immediately following the occupation, Soviet authorities began rapid Sovietization of Lithuania. All land was nationalized. To gain support for the new regime among the poorer peasants, large farms were distributed to small landowners. However, in preparation for eventual collectivization, agricultural taxes were dramatically increased in an attempt to bankrupt all farmers. Nationalization of banks, larger enterprises, and real estate resulted in disruptions in production that caused massive shortages of goods. The Lithuanian litas was artificially undervalued and withdrawn by spring 1941. Standards of living plummeted. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were banned, leaving only the Communist Party of Lithuania and its youth branch. An estimated 12,000 ""enemies of the people"" were arrested. During the June deportation campaign of 1941, some 12,600 people (mostly former military officers, policemen, political figures, intelligentsia and their families) were deported[181] to Gulags in Siberia under the policy of elimination of national elites. Many deportees perished due to inhumane conditions; 3,600 were imprisoned and over 1,000 were killed.[33]

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.[180] In Franz Walter Stahlecker's report of October 15 to Heinrich Himmler, Stahlecker wrote that he had succeeded in covering up actions of the Vorkommando (German vanguard unit) and made it look like an initiative of the local population to carry out the Kaunas pogrom.[182] The German forces moved rapidly and encountered only sporadic Soviet resistance. Vilnius was captured on 24 June 1941,[183] and Germany controlled all of Lithuania within a week. The retreating Soviet forces murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 people, mostly ethnic Lithuanians[178] (see Rainiai massacre). The Lithuanians generally greeted the Germans as liberators from the oppressive Soviet regime and hoped that Germany would restore some autonomy to their country.[184] The Lithuanian Activist Front organized an anti-Soviet revolt known as the June Uprising in Lithuania, declared independence, and formed a Provisional Government of Lithuania with Juozas Ambrazevičius as prime minister. The Provisional Government was not forcibly dissolved; stripped by the Germans of any actual power, it resigned on 5 August 1941.[185] Germany established the civil administration known as the Reichskommissariat Ostland.[112]

Initially, there was substantial cooperation and collaboration between the German forces and some Lithuanians. Lithuanians joined the TDA Battalions and Auxiliary police battalions in hopes that these police units would be later transformed into the regular army of independent Lithuania. Instead, some units were employed by the Germans as auxiliaries in perpetrating the Holocaust.[184] However, soon Lithuanians became disillusioned with harsh German policies of collecting large war provisions, gathering people for forced labor in Germany, conscripting men into the Wehrmacht, and the lack of true autonomy. These feelings naturally led to the creation of a resistance movement.[178] The most notable resistance organization, the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, was formed in 1943. Due to passive resistance, a Waffen-SS division was not established in Lithuania. As a compromise, the Lithuanian general Povilas Plechavičius formed the short-lived Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (LTDF). Lithuanians did not organize armed resistance, still considering the Soviet Union their primary enemy. Armed resistance was conducted by pro-Soviet partisans (mainly Russians, Belarusians and Jews)[184] and Polish Armia Krajowa (AK) in eastern Lithuania.

Before the Holocaust, Lithuania was home to a disputed number of Jews: 210,000 according to one estimate,[186] 250,000 according to another.[187] About 90% or more of the Lithuanian Jews were murdered,[184] one of the highest rates in Europe. The Holocaust in Lithuania can be divided into three stages: mass executions (June–December 1941), a ghetto period (1942 – March 1943), and a final liquidation (April 1943 – July 1944). Unlike in other Nazi-occupied countries where the Holocaust was introduced gradually, Einsatzgruppe A started executions in Lithuania on the first days of the German occupation.[183] The executions were carried out by the Nazis and their Lithuanian collaborators[188] in three main areas: Kaunas (marked by the Ninth Fort), in Vilnius (marked by the Ponary massacre), and in the countryside (sponsored by the Rollkommando Hamann). An estimated 80% of Lithuanian Jews were killed before 1942.[189] The surviving 43,000 Jews were concentrated in the Vilnius Ghetto, Kaunas Ghetto, Šiauliai Ghetto, and Švenčionys Ghetto and forced to work for the benefit of German military industry.[190] In 1943, the ghettos were either liquidated or turned into concentration camps. Only about 2,000–3,000 Lithuanian Jews were liberated from these camps.[191] More survived by withdrawing into the interior of Russia before the war broke out or by escaping the ghettos and joining the Jewish partisans.

In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army reached eastern Lithuania.[180] By July 1944, the area around Vilnius came under control of the Polish Resistance fighters of the Armia Krajowa, who also attempted a takeover of the German-held city during the ill-fated Operation Ostra Brama.[192] The Red Army captured Vilnius with Polish help on 13 July.[192] The Soviet Union re-occupied Lithuania and Joseph Stalin re-established the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1944 with its capital in Vilnius.[192] The Soviets secured the passive agreement of the United States and Great Britain (see Yalta Conference and Potsdam Agreement) to this annexation. By January 1945, the Soviet forces captured Klaipėda on the Baltic coast. The heaviest physical losses in Lithuania during World War II were suffered in 1944–1945, when the Red Army pushed out the Nazi invaders.[178] It is estimated that Lithuania lost 780,000 people between 1940 and 1954 under the Nazi and Soviet occupations.[33]

The Soviet deportations from Lithuania between 1941 and 1952 resulted in the exile of thousands of families to forced settlements in the Soviet Union, especially in Siberia and other remote parts of the country. Between 1944 and 1953, nearly 120,000 people (5% of the population) were deported,[178] and thousands more became political prisoners. Many leading intellectual figures and most Catholic priests were among the deported; many returned to Lithuania after 1953. Approximately 20,000 Lithuanian partisans participated in unsuccessful warfare against the Soviet regime in the 1940s and early 1950s. Most were killed or deported to Siberian gulags.[193][f] During the years following the German surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, between 40 and 60 thousand civilians and combatants perished in the context of the anti-Soviet insurgency. Considerably more ethnic Lithuanians died after World War II than during it.[178][195]

Lithuanian armed resistance lasted until 1953. Adolfas Ramanauskas (code name 'Vanagas', translated to English: the hawk), the last official commander of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters, was arrested in October 1956 and executed in November 1957.

Soviet authorities encouraged the immigration of non-Lithuanian workers, especially Russians, as a way of integrating Lithuania into the Soviet Union and encouraging industrial development,[33] but in Lithuania this process did not assume the massive scale experienced by other European Soviet republics.[196]

To a great extent, Lithuanization rather than Russification took place in postwar Vilnius and elements of a national revival characterize the period of Lithuania's existence as a Soviet republic.[180][g] Lithuania's boundaries and political integrity were determined by Joseph Stalin's decision to grant Vilnius to the Lithuanian SSR again in 1944. Subsequently, most Poles were resettled from Vilnius (but only a minority from the countryside and other parts of the Lithuanian SSR)[h] by the implementation of Soviet and Lithuanian communist policies that mandated their partial replacement by Russian immigrants. Vilnius was then increasingly settled by Lithuanians and assimilated by Lithuanian culture, which fulfilled, albeit under the oppressive and limiting conditions of the Soviet rule, the long-held dream of Lithuanian nationalists.[199] The economy of Lithuania did well in comparison with other regions of the Soviet Union.[112]

The national developments in Lithuania followed tacit compromise agreements worked out by the Soviet communists, Lithuanian communists and the Lithuanian intelligentsia. Vilnius University was reopened after the war, operating in the Lithuanian language and with a largely Lithuanian student body. It became a center for Baltic studies. General schools in the Lithuanian SSR provided more instruction in Lithuanian than at any previous time in the country's history. The literary Lithuanian language was standardized and refined further as a language of scholarship and Lithuanian literature. The price the Lithuanian intelligentsia ended up paying for the national privileges was their much increased Communist Party membership after de-Stalinization.[200]

Between the death of Stalin in 1953 and the glasnost and perestroika reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev in the mid-1980s, Lithuania functioned as a Soviet society, with all its repressions and peculiarities. Agriculture remained collectivized, property nationalized, and criticism of the Soviet system was severely punished. The country remained largely isolated from the non-Soviet world because of travel restrictions, the persecution of the Catholic Church continued and the nominally egalitarian society was extensively corrupted by the practice of connections and privileges for those who served the system.[112]

The communist era is represented in the museum of Grūtas Park.

Until mid-1988, all political, economic, and cultural life was controlled by the Communist Party of Lithuania (CPL). Lithuanians as well as people in the other two Baltic republics distrusted the Soviet regime even more than people in other regions of the Soviet state, and they gave their own specific and active support to Mikhail Gorbachev's program of social and political reforms known as perestroika and glasnost. Under the leadership of intellectuals, the Reform Movement of Lithuania Sąjūdis was formed in mid-1988, and it declared a program of democratic and national rights, winning nationwide popularity. Inspired by Sąjūdis, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR passed constitutional amendments on the supremacy of Lithuanian laws over Soviet legislation, annulled the 1940 decisions on proclaiming Lithuania a part of the Soviet Union, legalized a multi-party system, and adopted a number of other important decisions, including the return of the national state symbols — the flag of Lithuania and the national anthem. A large number of CPL members also supported the ideas of Sąjūdis, and with Sąjūdis support, Algirdas Brazauskas was elected First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPL in 1988. On 23 August 1989, 50 years after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians joined hands in a human chain that stretched 600 kilometres from Tallinn to Vilnius in order to draw the world's attention to the fate of the Baltic nations. The human chain was called the Baltic Way. In December 1989, the Brazauskas-led CPL declared its independence from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and became a separate social democratic party, renaming itself the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania in 1990.

In early 1990, candidates backed by Sąjūdis won the Lithuanian parliamentary elections.[201] On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR proclaimed the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania. The Baltic republics were in the forefront of the struggle for independence, and Lithuania was the first of the Soviet republics to declare independence. Vytautas Landsbergis, a leader of the Sąjūdis national movement,[202] became the head of state and Kazimira Prunskienė led the Cabinet of Ministers. Provisional fundamental laws of the state were passed.[33]

On 15 March, the Soviet Union demanded revocation of the independence and began employing political and economic sanctions against Lithuania. On 18 April, Soviets imposed economic blockade of Lithuania which lasted until the end of June. The Soviet military was used to seize a few public buildings, but violence was largely contained until January 1991. During the January Events in Lithuania, the Soviet authorities attempted to overthrow the elected government by sponsoring the so-called National Salvation Committee. The Soviets forcibly took over the Vilnius TV Tower, killing 14 unarmed civilians and injuring 140.[203] During this assault, the only means of contact to the outside world available was an amateur radio station set up in the Lithuanian Parliament building by Tadas Vyšniauskas whose call sign was LY2BAW.[204] The initial cries for help were received by an American amateur radio operators with the call sign N9RD in Indiana and WB9Z in Illinois.[citation needed] N9RD, WB9Z and other radio operators from around the world were able to relay situational updates to relevant authorities until official United States Department of State personnel were able to go on-air. Moscow failed to act further to crush the Lithuanian independence movement, and the Lithuanian government continued to function.

During the national referendum on 9 February 1991, more than 90% of those who took part in the voting (84.73% of all eligible voters) voted in favor of an independent, democratic Lithuania. During the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt in August, Soviet Armed Forces troops took over several communications and other government facilities in Vilnius and other cities, but returned to their barracks when the coup failed. The Lithuanian government banned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and ordered confiscation of its property. Following the failed coup, Lithuania received widespread international recognition on 6 September 1991 and was admitted to the United Nations on 17 September.[33]

As in many countries of the former Soviet Union, the popularity of the independence movement (Sąjūdis in the case of Lithuania) diminished due to worsening economic situation (rising unemployment, inflation, etc.). The Communist Party of Lithuania renamed itself as the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP) and gained a majority of seats against Sąjūdis in the Lithuanian parliamentary elections of 1992.[205] LDDP continued building the independent democratic state and transitioning from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy. In the Lithuanian parliamentary elections of 1996, the voters swung back to the rightist Homeland Union, led by the former Sąjūdis leader Vytautas Landsbergis.[206]

As part of the economic transition to capitalism, Lithuania organized a privatization campaign to sell government-owned residential real estate and commercial enterprises. The government issued investment vouchers to be used in privatization instead of actual currency. People cooperated in groups to collect larger amounts of vouchers for the public auctions and the privatization campaign. Lithuania, unlike Russia, did not create a small group of very wealthy and powerful people. The privatization started with small organizations, and large enterprises (such as telecommunication companies or airlines) were sold several years later for hard currency in a bid to attract foreign investors. Lithuania's monetary system was to be based on the Lithuanian litas, the currency used during the interwar period. Due to high inflation and other delays, a temporary currency, the Lithuanian talonas, was introduced (it was commonly referred to as the Vagnorėlis or Vagnorkė after Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius). Eventually the litas was issued in June 1993, and the decision was made to set it up with a fixed exchange rate to the United States dollar in 1994 and to the Euro in 2002.

Despite Lithuania's achievement of complete independence, sizable numbers of Russian Armed Forces troops remained in its territory. Withdrawal of those forces was one of Lithuania's top foreign policy priorities. Russian troop withdrawal was completed by 31 August 1993.[33] The first military of the reborn country were the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces, who first took an oath at the Supreme Council of Lithuania soon after the declaration of independence. The Lithuanian military built itself to the common standard with the Lithuanian Air Force, Lithuanian Naval Force and Lithuanian Land Force. Interwar paramilitary organisations such as the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, Young Riflemen, and the Lithuanian Scouts were re-established.

On 27 April 1993, a partnership with the Pennsylvania National Guard was established as part of the State Partnership Program.[207]

Seeking closer ties with the West, Lithuania applied for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership in 1994. The country had to go through a difficult transition from planned to free market economy in order to satisfy the requirements for European Union (EU) membership. In May 2001, Lithuania became the 141st member of the World Trade Organization. In October 2002, Lithuania was invited to join the European Union and one month later to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; it became a member of both in 2004.[33]

As a result of the broader 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, the Lithuanian economy in 2009 experienced its worst recession since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. After a boom in growth sparked by Lithuania's 2004 accession to the European Union, the Gross domestic product contracted by 15% in 2009.[33] Especially since Lithuania's admission into the European Union, large numbers of Lithuanians (up to 20% of the population) have moved abroad in search of better economic opportunities to create a significant demographic problem for the small country.[112] On 1 January 2015, Lithuania joined the eurozone and adopted the European Union's single currency as the last of the Baltic states.[208] On 4 July 2018, Lithuania officially joined OECD.[209]

Dalia Grybauskaitė was the first female President of Lithuania (2009–2019) and the first president to be re-elected for a second consecutive term.[210] She was succeeded by Gitanas Nausėda in 2019.[211] On 11–12 July 2023, the NATO summit was held in Vilnius, which was attended by heads of state or government members of NATO countries and its allies.[212]

Krapauskas (2010) identifies three main tendencies in the recent historiography. The ""postmodern school"" is heavily influenced by the French Annales School and presents an entirely new agenda of topics and interdisciplinary research methodologies. Their approach is methodologically controversial and focuses on social and cultural history. It is largely free from the traditional political debates and does not look back to the interwar Šapoka era. Secondly, the ""critical-realists"" are political revisionists. They focus on controversial political topics in the twentieth century, and reverse 180° the Soviet era interpretations of what was good and bad for Lithuania. They use traditional historical methodologies, with a strong focus on political history. They are often opposed by the third school, the ""romantic-traditionalists."" After severe constraints in the communist era, the romantic-traditionalists now are eager to emphasize the most positive version of the Lithuanian past and its cultural heritage. They pay less attention to the niceties of documentation and historiography, but they are not the puppets of political conservatives. Indeed, they include many of Lithuania's most respected historians.[213]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lithuania
History of the Jews in Lithuania,"The history of the Jews in Lithuania spans the period from the 14th century to the present day. There is still a small community in the country, as well as an extensive Lithuanian Jewish diaspora in Israel, the United States, South Africa, and other countries.

The origin of the Jews of Lithuania has been a subject of much speculation. The first reliable document attesting the presence of Jews in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania is the charter of 1388 granting privileges to the Jews in Trakai.[2] The gathering together of the scattered Jewish settlers in sufficient numbers and with enough power to form communities and to obtain privileges from their Lithuanian rulers implies the lapse of considerable time from the first migrations. Therefore, various historians attempted to claim that Jews migrated to Lithuania earlier. For example, Abraham Harkavy (1835–1919) claimed that the first Jews migrated in the 10th century from the Khazar Khaganate (see also Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry).[3] Other historians claim that Jews migrated from Germany in the 12th century. German Jews were persecuted during the era of crusades.[2] The traditional language of the vast majority of Jews of Lithuania, Yiddish, is based largely upon the Medieval German spoken by the western Germanic Jewish immigrants. Another theory is that Jews migrated during the reign of Grand Duke Gediminas (reigned 1316–1341) attracted by his invitation of merchants and craftspeople in 1323–1324 and economic opportunities – at the time, Lithuania had no cities in the western sense of the word, no Magdeburg Rights or closed guilds.[3] In the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into Galicia–Volhynia (see Galicia–Volhynia Wars) and the Principality of Kiev (see Battle on the Irpin River and Battle of Blue Waters), territories already inhabited by Jews.[4]

Duke Vytautas granted privileges to the Jews of Trakai on June 24, 1388.[2] Later similar privileges were granted to the Jews of Brest (July 1, 1388), Grodno (1389), Lutsk, Vladimir, and other large towns. The charter was modeled upon similar documents granted by Casimir III, and earlier by Bolesław of Kalisz, to the Jews in Poland in 1264. Therefore, it seems more than likely that influential Polish Jews cooperated with the leading Lithuanian communities in securing the charters from Vytautas.

Under the charter, the Lithuanian Jews formed a class of freemen subject in all criminal cases directly to the jurisdiction of the grand duke and his official representatives, and in petty suits to the jurisdiction of local officials on an equal footing with the lesser nobles (szlachta), boyars, and other free citizens. The official representatives of the Polish king and the grand duke were the voivode (palatine) in Poland and the elder (starosta) in Lithuania, who were known as the ""Jewish judges"" (judex Judæorum), and their deputies.[5] The Jewish judge decided all cases between Christians and Jews and all criminal suits in which Jews were concerned; in civil suits, however, he acted only on the application of the interested parties. Either party who failed to obey the judge's summons had to pay him a fine. To him also belonged all fines collected from Jews for minor offenses. His duties included the guardianship of the persons, property, and freedom of worship of the Jews. He had no right to summon any one to his court except upon the complaint of an interested party. In matters of religion the Jews were given extensive autonomy.

Under these equitable laws the Jews of Lithuania reached a degree of prosperity unknown to their Polish and German co-religionists at that time. The communities of Brest, Grodno, Trakai, Lutsk, and Minsk rapidly grew in wealth and influence. Every community had at its head a Jewish elder. These elders represented the communities in all external relations, in securing new privileges, and in the regulation of taxes. Such officials are not, however, referred to by the title ""elder"" before the end of the 16th century. Up to that time the documents merely state, for instance, that the ""Jews of Brest humbly apply,"" etc. On assuming office the elders declared under oath that they would discharge the duties of the position faithfully, and would relinquish the office at the expiration of the appointed term. The elder acted in conjunction with the rabbi, whose jurisdiction included all Jewish affairs with the exception of judicial cases assigned to the court of the deputy, and by the latter to the king. In religious affairs, however, an appeal from the decision of the rabbi and the elder was permitted only to a council consisting of the chief rabbis of the king's cities. The cantor, sexton, and shochet were subject to the orders of the rabbi and elder.

The goodwill and tolerance of Vytautas endeared him to his Jewish subjects, and for a long time traditions concerning his generosity and nobility of character were current among them. His cousin, the king of Poland Jogaila, did not interfere with his administration during Vytautas's lifetime.

Vytautas sought the create a middle class of traders and merchants during his reign and for this purpose he preferred Jews over Germans or Poles because he viewed them as more loyal. To help the Jewish community he intervened on their behalf several times so that Jewish traders could travel to places where they were otherwise banned such as Danzig. Vytautas's Tolerance led to a golden age of Judaism in Lithuania with many Jews from Italy, France, Spain, Crimea, Bohemia, and the Holy Roman Empire migrating to Lithuania in search of tolerance and or trade opportunities.[6]

The reign of Vytautas saw the beginnings of the Karaite community in Lithuania. According to Karaite oral histories the first Karaites in Lithuania were several Tatar families captured as prisoners of war by Vytautas and resettled in Lithuania. The Karaite vernacular was Tatar but used Hebrew as a liturgical language and was differentiated from the rest of Jewish community by their distinctive religious practices and culture.[6]

Vytautas referred to the Karaites as ""Jews of Trakai"" (Latin: Judaei Troceuses) and they were considered Jews, but the Karaites themselves insisted they were not Jewish and fought for separate legal autonomy and rights from the Jews. Despite this, the Jewish and Karaite communities of Lithuania had good relation and were very connected physically, legally, and institutionally. They shared religious facilities, several religious texts, and yeshivot. As such the history of the Lithuanian Karaites is inseparable from the history of the Lithuanian Jews.[6]

In 1569, Poland and Lithuania were united (Union of Lublin). It was generally a time of prosperity and relative safety for the Jews of both countries (with the exception of the 17th-century Khmelnytsky Uprising). However, a few events, such as the expulsion of the Jews from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania between 1495 and 1503 occurred just within Lithuania.

By the time of Casimir IV's reign the two Jewish population centers in Lithuania were Trakai and Lutsk, while the primary intellectual and religious center was Kiev, and the Jews primarily spoke the Yiddish, Ruthenian, and Tatar languages. The community was primarily Ashkenazi with a Sephardi minority though the two communities appeared to have gotten along well.[6]

Casimir IV was religiously mentored by the antisemitic Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnick, despite this in 1453 he confirmed the 1388 charter and promised them continued liberty and safety but this move was heavily opposed by the Catholic Church and Cardinal Oleśnick. The Polish Church's opposition was mostly caused by the presence of John of Capistrano who blamed the Jews for the epidemic of 1464 as well as several military defeats of Polish and Lithuanian forces against the Muscovites. Due to this pressure Casimir issued the Statute of Nieszawa which nullified the Jews' extra privileges. Despite this statute the rights of Jews stayed the same as before.[6]

Casimir's reign also saw Jews begin to ascend socially in Lithuania. Casimir fired Jews as financiers, allowed them to become farmers, appointed them as customs inspectors, allowed them to trade freely, and allowed them to collect tolls. This saw a small percentage of the Jews transform into a rich and elitist group which imitated the rich's lifestyle most importantly by sending their children abroad for study. Though these Jews were disliked by the clergy, burghers, and petty nobility. As well as this social climb there was a population increase as Casimir expanded his lands and thus acquired new Jewish subjects within his new lands the old laws were generally unchanged and things became more politically centralized.[6]

Some Lithuanian Jews individually also rose to become quite important even compared to the other noble Jews including: Rabbi Moishe Hagoleh, Daniel and Ze'ev of Trakai who were important farms, and Moishe of Trakai who was an important businessman.[6]

After his death Casimir was greatly mourned by the Jews of Poland and Lithuania.[6]

Casimir was succeeded as king of Poland by his son John Albert, and on the Lithuanian throne by his younger son, Alexander Jagiellon. The latter confirmed the charter of privileges granted to the Jews by his predecessors, and even gave them additional rights. His father's Jewish creditors received part of the sums due to them, the rest being withheld under various pretexts. The favorable attitude toward the Jews which had characterized the Lithuanian rulers for generations was unexpectedly and radically changed by a decree promulgated by Alexander in April 1495. By this decree all Jews and Karaites living in Lithuania proper and the adjacent territories were summarily ordered to leave the country.

Historian Simon Dubnow states there were 3 main reasons for the expulsion:[6]

As part of the expulsion, it was decided that Jews who converted to Christianity would be allowed to stay, and this option was taken by several influential Jewish families.[6]

The expulsion was evidently not accompanied by the usual cruelties; for there was no popular animosity toward the Lithuanian Jews, and the decree was regarded as an act of mere willfulness on the part of an absolute ruler. Some of the nobility, however, approved Alexander's decree, expecting to profit by the departure of their Jewish creditors, as is indicated by numerous lawsuits on the return of the exiles to Lithuania in 1503. It is known from the Hebrew sources that some of the exiles migrated to Crimea, and that by far the greater number settled in Poland, where, by permission of King John I Albert, they established themselves in towns situated near the Lithuanian boundary. This permission, given at first for a period of two years, was extended ""because of the extreme poverty of the Jews on account of the great losses sustained by them."" The extension, which applied to all the towns of the kingdom, accorded the enjoyment of all the liberties that had been granted to their Polish brethren (Kraków, June 29, 1498). The expelled Karaites settled in the Polish town of Ratne, now in Ukraine.

Alexander Jagiellon after much delay incorporated the previously annulled Charter of 1388 into law on October 25th 1500; as by 1500 the nobility and monarchy had accepted that they had to allow the Jews to return and were drafting legislation to do so. They needed to allowed the Jews to return because the Lithuania was not financially stable enough to not need the Jews, especially because the state exchequer and the nobility were monetarily drained from wars with Muscovy and the Ottoman empire.[6]

Soon after in 1503, Alexander permitted the Jewish exiles to return to Lithuania. Beginning in March 1503, as is shown by documents still extant, their houses, lands, synagogues, and cemeteries were returned to them, and permission was granted them to collect their old debts. The new charter of privileges permitted them to live throughout Lithuania as before. The return of the Jews and their attempt to regain their old possessions led to many difficulties and lawsuits. Alexander found it necessary to issue an additional decree (April 1503), directing his vice-regent to enforce the law. In spite of this some of the property was not recovered by the Jews for years.

After their return the Jews resumed their previous position as tax farmers, toll collectors, money lenders, and landlords. With many also moving to riverside areas due to the better business there.[6]

At the same time, the middle of the 16th century witnessed a growing antagonism between the lesser nobility and the Jews. Their relations became strained, and the enmity of the Christians began to disturb the life of the Lithuanian Jews. The anti-Jewish feeling, due at first to economic causes engendered by competition, was fostered by the clergy, who were then engaged in a crusade against heretics, notably the Lutherans, Calvinists, and Jews. The Reformation, which had spread from Germany, tended to weaken the allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. Frequent instances occurred of the marriage of Catholic women to Jews, Turks, or Tatars. The Bishop of Vilnius complained to Sigismund August (Dec., 1548) of the frequency of such mixed marriages and of the education of the offspring in their fathers' faiths. The shlyakhta also saw in the Jews dangerous competitors in commercial and financial undertakings. In their dealings with the agricultural classes the lords preferred the Jews as middlemen, thus creating a feeling of injury on the part of the szlachta. The exemption of the Jews from military service and the power and wealth of the Jewish tax-farmers intensified the resentment of the szlachta. Members of the nobility, like Borzobogaty, Zagorovski, and others, attempted to compete with the Jews as leaseholders of customs revenues, but were never successful. Since the Jews lived in the towns and on the lands of the king, the nobility could not wield any authority over them nor derive profit from them. They had not even the right to settle Jews on their estates without the permission of the king; but, on the other hand, they were often annoyed by the erection on their estates of the toll houses of the Jewish tax-collectors.

Hence when the favorable moment arrived, the Lithuanian nobility endeavored to secure greater power over the Jews. At the Diet of Vilna in 1551 the nobility urged the imposition of a special poll tax of one ducat per head, and the Volhynian nobles demanded that the Jewish tax-collectors be forbidden to erect tollhouses or place guards at the taverns on their estates.

The opposition to the Jews was finally crystallized and found definite expression in the repressive Lithuanian statute of 1566, when the Lithuanian nobles were first allowed to take part in the national legislation. Paragraph Twelve of this statute contains the following articles:

Other restrictions of a similar nature are contained in the same paragraph. However, the king checked the desire of the nobility to modify essentially the old charters of the Jews.[citation needed]

Stephen Báthory was similar to his short ruled predecessor Henry the Third in that they both looked to the Jewish community to help Lithuania recover from the ongoing political instability and financial issues. Stephen was also a reformer which included improving the Vilnius education system by summoning Jewish intellectual to teach there. He also granted concession to the Zaporozhian Cossacks and the Jews, with Stephen being so eager to encourage Jewish merchants that he restriced the trading rights of 30,000 Scottish merchants active in Poland and Lithuania.[6]

Sigismund III Vasa came to power after Báthory's death while preparing for war with the Ottoman Empire. In 1589 he accepted the Third Lithuanian Statute. This was important because while the statute said little about the Jews in particular it would form the basis of Lithuanian law and thus Jewish life in Lithuania until 1840, but under his reign the Liberum veto (English: Free Veto) which allowed any noble to declare a veto and thus kill any piece of legislation, over time this would prove to become the death of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[6]

Sigismund was born to Protestant father in a Protestant country but because of his Catholic mother he became a zealous Catholic; because of this he encouraged a new era of Catholic zealotry which led to the Jesuits being given a Carte Blanche (English: Blank Check) to proselytize via sermons, processions, and holding mass. Sigismund allowed the Jesuits to expand their power and helped by appointing the Jesuit Piotr Skarga as court preacher and rector of the University of Vilnius, he also allowed the Jesuits to continue their ongoing efforts to squash the growing renaissance and Humanist movements. Most importantly for the Jews he helped the Jesuits in their ongoing mission to persecute heretics; which included: Protestants, those who still practiced Pagan customs, and above all Jews.[6]

Symptomatic of this new era, in May of 1592 a mob led by Jesuit inspired burghers attacked Jewish properties, homes, and the synagogue in Vilnius. The Lithuanian Trubinal sentenced some participants to prison sentences and ordered the payment of 13,500 Shoks to the Jewish community as reparation but since the court had no power to enforce this, and those that could enforce it refused to do so the mob got away without anyone being sent to prison and no reparations being paid.[6]

Since the mid 1500's the Commonwealth had gradually been expanding into modern day Ukraine and Belarus, and the jews became valuable partner to the nobility in their development of these regions, with some Jews were even being allowed to own land. While many Jews still worked as money lenders, tax collectors, peddlers, or brokers; many others began to work in agriculture, crafts, dyeing, forestry, horse and cattle farming. Jewish communities spread out over the new territories and they were given the rights to brew and distill alcohol. Despite their cooperation, the Jews were still socially inferior to the Nobility; they served as middle men with the nobles and wealthy on one side and the Ukrainian peasantry on the other. In the future this would cause major problems for the Jews.[6]

During the Polish–Russian War (1609–1618) the Jews served a very important financiers for the Commonwealth with the brothers Eliezer and Samuel Ben Moshe being the most important ones. They also served as important financiers during the Smolensk War.[6]

In spite of Jewish influence the Jewish Charter renewed in 1629 and Jewish rights were actually expanded. Jews could now only be summoned to the Fortress or Royal Courts which circumvented the antisemitism of the lower courts, they were made exempt from surtaxes, they were allowed the expand their cemeteries, slaughterhouses, mikvehs and this strengthened the community. Three years later in May of 1632, Sigismund issued an injunction against violence against Jews and interfering with their businesses. He also advised the Burghers that they should seek arbitration rather than litigation in disputes with Jews to avoid burdening the legal system.[6]

Ladislaus greatly employed Jews and accordingly reconfirmed their charter in 1644 while also empowered the Appeals Court made up of him and his ministers to intervene in cases to protect the Jews from any assailant, including the Burghers and Nobility. He then enacted an ordinance (1644-45) which gave the Jews the right to deal in skins, clothes, linen, furs, silver, gold, mead, flax, animal fat, and spices on behalf of the nobility. The Jews of Vilnius also gained new freedoms in crafts, guilds, and small industry which spread to the rest of Lithuanian Jewry. Ladislaus alos ordered the municipalities to protect Jews from violence[6]

At the same time Ladislaus also restricted the rights of Jews in other areas. They weren't allowed the sell cattle on other behalf, they could only sell alcohol to christians wholesale and in cities, when working for christians they could only work in specialized trades with no guild such as jewelry, furs, and glass. These changes ghettoized the Jews, banning them from rented or buying houes outside of their area of residence. The reason given was that these ghettos would protect the Jews from violence and looting, especially from the Jesuits and their disciples.[6]

Ladislaus and his nobility had a troubled relationship with the Ukrainian Cossacks for which the Jews would end up paying for dearly.[6]

The fury of this uprising destroyed the organization of the Lithuanian Jewish communities. The survivors who returned to their old homes in the latter half of the 17th century were practically destitute. The wars which raged constantly in the Lithuanian territory brought ruin to the entire country and deprived the Jews of the opportunity to earn more than a bare livelihood. The intensity of their struggle for existence left them no time to reestablish the conditions which had existed up to 1648. John Casimir (1648–1668) sought to ameliorate their condition by granting various concessions to the Jewish communities of Lithuania. Attempts to return to the old order in the communal organization were not wanting, as is evident from contemporary documents. Thus in 1672, Jewish elders from various towns and villages in the grand duchy of Lithuania secured a charter from King Michael Wiśniowiecki (1669–1673), decreeing ""that on account of the increasing number of Jews guilty of offenses against the Shlyakhta and other Christians, which result in the enmity of the Christians toward the Jews, and because of the inability of the Jewish elders to punish such offenders, who are protected by the lords, the king permits the kahals to summon the criminals before the Jewish courts for punishment and exclusion from the community when necessary."" The efforts to resurrect the old power of the kahals were not successful. The impoverished Jewish merchants, having no capital of their own, were compelled to borrow money from the nobility, from churches, congregations, monasteries, and various religious orders. Loans from the latter were usually for an unlimited period and were secured by mortgages on the real estate of the kahal. The kahals thus became hopelessly indebted to the clergy and the nobility.

In 1653 Sweden and Russia, sensing weakness invaded the Commonwealth. Vilnius was captured by the Russians in 1655 and Russians and Cossacks sacked for 17 days with Poles and Jews either being killed or fleeing the city. Many Jews from across Lithuania fled to Amsterdam where, according eyewitnesses the Jews of Amsterdam treaed them kindly; other went to other cities such as Frankfurt and were also treated kindly by the Jewish communities of these other cities. The Polish liberated Lithuania in 1661 and at this point Jews began to return to the area with help from the king and the Jesuits, who also helped the Jews rebuild their communities.[6]

By 1665 the Jews were under royal protection from physical and political assault but they had a powerful new enemy in the emerging middle class. The middle class, as owner of factories and shops were in constant economic competition with Jews and as Christians they had never accepted Jews as equals and were jealous of the Jews success. They expressed this disdain by organizing pogroms and spreading religious hatred against the Jews. The royal court was asked many times to restrict the rights of Jews and they usually obliged. Jewish trading days were reduced, Jews ere banned from selling meat on Fridays and Ash Wednesday, Jews were banned from trading fish, jews were banned from working as silversmiths, goldsmiths, tanners, and bristle manufacturers.[6]

The war had devastated Lithuanian Jewry with mass death, rampant poverty, assimilation, and destruction being omnipresent. Over 400 Jewish communities had been destroyed and many were made homeless. Local jewish communities attempted to help the homeless but the burden was too high for them so the Council of Four Lands and Kahal of Liuthuania assumed responsibility, going into debt to help the poor, sometimes borrowing from Catholic Clergy and Churches.[6]

It was at this time when letters from Israel, Thessalonika, and Izmir began to arrive telling of a messiah who had arisen in Israel by the name of Shabtai Tzvi. News of this messiah spread quickly across the Jewish world from Yemen, to Lithuania, to Essequibo with many Jews being swept up in the excitement. They believed that Shabtai would lead them in a Gathering of Israel where they would return to the land of Israel. In preparation for this many businesses ad properties were sold and wealthy believers made arrangements to rent ships for the journey. Skeptics remained though, especially among the learned with many writings appearing viciously denouncing Shabtai.[6]

The movement was shattered in 1666 went Shabtai Tzvi converted to Islam, and this led the majority of Sabbateans to revert to mainstream Judaism but a minority either followed Shabtai into Islam forming the Dönmeh who outwardly practiced Islam but were secretly Jewish, reverted to Judaism but secretly remained Sabbatean, or remained outwardly Sabbatean. The anti-Sabbateans persecuted and attacked them demanding a return to strict Orthodoxy.[6]

Jewish crypto-Sabbateans continued to exist for over 100 years after Shabtai Tzvi's death. While public Sabbateanism in Lithuania was spread by Yehoshua Heshen ben Yosef. He joined the movement in 1666 and proclaimed Shabtai as the messiah, he led Sabbateans in Lithuania for 30 years before later moving the Krakow with a number of his followers. Other notable Sabbateans included Zodok of Grodno and possibly Judah Hasid though this is not known for sure. [6]

The founding of the yeshivot in Lithuania was due to the Lithuanian-Polish Jews who studied in the west, and to the German Jews who migrated about that time to Lithuania and Poland. Very little is known of these early yeshivot. No mention is made of them or of prominent Lithuanian rabbis in Jewish writings until the 16th century. The first known rabbinical authority and head of a yeshivah was Isaac Bezaleel of Vladimir, Volhynia, who was already an old man when Solomon Luria went to Ostroh in the fourth decade of the 16th century. Another rabbinical authority, Kalman Haberkaster, rabbi of Ostrog and predecessor of Luria, died in 1559. Occasional references to the yeshivah of Brest are found in the writings of the contemporary rabbis Solomon Luria (died 1585), Moses Isserles (died 1572), and David Gans (died 1613), who speak of its activity. Of the yeshivot of Ostrog and Vladimir in Volhynia it is known that they were flourishing in the middle of the 16th century, and that their heads vied with one another in Talmudic scholarship. Mention is also made by Gans of the head of the Kremenetz yeshivah, Isaac Cohen (died 1573), of whom but little is known otherwise.

At the time of the Lublin Union, Solomon Luria was rabbi of Ostrog, and was regarded as one of the greatest Talmudic authorities in Poland and Lithuania. In 1568 King Sigismund ordered that the suits between Isaac Borodavka and Mendel Isakovich, who were partners in the farming of certain customs taxes in Lithuania, be carried for decision to Rabbi Solomon Luria and two auxiliary rabbis from Pinsk and Tiktin.

The far-reaching authority of the leading rabbis of Poland and Lithuania, and their wide knowledge of practical life, are apparent from numerous decisions cited in the responsa. In the Eitan ha-Ezrachi (Ostrog, 1796) of Abraham Rapoport (known also as Abraham Schrenzel; died 1650), Rabbi Meïr Sack is cited as follows: ""I emphatically protest against the custom of our communal leaders of purchasing the freedom of Jewish criminals. Such a policy encourages crime among our people. I am especially troubled by the fact that, thanks to the clergy, such criminals may escape punishment by adopting Christianity. Mistaken piety impels our leaders to bribe the officials, in order to prevent such conversions. We should endeavor to deprive criminals of opportunities to escape justice."" The same sentiment was expressed in the 16th century by Maharam Lublin (Responsa, § 138). Another instance, cited by Katz from the same responsa, likewise shows that Jewish criminals invoked the aid of priests against the authority of Jewish courts by promising to become converts to Christianity.

The decisions of the Polish-Lithuanian rabbis are frequently marked by breadth of view also, as is instanced by a decision of Joel Sirkes (Bayis Hadash, § 127) to the effect that Jews may employ in their religious services the melodies used in Christian churches, ""since music is neither Jewish nor Christian, and is governed by universal laws.""

Decisions by Luria, Meïr Katz, and Mordecai Jaffe show that the rabbis were acquainted with the Russian language and its philology. Jaffe, for instance, in a divorce case where the spelling of the woman's name as Lupka or Lubka was in question, decided that the word is correctly spelled with a ""b,"" and not with a ""p,"" since the origin of the name was the Russian verb lubit = ""to love,"" and not lupit = ""to beat"" (Levush ha-Butz we-Argaman, § 129). Meïr Katz (Geburat Anashim, § 1) explains that the name of Brest-Litovsk is written in divorce cases ""Brest"" and not ""Brisk,"" ""because the majority of the Lithuanian Jews use the Russian language."" It is not so with Brisk, in the district of Kujawa, the name of that town being always spelled ""Brisk."" Katz (a German) at the conclusion of his responsum expresses the hope that when Lithuania shall have become more enlightened, the people will speak one language only—German—and that also Brest-Litovsk will be written ""Brisk.""

The responsa shed an interesting light also on the life of the Lithuanian Jews and on their relations to their Christian neighbors. Benjamin Aaron Solnik states in his Mas'at Binyamin (late 16th and early 17th century) that ""the Christians borrow clothes and jewelry from the Jews when they go to church."" Sirkes (l.c. § 79) relates that a Christian woman came to the rabbi and expressed her regret at having been unable to save the Jew Shlioma from drowning. A number of Christians had looked on indifferently while the drowning Jew was struggling in the water. They were upbraided and beaten severely by the priest, who appeared a few minutes later, for having failed to rescue the Jew.

Luria gives an account (Responsa, § 20) of a quarrel that occurred in a Lithuanian community concerning a cantor whom some of the members wished to dismiss. The synagogue was closed in order to prevent him from exercising his functions, and religious services were thus discontinued for several days. The matter was thereupon carried to the local lord, who ordered the reopening of the building, saying that the house of God might not be closed, and that the cantor's claims should be decided by the learned rabbis of Lithuania. Joseph Katz mentions (She'erit Yosef, § 70) a Jewish community which was forbidden by the local authorities to kill cattle and to sell meat—an occupation which provided a livelihood for a large portion of the Lithuanian Jews. For the period of a year following this prohibition the Jewish community was on several occasions assessed at the rate of three gulden per head of cattle in order to furnish funds with which to induce the officials to grant a hearing of the case. The Jews finally reached an agreement with the town magistrates under which they were to pay forty gulden annually for the right to slaughter cattle. According to Hillel ben Herz (Bet Hillel, Yoreh De'ah, § 157), Naphtali says the Jews of Vilnius had been compelled to uncover their heads when taking an oath in court, but later purchased from the tribunal the privilege to swear with covered head, a practice subsequently made unnecessary by a decision of one of their rabbis to the effect that an oath might be taken with uncovered head.

The responsa of Meïr Lublin show (§ 40) that the Lithuanian communities frequently aided the German and the Austrian Jews. On the expulsion of the Jews from Silesia, when the Jewish inhabitants of Silz had the privilege of remaining on condition that they would pay the sum of 2,000 gulden, the Lithuanian communities contributed one-fifth of the amount.

Religious observances owe greatly to Elijah ben Solomon (1720–1797), the Vilna Gaon,[8] who lived in Lithuania's greatest city, Vilnius. His style of Torah and Talmud study shaped the analytical ""Lithuanian-style"" form of learning still practiced in most yeshivas. The yeshiva movement itself is a typical Lithuanian development, initiated by the Vilna Gaon's main disciple, Rabbi Chaim of Volozhin.

The Misnagdim were the early opponents of Hasidic Judaism, led by the Vilna Gaon who sharply denounced the innovations by the Hasidim. Despite this, several prominent Hasidic scholars and dynasties originated from Lithuania such as Karlin-Stolin founded by Aharon of Karlin, Kopust founded by Yehuda Leib Schneersohn and Koidanov. Some Polish Hasidic dynasties even settled in Lithuania such as those of Elijah Winograd.

In 1795 the final Third Partition ended the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the former lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became part of the Russian partition.

By the end of the 19th century, many of Lithuania's Jews fled Eastern Europe to escape the Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire and the antisemitism. Tens of thousands of Lithuanian Jews emigrated to the United States of America and South Africa.[9] A small number also emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, to the Palestine region that would become British Mandate of Palestine.

In 1772 the Karaites sought an official divorce from the Jewish community, the Jewish Council of Lithuania which they belonged to was disbanded and the Karaites withdrew from the Kahals while also petitioning the government for separate legal status and autonomy. Before this the Karaites had considered themselves Jewish but by 1783 the Karaites of Lithuania had embarked on a separate path.[6]

It wasn't until 1795 that this new situation was set in law, as the Russian Empire took control of Lithuania Catherine II signed legislation which legally differentiated the statuses of Rabbinic Jews and Karaites. Over time the grew groups grew increasingly different. In 1829 Karaites were exempted from military service while Jews weren't, in 1835 the jews of Troki where expelled by the Russians at the request of the Karaites, in 1840 Karaites where given equal status to Muslims, and finally in 1863 they were given the same rights as Russians. This whole time Jews were severely discriminated against by the Russian Empire.[6]

Lithuanian Jews took an active part in Freedom wars of Lithuania. On December 29, 1918, Lithuania's government called for volunteers to defend the Lithuanian state; of 10,000 volunteers more than 500 Jewish. More than 3,000 Jews served in the Lithuanian army between 1918 and 1923.[15] Initially, the Jewish community was given a wide amount of autonomy in education and taxation through community councils, or kehillot.[citation needed]

In 1923, all over Lithuania, inscriptions and signboards in non-Lithuanian languages were smeared with tar and fascist groups posted renunciations on the walls of houses.[16] Lithuanian Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras officially condemned antisemitic acts of coating of signs with tar by stating that ""every Lithuanian, passing by these tarred signboards, must lower his eyes in shame"".[16]

By 1934, in a nationalist trend that reflected throughout Europe, the government scaled back much of this autonomy, and cases of antisemitism increased.[citation needed]

Lithuanian President Antanas Smetona was known for his tolerant stance towards Jews and his radical opponents not once nicknamed him as ""Jewish King"".[16][18] Under Smetona's rule in Lithuania, not a single anti-Jewish law was passed and high-ranking Lithuanian officials, including ministers, did not publicly say anti-Jewish statements.[18] Smetona considered Jews not as foreigners, but as Lithuanian citizens of foreign nationality and himself acted against antisemitic acts with his statements which were later followed by actions of governmental institutions (e.g. censorship).[18] The Lithuanian courts, war commandants, Lithuanian Police Force severely punished the participants of anti-Jewish physical attacks or smashing of Jews windows (the culprits were punished with fines, imprisoned or even sent to hard labor prisons).[18] Moreover, the Government of Lithuania also did not tolerate anti-Jewish attacks and severely punished their participants, especially activists.[18] Consequently, Jews wished Smetona a long rule of Lithuania.[18] However, under Smetona's rule Lithuania was anti-communist and did not tolerate insults of German government but at the same time protected non-offending Jews as in 1934 the Ministry of National Defence of Lithuania adopted an order to counties commandants where it was stated to ""severely punish all those who insult the German Government in any way, as well as those who deliberately agitate against Lithuanian Jews; to suppress the activity of all those Jewish organizations which appear to be under Communist cover or succumb to Communist influence"".[18] The 1938 Constitution of Lithuania (the last in interwar period) did not change Lithuanian Jews situation and it remained as such until the occupation of Lithuania in 1940.[18]

After the Soviet occupation in June 1940, some Jewish communists assumed significant roles in the NKVD and local communist nomenklatura (e.g. Nachman Dushanski).[19][20] Other Jews, particularly religious Jews and Zionists, were treated harshly by the Soviet-imposed communist government in Lithuania prior to the German invasion.[citation needed]

The Lithuanian Republic was occupied by Soviet Union in June 1940, and one year later, in June 1941, occupied by the Germans. During World War II, 91–95% of Lithuania's Jewish population were killed – almost all the Jews who had not managed to leave Lithuania and its environs. This was the highest casualty rate of Jews in any nation in the Holocaust.[21][better source needed]

The only European yeshiva to survive the Holocaust was the Mir Yeshiva. With help of the Japanese consul in Kaunas, Chiune Sugihara, its leaders and students managed to escape to the Shanghai Ghetto.

Following the expulsion of Nazi German forces in 1944, The Soviets reannexed Lithuania as a Soviet republic, and prosecuted a number of Lithuanians for collaborating with the Nazis. Sites of wartime massacres, such as the Ninth Fort near Kaunas became monuments. To avoid nationalist themes, the memorials were declared in the name of all victims, though the clear majority of them were Jewish. Most survivors never returned, moving to Israel instead. Throughout Soviet rule, there was tension between the Jewish community and the authorities over the right to emigrate to Israel, and how to properly commemorate the Holocaust. The majority of Jews in Soviet Lithuania arrived after the war, with Russian and Yiddish as their primary language.

Despite the lack of any intent to support the project, the Jewish community was allowed to open the Jewish Museum in 1944 which was located in the apartment of its first director, Shmerl Kaczerginski.[22] The institution served as a community center which received hundreds of inquiries from all across the world about the fate of individual Jews in Lithuania.[22] In 1945 the museum was relocated to the former ghetto library and jail buildings in Vilnius.[22] The first exhibition at the museum was titled ""The Brutal Destruction of the Jews during the German Occupation"".[22] In 1949, the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic de facto closed down the museum when it ordered its reorganized into the Vilnius Local History Museum.[22] The Vilnius Jewish School was closed in 1946, and the one in Kaunas 1950.[22] Jewish cemetery in Vilnius was paved over,  the Old Vilnius Synagogue was razed while Jewish grave-stones were used to construct the stairs at the Tauras Hill, as well as those at the Evangelical Reformed Church.[22]  While institutionalized Jewish memory was abolished, a few memorials were allowed to continue with at least forty-five out of 231 Holocaust memorials in Lithuania being constructed before 1991.[22] The death of Stalin brought some improvement in the status of Lithuanian Jews, with new Jewish communities moving to the country from less developed parts of the USSR and some development of the Holocaust narrative over the years.[22] The book Mass Murders in Lithuania was published in 1965 and 1973 as the first publication directly addressing the topic of Holokaust.[22] The Art of Lithuania's Jews exhibition was opened in Kaunas and Vilnius in 1988 as the first public display of Jewish culture anywhere in the Soviet Union.[22] Lithuanian Jewish Cultural Association was established in 1988 and it was renamed into the Lithuanian Jewish Community in 1991.[22]

The Jewish population of Lithuania continues a slow decline. In the 2001 census, there were 4,007 Jews by ethnicity. This declined by 2011 to 3,050 and 2,256 by 2021. The Jews also had the oldest age profiles; 41% of Jews were in the 60+ age demographic and only 13.2% were under the age of 20. There were also 192 Karaims by ethnicity for a total of 2,448; this was a significant decrease from the number of 423 in 2011. Karaims have historically defined themselves as ethnically distinct from Jews in Lithuania. In both the 2001 and 2011 census, Jews were Lithuania's fifth biggest ethnic minority, behind Poles, Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians, and just ahead of Germans.[23][24]

Interest among descendants of Lithuanian Jews has spurred tourism and a renewal in research and preservation of the community's historic resources and possessions. Increasing numbers of Lithuanian Jews are interested in learning and practising the use of Yiddish.[25] In 2000, the Jewish population of the country was 3,600.[26]

The beginning of the 21st century was marked by conflicts between members of Chabad-Lubavitch and secular leaders. In 2005, Chief Rabbi Sholom Ber Krinsky was physically removed from the Synagogue by two men hired by the community's secular leader Mr. Alperovich, who then declared a new Chief Rabbi.[27] For more detail, see Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies: Lithuania.

Public debate has ensued over memorials to Nazi collaborators. In 2019, a memorial plaque in central Vilnius was smashed with a sledgehammer by Jewish Lithuanian politician Stanislovas Tomas.[28][29] Lithuanian authorities also removed several memorials of other collaborators. The removal of these memorials sparked antisemitic backlash, leading to threats against the Choral Synagogue, Vilnius's only remaining synagogue, along with the Jewish community headquarters, both of which were temporarily shuttered due to the threats.[30]

In February 2024, the European Jewish Congress reported that security cameras caught an unknown perpetrator throwing a stone at the Litvak Jewish Community (LJC) center and breaking the glass, as well as stones being thrown into the homes of Jews in Šiauliai County.[31]

Lithuanians,"Lithuanians (Lithuanian: lietuviai[a]) are a Baltic ethnic group. They are native to Lithuania, where they number around 2,378,118 people.[2] Another two million make up the Lithuanian diaspora, largely found in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil and Canada. Their native language is Lithuanian, one of only two surviving members of the Baltic language family along with Latvian. According to the census conducted in 2021, 84.6% of the population of Lithuania identified themselves as Lithuanians. Most Lithuanians belong to the Catholic Church, while the Lietuvininkai who lived in the northern part of East Prussia prior to World War II, were mostly Lutherans.

The territory of the Balts, including modern Lithuania, was once inhabited by several Baltic tribal entities (Sudovians, Lithuanians, Curonians, Semigallians, Selonians, Samogitians, Skalvians, Old Prussians (Nadruvians)), as attested by ancient sources and dating from prehistoric times. Over the centuries, and especially under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, some of these tribes consolidated into the Lithuanian nation, mainly as a defence against the marauding Teutonic Order and Eastern Slavs. The Lithuanian state was formed in the High Middle Ages, with different historians dating this variously between the 11th and mid-13th centuries.[18] Mindaugas, Lithuania's only crowned king and its first baptised ruler, is generally considered Lithuania's founder.[19] The Lithuanians are the only branch of Baltic people that managed to create a state entity before the modern era.[20][21][22] During the Late Middle Ages, Lithuania was ravaged by the Lithuanian Crusade, which ended only by the Treaty of Melno in 1422. In fact, the crusade persisted after the definite Christianization of Lithuania in 1387, when Europe's last pagan people were baptised.[20][23] Simultaneously, the Lithuanian state reached its apogee under the rule of Vytautas the Great (r. 1392–1430), when it ruled the lands between the Baltic and Black seas. Thereafter, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania continued existing until 1795, however, since the Union of Lublin in 1569, it maintained its independence in the bi-confederal Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[24] In the 16th century the Lithuanian humanists based the national consciousness of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania on the idea of their national singularity or uniqueness and considered the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an independent country.[25]

There is a current argument that the Lithuanian language was considered non-prestigious enough by some elements in Lithuanian society, meaning that the number of Lithuanian language-speakers decreased with Polonization in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as a Germanisation of Prussia. The subsequent imperial Russian occupation from 1795 until 1915, with some interpositions such as the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Uprisings of 1831 and 1863, accelerated this process of Slavicization. While under Russian occupation, Lithuanians endured Russification, which included the 40-year-long ban on public speaking and writing in Lithuanian (see, e.g., Knygnešiai, the actions against the Catholic Church). In such a context, the Lithuanian National Revival began in the 19th century. Some believed at the time that the Lithuanian nation as such, along with its language, would become extinct within a few generations.

Some of the Polish- and Belarusian-speaking persons from the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania expressed their affiliation with the modern Lithuanian nation in the early 20th century, including Michał Pius Römer, Stanisław Narutowicz, Oscar Milosz and Tadas Ivanauskas

In February 1918, while World War I was ongoing, the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian state was declared, 122 years after it was destroyed. In the aftermath of World War I, Lithuanians militarily defended their country's independence from Poland, Whites and Soviet Russia during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. However, a third of Lithuania's lands, namely the Vilnius Region, as well as its declared capital, fell under Polish occupation during the Interwar. A standardised Lithuanian language was approved. In the lead-up to the World War II, the Klaipėda Region was occupied by Nazi Germany after the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.

""We do not know on whose merits or guilt such a decision was made, or with what we have offended Your Lordship so much that Your Lordship has deservedly been directed against us, creating hardship for us everywhere. First of all, you made and announced a decision about the land of Samogitia, which is our inheritance and our homeland from the legal succession of the ancestors and elders. We still own it, it is and has always been the same Lithuanian land, because there is one language and the same inhabitants. But since the land of Samogitia is located lower than the land of Lithuania, it is called as Samogitia, because in Lithuanian it is called lower land [ Žemaitija ]. And the Samogitians call Lithuania as Aukštaitija, that is, from the Samogitian point of view, a higher land. Also, the people of Samogitia have long called themselves Lithuanians and never – Samogitians, and because of such identity (sic) we do not write about Samogitia in our letter, because everything is one: one country and the same inhabitants.""

The territory inhabited by the ethnic Lithuanians has shrunk over centuries; once Lithuanians made up a majority of the population not only in what is now Lithuania, but also in northwestern Belarus, in large areas of the territory of the modern Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia, and in some parts of modern Latvia and Poland.[29]

In 1940, Lithuania was invaded and occupied by the Soviet Union, and forced to join it as the Lithuanian SSR. The Germans and their allies attacked the USSR in June 1941, and from 1941 to 1944, Lithuania was occupied by Germany. The Germans retreated in 1944, and Lithuania fell under Soviet rule once again. The long-standing communities of Lithuanians in the Kaliningrad Oblast (Lithuania Minor) were almost destroyed as a result.

The Lithuanian nation as such remained primarily in Lithuania, a few villages in northeastern Poland, southern Latvia and also in the diaspora of emigrants. Some indigenous Lithuanians still remain in Belarus and the Kaliningrad Oblast, but their numbers are small compared to what they used to be. Lithuania regained its independence in 1990, and was recognized by most countries in 1991. It became a member of the European Union on May 1, 2004.[citation needed]

Among the Baltic states, Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2001, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups such as Ukrainians, Jews, Germans, Tatars, Latvians, Romani, Estonians, Crimean Karaites etc.

Poles are mostly concentrated in the Vilnius County. Especially large Polish communities are located in the Vilnius District Municipality and the Šalčininkai District Municipality.

Despite being the capital, Vilnius was not the largest city by number of Lithuanians until mid-2000s. According to the 2011 census Vilnius had 337,000 Lithuanians while Kaunas had 316,000.[30]

Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered. The most prominent community lives in the Visaginas Municipality (52%). Most of them are workers who moved from Russia to work at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. A number of ethnic Russians left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.

In the past, the ethnic composition of Lithuania has varied dramatically. The most prominent change was the extermination of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Before World War II, about 7.5% of the population was Jewish[citation needed]; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, which was sometimes nicknamed the northern Jerusalem, was about 30% Jewish.[citation needed] Almost all its Jews were killed during the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania, some 75,000 alone between the years 1941 – 1942,[31] while others later immigrated to the United States and Israel. Now there are about 3,200 Jews living in Lithuania.[32]

Apart from the various religious and ethnic groups currently residing in Lithuania, Lithuanians themselves retain and differentiate between their regional identities; there are 5 historic regional groups: Žemaičiai, Suvalkiečiai, Aukštaičiai, Dzūkai and Lietuvininkai,[33] the last of which is virtually extinct. City dwellers are usually considered just Lithuanians, especially ones from large cities such as Vilnius or Kaunas.
The four groups are delineated according to certain region-specific traditions, dialects, and historical divisions. There are some stereotypes used in jokes about these subgroups, for example, Sudovians are supposedly frugal while Samogitians are stubborn.

Since the late Neolithic period the native inhabitants of the Lithuanian territory have not been replaced by migrations from outside, so there is a high probability that the inhabitants of present-day Lithuania have preserved the genetic composition of their forebears relatively undisturbed by the major demographic movements,[34] although without being actually isolated from them.[35] The Lithuanian population appears to be relatively homogeneous, without apparent genetic differences among ethnic subgroups.[36]

A 2004 analysis of mtDNA in a Lithuanian population revealed that Lithuanians are close to both Indo-European and Uralic-speaking populations of Northern Europe. Y-chromosome SNP haplogroup analysis showed Lithuanians to be closest to Latvians, Estonians, Belarusians and southern Finns. This is the result of Iron Age Europe.[37] Autosomal SNP analysis situates Lithuanians most proximal to Latvians, followed by the westernmost East Slavs; furthermore, Germans and West Slavs (especially Poles) are situated more proximal to Lithuanians than Finns and northern Russians.[38]

Lithuanian Ashkenazi Jews display a number of unique genetic characteristics; the utility of these variations has been the subject of debate.[39] One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century, corresponding to the establishment of Ashkenazi settlements in response to the invitation extended by Vytautas the Great in 1388.[40]

At the end of the 19th century, the average height of males was 163.5 cm (5 ft 4 in) and the average height of females was 153.3 cm (5 ft 0 in). By the end of the 20th century, heights averaged 181.3 cm (5 ft 11 in) for males and 167.5 cm (5 ft 6 in) for females.[41]

Lithuanian settlement extends into adjacent countries that are now outside the modern Lithuanian state. A small Lithuanian community exists in the vicinity of Puńsk and Sejny in the Suwałki area of Poland, an area associated with the Lithuanian writer and cleric Antanas Baranauskas.[42]
Although most of the Lithuanian inhabitants in the region of Lithuania Minor that formed part of East Prussia were expelled when the area was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Kaliningrad Oblast, small groups of Lithuanians subsequently settled that area as it was repopulated with new Soviet citizens. Small groups of Lithuanians are still present in Belarus within the Grodno and Vitebsk regions.[43]

Apart from the traditional communities in Lithuania and its neighboring countries, Lithuanians have emigrated to other continents during the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

The Lithuanian national sport is usually considered to be basketball (krepšinis), which is popular among Lithuanians in Lithuania as well as in the diasporic communities. Basketball came to Lithuania through the Lithuanian-American community in the 1930s. Lithuanian basketball teams were bronze medal winners in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics.[citation needed]

Joninės (also known as Rasos) is a traditional national holiday, celebrated on the summer solstice. It has pagan origins. Užgavėnės (Shrove Tuesday) takes place on the day before Ash Wednesday, and is meant to urge the retreat of winter. There are also national traditions for Christian holidays such as Easter and Christmas.[citation needed]

Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with other European cuisines and features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's rich history.[citation needed]

Since shared similarities in history and heritage, Lithuanians, Jews and Poles have developed many similar dishes and beverages: dumplings ( koldūnai), doughnuts (spurgos), and crepes (lietiniai blynai). German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (kugelis) and potato sausages (vėdarai), as well as the baroque tree cake known as šakotis. Traditional dishes of Lithuanian Tatars and Lithuanian Karaites like Kibinai and čeburekai, that are similar to pasty, are popular in Lithuania.[citation needed]

For Lithuanian Americans both traditional Lithuanian dishes of virtinukai (cabbage and noodles) and balandėliai (rolled cabbage) are growing increasingly more popular.[citation needed]

There are also regional cuisine dishes, e.g. traditional kastinys in Žemaitija, Western Lithuania, Skilandis in Western and Central Lithuania, Kindziukas in Eastern and Southern Lithuania (Dzūkija).[citation needed]

Cepelinai, a stuffed potato creation, is the most popular national dish. It is popular among Lithuanians all over the world. Other national foods include dark rye bread, cold beet soup (šaltibarščiai), and kugelis (a baked potato pudding). Some of these foods are also common in neighboring countries. Lithuanian cuisine is generally unknown outside Lithuanian communities. Most Lithuanian restaurants outside Lithuania are located in cities with a heavy Lithuanian presence.[citation needed]

Lithuanians in the early 20th century were among the thinnest people in the developed countries of the world.[47] In Lithuanian cuisine there is some emphasis on attractive presentation of freshly prepared foods.

Lithuania has been brewing midus, a type of Lithuanian mead for thousands of years.[48]

Locally brewed beer (alus), vodka (degtinė), and kvass (gira) are popular drinks in Lithuania. Lithuanian traditional beer of Northern Lithuania, Biržai, Pasvalys regions is well appreciated in Lithuania and abroad.[49] Starka is a part of the Lithuanian heritage, still produced in Lithuania.

Among Indo-European languages, Lithuanian is conservative in its grammar and phonology, retaining archaic features otherwise found only in ancient languages such as Sanskrit (particularly its early form, Vedic Sanskrit) or Ancient Greek.[50] Thus, it is an important source for the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language despite its late attestation (with the earliest texts dating only to c. 1500 A.D., whereas Ancient Greek was first written down in c. 1450 B.C.).[51] There was fascination with the Lithuanian people and their language among the late 19th-century researchers, and the philologist Isaac Taylor wrote the following in his The Origin of the Aryans (1892):

""Thus it would seem that the Lithuanians have the best claim to represent the primitive Aryan race, as their language exhibits fewer of those phonetic changes, and of those grammatical losses which are consequent on the acquirement of a foreign speech.""[52]

The Proto-Balto-Slavic language branched off directly from Proto-Indo-European, then sub-branched into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic. Proto-Baltic branched off into Proto-West Baltic and Proto-East Baltic.[50] Baltic languages passed through a Proto-Balto-Slavic stage, from which Baltic languages retain numerous exclusive and non-exclusive lexical, morphological, phonological and accentual isoglosses in common with the Slavic languages, which represent their closest living Indo-European relatives. Moreover, with Lithuanian being so archaic in phonology, Slavic words can often be deduced from Lithuanian by regular sound laws; for example, Lith. vilkas and Polish wilk ← PBSl. *wilkás (cf. PSl. *vьlkъ) ← PIE *wĺ̥kʷos, all meaning ""wolf"".

When the ban against printing the Lithuanian language was lifted in 1904, various European literary movements such as Symbolism, impressionism, and expressionism each in turn influenced the work of Lithuanian writers. The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918–1940) gave them the opportunity to examine themselves and their characters more deeply, as their primary concerns were no longer political. An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, a novelist and dramatist. His many works include Dainavos šalies senų žmonių padavimai (Old Folks Tales of Dainava, 1912) and the historical dramas Šarūnas (1911), Skirgaila (1925), and Mindaugo mirtis (The Death of Mindaugas, 1935). Petras Vaičiūnas was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s. Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas wrote lyric poetry, plays, and novels, including the novel Altorių šešėly (In the Shadows of the Altars, 3 vol., 1933), a remarkably powerful autobiographical novel.

Keturi vėjai movement started with publication of The Prophet of the Four Winds by talented poet Kazys Binkis (1893—1942). It was rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of Keturi vėjai initially was futurism which arrived through Russia from the West and later cubism, dadaism, surrealism, unanimism, and German expressionism. The most influensive futurist for Lithuanian writers was Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky.[53]

Oskaras Milašius (1877–1939) is a paradoxical and interesting phenomenon in Lithuanian culture. He never lived in Lithuania but was born and spent his childhood in Cereja (near Mogilev, Belarus) and graduated from Lycée Janson de Sailly in Paris. His longing for his fatherland was more metaphysical. Having to choose between two conflicting countries — Lithuania and Poland — he preferred Lithuania which for him was an idea even more than a fatherland. In 1920 when France recognized the independence of Lithuania, he was appointed officially as Chargé d'Affaires for Lithuania. He published: 1928, a collection of 26 Lithuanian songs; 1930, Lithuanian Tales and Stories; 1933, Lithuanian Tales; 1937, The origin of the Lithuanian Nation.

Since the Christianization of parts of Lithuania proper in 1387 and of Samogitia in 1413, the majority of Lithuanians have been members of the Roman Catholic Church. According to the 2021 census, 74% of Lithuanians are Roman Catholic.[citation needed] Under Article 26 of the Constitution of Lithuania, persons can freely practice a religion of their choosing.[54]

Catholicism played a significant role in Lithuanian anti-communist resistance under the Soviet Union. Several Catholic priests were leaders of the anti-communist movements, and thousands of Latin crosses were placed on the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai, despite its being bulldozed in 1961.[citation needed]

Lithuanian folk music is based around songs (dainos), which include romantic and wedding songs, as well as work songs and archaic war songs. These songs used to be performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklės, a kind of zither that accompanies sutartinės, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, (including a bass fiddle called the basetle) and a kind of whistle called the Lamzdeliai lumzdelis; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and bandoneon. Sutartinė can be accompanied by skudučiai, a form of panpipes played by a group of people, as well as wooden trumpets (ragai and dandytės). Kanklės is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of strings and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include švilpas whistle, drums and tabalas (a percussion instrument like a gong), sekminių ragelis (bagpipe) and the pūslinė, a musical bow made from a pig's bladder filled with dried peas.[55]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanians

History of Lithuanian culture,"The culture of Lithuania, dating back to 200 BC, with the settlement of the Balts and has been independent of the presence of a sovereign Lithuanian state.[1]

The Lithuanian nation rose between the 7th and 9th centuries CE. Earlier, the Balts, ancestors of Lithuanians and Latvians, had arrived at the territories between the Dnepr and Daugava rivers and the Baltic Sea. An Indo-European people, the Balts are presumed to have come from a hypothetic original homeland of the Proto-Indo-Europeans; many scientists date this arrival to 3rd millennium BCE.

The Balts, who are believed to have arrived with the main wave of Indo-Europeans, were unconnected with the formation of later Indo-European nations in Southern and Western Europe. Thus, the Balts' culture is believed to have preserved primeval features of Indo-European culture for a longer time. When later contacts with newly formed European nations increased, differences between the Balts' primeval culture and the culture of the new European nations were so great that closer cultural interchange was difficult. This resulted in preservation of the Balts' Indo-European roots but may also have contributed to their isolation.

After the period of Gothic domination in Europe, the culture of the Balts appeared in a more restricted territory between the Wisla and Daugava rivers. Almost anything said about the Balts' cultural isolation level in these times is speculation, but it was likely decreasing. Still, the Balts conserved forms of ancient Indo-European proto-language until much later times. The most archaic language forms were preserved by the Western Balts, who lived approximately in the territory of later Prussia (today's Kaliningrad and north-west Poland). These dialects developed into Old Prussian, which became extinct by the beginning of the 18th century.

The Eastern Balts had less archaic forms of language. For example, some popular simplifications took hold, such as a decrease in the number of verb forms, which presumably happened when the ancient cultural elite lost its influence over the people. It may have taken place, for example, in times of ""barbarian"" invasions (not later than the 8th century). Later, eastern dialects of Balts developed into the modern Lithuanian and Latvian.

Knowledge about the Balts' cultural life in these times is scanty. It is known that Balts at the end of this period had a social structure comparable with that of Celtic people in South-West Europe during the 2nd—1st centuries BC.

In the 10th century, religious life of the Balts was not unified, with various forms of cults present. An important feature of Balt culture was willful avoidance of using material attainments in their religious life. Some more complicated forms of architecture, equipment, and literacy were disapproved of, even when these things were allowed by and were well known from neighbouring nations. Religious life was concentrated on verbal tradition, with singing and perhaps with some elements of mystery theatre. Material forms of this life were closely connected with unsophisticated wooden shrines, nature objects ( such as trees and stones), and special ornamented vestments and their accessories.

The Lithuanian nation began to form in about 7th – 8th centuries CE. The growing difference between Western and Eastern Balts was a result of some cultural modernization of the Eastern Balts even before this period. Differences also grew between northern and southern parts of the Eastern Balts. Lithuanians derived from the southern parts of Eastern Balts till 9th century CE. At this time, the Eastern Balts did not form any political unit. They were divided into some autonomous clans, but culturally and religiously, they were part of the Balts. The common name for them, Lithuanians, was already known.

Historians have occasionally attributed the name ""Lithuania"" of this period only to one of the Eastern Balts' tribes. It is not known for certain in what political circumstances Lithuanians acquired their common name, and whether it took place before the beginning of the 11th century, when the name was first mentioned in written sources, or later.

Traditionally, historians consider religion-based union of the Balts. This theory is supported by historical sources that wrote about existence of centers of religious life (named Romuva, using  the present-day variant of this word), concentrated around more significant shrines, holy and mystic areas. Servants of these religious centers have influences on other not central shrines. This influence was based more on authority than on formal structure of organization. Finally, there is some historical data about the main religious center of all Balts. The level of organization and extent of this religious cooperation are under discussion. 
For example, some historians argue that union was more local and included only southern Balts (Lithuanians and Prussians), but Northern Balts (ancestors of Latvians) did not participate in it. Information concerning religious unity is influenced by later Lithuanian and Latvian myths and is not strongly based on historical sources and archaeological research.

The new point of distinguishing the Balts' nations and their cultural development was the occupation of a significant part of the land by Catholic military orders in the 13th century. The main areas of Western Balts, known under the name of Prussia, were occupied by Teutonic order. Livonian order occupied northern territories, beginning from areas around the Gulf of Riga, creating so-called Livonia.

Therefore, later cultural development of these two and the third unoccupied part of Balts' areas was different. Old Prussians (Balts) never regained a nation, but the Latvian nation was formed in Livonia. The third unoccupied part was a basis for the Lithuanian nation to form.

Outer aggression forced Baltic nations to form more strict institutions of political life. A Lithuanian state, Lithuania, was founded in 13th century and it included regions of still unoccupied Eastern Balts and remaining Western Balts' areas (These Western Balts' ethnic groups are known under names of Yotvingians and Sudovians).

In the middle of the 14th century, Lithuania emerged as a large eastern European state, with former Kievan Rus' and some Ruthenian regions to the north of it (approximately present Belarus) included. This expansion shows a great political potential of the Lithuanian ruling classes, and this potential could not be reached without respective cultural basis. Christian Ruthenian rulers became some kind of vassals of non-Christian Lithuanian rulers, but culturally the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (G.D.L.) remained bipolar. It consisted of a non-Christian Lithuanian part in North-West (later known as Lithuania Propria) and Eastern Christian Orthodox Ruthenian regions (partial Duchies).

The price of cooperation and recognition of pagan dominance by Ruthenian Orthodoxes in G.D.L. was recognition of wide cultural rights for orthodoxes. These rights included, for example, customs, that Lithuanian dukes had to be christened before taking office in a partial duchy in orthodox parts. Wives of Lithuanian dukes, if they were Ruthenians, stayed orthodox, but Grand Dukes in this case had to ensure that it was possible for his wife to perform orthodox rites and take part in orthodox services. Children of orthodox duchesses officially became observers of their father's religion, the old-Lithuanian one in that case. In reality, the religion of the mother could have some (sometimes great) influence.

In this period, both nations of G.D.L. insistently stood on their cultural basis, and the main directions of Lithuanian culture remained unchanged until Christianization. Lithuanian culture stayed far from growing significant literacy in Europe and there were no significant changes, for example, in cult architecture. However, there were some new tendencies too. Religious intolerance, hardly avoidable during religiously-based war as with crusaders, was offset by tolerance to orthodox Christians, so the Lithuanian community stayed tolerant in the cultural and religious sense. There were some attempts to modernize Lithuanian religious life too. For example, there were at least two Christian churches, Catholic and orthodox, both of brick stonework, in Vilnius town. The main shrine of the old-religion in the town was bricked, and not wooden as it was customary.

The cultural background of formation and persistence of higher estates before Christianization is almost unknown. Christianization of Lithuania brought changes towards European feudalism of the 15th century. It is logical that  Lithuanian political culture had some influence of Western European and, especially, Ruthenian feudalism before Christianization, but the christening broke the isolation barrier and the influence became more direct.

Adding to this, the strengthening of Western cultural constituent by Christianization mostly affected political culture. For example, this situation caused interesting effects on jurisprudence. Presence of old Ruthenian legal norms and old Lithuanian traditions as well as coming of Western European legal norms raised various inconveniences, and, in the beginning of the 16th century, the Lithuanian law codex, the First Statute of Lithuania of 1529  was issued. Lithuanian law was exercised in the territory of G.D.L. till 1840, survived not only times of state independence before Union of Lublin of 1569, but the state itself. Thus, since its beginning, Lithuanian law became one of the factors of political integrity of G.D.L. and distinguished Lithuania from other European regions including The Crown of the Polish Kingdom.

The issuance of the codex is an illustration of two different tendencies in the political elite of G.D.L. The issuance of a written law codex shows a significant western influence on Lithuanian political culture of this time. However, the existence of a Lithuanian system of law shows that cultural differences from Western Europe existed and were acknowledged by ruling classes.

In this time, Lithuanians were getting acquainted with Western European culture and this process had interesting discoveries, which also caused later ruling political ideas. However,  the process was not trivial. To become ""educated in aristocratic manner"" a Lithuanian had to learn at least three languages: Ruthenian, Polish and Latin. German with variety of its dialects and Italian were also used. In reality, this educational objective could not usually be realised, so knowledge of languages (and even cultural orientation) depended on estate of person. Priests and humanitarians learned Latin, merchants learnt German. Polish was preferred by the upper classes, but Ruthenian by the lower strata of nobles.

Since the end of the 14th century, Lithuanians began to study in universities abroad, mostly in Kraków and Prague Universities and, sometimes, in Western European ones. Latin, being a church and humanitarian language, was studied by a number of Lithuanian citizens, mostly Catholics. Latin had a specific reason to be considered interesting for Lithuanian-speaking Lithuanians. Being acquainted with Latin language, Lithuanian humanitarians discovered great similarities between a large number of Lithuanian and Latin words, such as (Lithuanian words are given in their modern form) aušra – aurora (a dawn), dūmas – fumus (fume, smoke), mėnesis – mensis (a month), senis – senex (an old man) and so on. This paradoxical similarity was explained by raising an idea that Lithuanian was directly derived from Latin.

This idea, joined with one, maybe earlier, myth about modernized cultural hero Palemon, treating him as a Latin language pioneer in earlier pre-Christian Lithuania, has a great influence to the political mindset of noble Lithuanians. It constricted an area of Lithuanian cultural independence, prescribing to Lithuanians affinity with Italics and showing Lithuanian culture as secondary, derivative and mixed. On the other hand, it stimulated patriotism, arguing that Lithuanian popular culture is more ""Latin"" than Polish and German cultures, so more cultured according to the thinking of that time. This theory raised the prestige of old Lithuania (thought of by neighbors as ""pagan"" and ""barbarian"") firstly in the eyes of Lithuanians themselves, and had the same effect on foreign people (especially Poles, who often treated their mediating in Lithuania's Christianization as their own cultural achievement against ""eastern"" or ""pagan"" ""barbarism"").

Despite using the existence of Lithuanian as a patriotic argument, the usage of the language itself became more and more narrow among the higher strata of nobles. Ruthenian became official after the Christianization, for it had more developed written tradition and, maybe, because of negative attitude of Orthodox nobles towards Lithuanian. During the 15th century, Ruthenian became anchored more in all machinery of the state. As it was common European tendency of the 15th to 17th centuries to make the transition from feudalism to bigger state dominance, the role of the state grew, and prestige of Lithuanian decreased. Documents of Lithuanian law were written in Ruthenian, and it looked normal. Usage of Ruthenian however never reached amounts of official language usage in modern sense, and stayed comparable with usage of Latin in medieval Europe.

On the other hand, not only Ruthenian, but Latin and Polish also narrowed the use of Lithuanian. The Great Duke of Lithuania (later, also the king of Poland) Alexander (as the Great Duke reigned 1492–1506) was taught ""Lithuanian"". Even if ""Lithuanian"" does not mean ""Ruthenian"", Alexander would have been the last Great Duke who knew Lithuanian.

The loss of ethnic basis did not reduce patriotism among nobles. The variegate Lithuanian mythology of this time (legend about emigration of Palemon from Rome to Lithuania, legend about the founding of the capital of Lithuania Vilnius by Duke Gediminas, and other pieces) had been presented in a spirit of high lucid and virtuous patriotism.

Original architectural style (with Western-European and Byzantine tendencies fused in it) and other manifestations of material culture of this time prove Lithuania as a distinctive cultural unit. However, Lithuania was too little known to Western Europeans in these times.

The Protestant Reformation was met differently by different strata of Lithuanians. Ruling classes entered into the Reformation struggles both on pro and contra sides. Urban people in the biggest towns, especially in the Catholic part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania (G.D.L.), were involved in these struggles too, mostly as clients of some persons of influence in the highest stratum. Ordinary  people of towns  played a role of believers in both Catholic and Protestant churches. From the mid 16th century until the end of the Reformation, sporadic street scuffles between Catholic and Protestant hotheads were often found in these towns. However even in the time of the religious struggle, some partial tolerance existed, and both involved sides proclaimed their abstinence from solving the question in the form of violence. The scuffles always were restricted by officials and they never grew into military conflicts or massacre.

The answer of ordinary country people to the Reformation was their return to ""paganism"". After some stabilization, both Catholic Jesuits in G.D.L. and Protestant priests in Prussia describe the situation such, as if Lithuania was christened not before 250 years, but still before the events. It seems likely that both sources described this situation so emphatically in order to simulate bigger merits in rechristening. But it also points out that ""pagan"" tendencies still existed not only in a subconscious form, but also in performing rites. Besides to it, Christian life had to remain in some forms in country-regions too.

It must also be emphasized that the eastern part of G.D.L. stayed orthodox and orthodox culture had its broad cultural life. The same can be said about Jewish, Tatar and Karait minorities in G.D.L. And all these facts show how variegated and different-sided the cultural situation in Lithuania was.

Adding to this, there were some tendencies in cultural life of G.D.L. not directly connected with religious problems on Reformation background. In the first place, absorption of ideas of Western cultural development in 13th – 16th centuries by nobles (especially, urban ones).  Italian cultural ideas of Rinascemento had an especially big influence. They were reflected on literature (written mostly in Latin or Polish, or, in case of orthodox, in Ruthenian).

The main reasons for such exceptional thoughts of Italy were conservatism of Lithuanians and position of the Royal court. All facts showed Italy to Lithuanians as a country of ancient and high culture. Additionally, the Queen of Poland wife of Sigismund I Bona was Italian. Thus despite the growth of Reformation, the cultural orientation hadn't changed.

The Reformation in Lithuania remained on the level of political and religious regulating ideas and didn't turn into a cultural movement as it did in West European countries. disputes about the Reformation were in the form of peaceful verbal discussion among the highest estate of the country. And in these discussions, the Latin language, eloquence, citation and knowledge of ancient philosophers referred more to Italy than to any other country of Western Europe.

In this atmosphere Catholics decided to use this cultural attachment to improve their position. Their leaders decided to found a unit of Jesuit order in Lithuania (Jesuits were known as masters of discussion and providers of a modernized Latin-based scholastic education). In their turn Jesuits founded the University of Vilnius (officially 1579). Students and graduates of the University soon became true supporters of the Catholic Church.

These events caused the wave of Reformation to fall. With the decrees of Reformation aspirations in the higher strata, activity of reformers among the rest of the urban population was more and more restricted by officials.  Thus after the middle of the 17th century, the non-Orthodox part of Lithuania became firmly Catholic (with a Protestant minorities in some towns like Vilnius, Kėdainiai, and Biržai).

Another cultural factor, not connected with the reformation directly, was printing of books. The first printed books reached Lithuania before the beginning of the Reformation. But multiplied religious discussions and the increase of printing in Western Europe both activated interest in printing books in Lithuania. The first book in Lithuanian was printed in 1547  in Königsberg (it was a Protestant Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas). The first typography in G.D.L. was opened in approx. 1575 in Vilnius.

Presence of printed books became the signal factor to change ancient Lithuanian cultural attitude against literacy. The necessity of literacy became evident. But in G.D.L. at the same time the growing of literacy coincided with refusal of Lithuanian culture among the nobility.

Lithuanian-language culture derived directly from old Lithuanian culture, among lower strata prevalently.  The language barrier  caused it to remain isolated from innovations in culture in the 15th century. However the Christianity of higher estates and presence of Christian parishes even in country regions weakened a base of old religion and induced some non direct changes towards culture, based on common European values.

The higher strata in Lithuania for unknown reasons accepted innovations in culture directly, without any attempts at inculturation or adaptation to local cultural thinking. It meant accepting of extraneous culture in all its complexity, with using new language and so on. So, old Lithuanian culture (or, as a later form, Lithuanian-language culture) was negated and rejected by a part of the population in Lithuanian part of G.D.L., especially by the highest estates since approx. middle 15th century. This situation became a serious impediment to Lithuanian-language culture. Lithuanians of lower estates could not become acquainted with European Christian culture, but their peculiar cultural life was strongly slowed too. So all later facts of Lithuanian cultural life till the middle of the 19th century were more or less sporadic.

National Lithuanian culture did not become a factor of unification of Lithuanian elite during this period. Christianity was declared then as such a factor, but different European cultural influences made this idea complex. There were followers of Polish, German, Italian cultures, and Protestants and Catholics contested  in Lithuania in that time. And both orthodoxes and Jews, even if they stayed a bit in a side, contributed to all this variety.  - But this situation saved Lithuanian-language culture as well. Being strictly negated, it also did not have clear directions of change and stayed original. In its turn this having no direction was dangerous for self-isolation and remaining stagnate without creative flight.

When the Catholic Church (or the Lutheran one, if we speak about Lithuanians in Prussia) became a provider of new ideas for Lithuanian people, it became something like a window to the extraneous world. It's a question how much this role was accepted voluntary by the church. Some historians argue that it was made by pressure of rivalry between Catholics and Protestants and it weakened when Reformation struggles decreased.

At any rate, the other, opposite to negating Lithuanian culture, tendency had its supporters too. Even more, these two tendencies, the inculturating and the negating one, remained as two main components in Lithuanian culture till the beginning of the 19th century and have their evident consequences now.

Changes of old Lithuanian culture became mostly evident in a sphere of religion. We know only approximately what new elements had been introduced into (old) Lithuanian culture, clothing and so on in the beginning of this period. But the popular-kind simplifying   (or becoming more rustic) of old Lithuanian religion is an unquestioned thing. The ritual became strictly connected with the calendar of rural works and other factors of this kind; witnesses of that time found a multitude of sacred objects (they simply described them as ""gods""), which were connected totally with all material life, but didn't refer to more philosophically common or abstract ideas (in opposition to descriptions of religion in the 14th century). It allows us to think about some form of pantheism, as if all the world was holy for Lithuanians.

This old vision of the world retreated slowly and finally was extinguished  in the end of the 18th century. There were two stages of this process. Firstly the extinguishing of original attributes of the old religion, as names, forms of rite, details of clothing, and especially words of holy prayers, songs and poems. All these traditional forms still had some existence in the 16th century, but they became less and less known a century later. And we can date the beginning of the new stage approximately to the last quarter of the 16th century.

Two other processes started in this time. The first was stabilization of some old cultural forms, maybe less confronting to Christian requirements. Later, some of them survived the time of the very understanding old culture values and became known by neighboring nations as Lithuanian popular traditions  since the middle of the 19th century or sporadically even earlier. The traditional popular songs (dainos) and Lithuanian woven sashes (juostos) are among them. Lithuanians began to create the songs in these times instead of forgotten or forbidden old holy songs and prayers. The melodic base of dainos, especially in the very beginning, was the same as in these songs. Juostos had been woven by women since old times. During this period they became the main ware, in which traditional Lithuanian ornaments still were used. The ornaments may have had some conventional symbolic significance, but during this period they began  to be   seen only as forms of art, which later developed into a standard of Lithuanian popular art.

The second process, which took place after the end of the 16th century, was introduction of ideas of Christianity into the Lithuanian environment, using Lithuanian culture's symbols and traditions. This program was initiated by Jesuits (in G.D.L. only). The worship of various old religion holy essences was changed into cult of saints. On the other hand, traditional Catholic art forms of sacred objects were supplemented in Lithuania by some forms, which were comparable with ones, taken from old Lithuanian art ware. As the best example, traditional (both iron and wooden) crosses in present Lithuania, West Belarus and Northern Poland with raying sun and moon could be noted. In this case we can see old symbols still having symbolic (maybe different from pre-Christian times) sense too. 
During this period, new forms were added to country art. Local craftsmen made (mostly wooden) statues of saints, chapels, wooden an iron crosses (statues and chapels often had well-seen prototypes, made by famous European artists, but there were also original ones). Till the 19th century it became a significant branch of Lithuanian country art, known and used also by urban people.

This program of inculturation required a good knowledge of Lithuanian. The superiors of Jesuits in Lithuania always paid some (though not very big) attention to it. The time after founding Jesuits in Lithuania was exceptional in this point. The rivalry with Reformers and, maybe, more direct survey from Rome caused, that attention, paid to Lithuanian by Jesuits was greater, than before or after it. Jesuit Lithuanian Daukša even wrote a manifesto (printed in his Postil, a collection of sermons in Lithuanian, in 1599), in which he exhorted Lithuanian nobles to regard and to use Lithuanian. Twenty years later the first dictionary with Lithuanian words was published (Polish–Latin–Lithuanian dictionary by Jesuit priest  Konstantinas Sirvydas, in approx. 1620) and it became a significant fact of Lithuanian cultural life. The dictionary had a big influence to the development of Lithuanian, especially to its standardization and modernization. Adding to this, Lithuanian was presented in a satisfactory form in the dictionary, with borrowings forming only a small part of the entire word corpus. And it meant not only a difference of Lithuanian-language culture from others, but also a big potential of this culture.

So the short period during which Lithuanian-language culture was fostered by the Society of Jesus had positive effects.

After the middle of the 17th century, a moderate rise of Lithuanian-speaking culture took place. Politically it was the time of turmoils and wars. Despite this, towns were growing in Lithuania and various new realities came into life. The number of urban people increased and newcomers (in much cases Lithuanian-speaking) had significant input to it. The degree of communication between state and town officials and ordinary inhabitants increased as well. This development caused necessary changes in language policy. In non-orthodox regions of G.D.L. the middle and lower strata of urban people used Lithuanian. And only some regions in the South of G.D.L. as Grodna, Augustów regions and Vilnius town (not region) were exceptions to it, having however Lithuanian-speaking population parts, mostly in lower strata. This situation caused it to be necessary for the highest stratum of nobles to know Lithuanian too. The prestige of Lithuanian was increasing at this time and we can speak about some relative expansion and renovation of Lithuanian-speaking culture.

Lithuanian didn't gain official status then. Among various causes of it, some more significant must be emphasized. Firstly, the two biggest towns in G.D.L. were polonized earlier and more than other towns. Secondly, position of Catholic church in G.D.L. was favorable to Polish. Adding to this, whereas publishing of books was sponsored by the highest nobles and by Catholic and Orthodox churches, publishing of books in Lithuanian did not increase. Lithuanian-language books became more and more inconspicuous among Polish and Latin publications.

As a result, the Lithuanian-speaking culture did not expand among the highest nobles. But some positive changes took place in this time too. The language was modernized, it was no longer a language of mere country people. Style of courtesy re-appeared in the language (some style of this kind had to exist in pre-Christian Lithuania). All this contributed to the existence of a Lithuanian-speaking culture among further generations of nobles and urban people. And these processes, going on only on a part of the territory of G.D.L., were a sign of a growing modern Lithuania.

Lithuanians, mostly villagers, lived in the North and North-East regions of the Duchy of Prussia. This fact was confirmed later in administrative way, and administrative unit, called Lithuanian counties was created. Unofficially it was called Lithuania, Prussian Lithuania, or, in later times, also Lithuania Minor. In the beginning of the 16th century, Lithuanians in Prussia had the same cultural traditions as neighboring Lithuanians in G.D.L., and some inessential differences are not worth mentioning here.

But later the cultural difference between Prussian Lithuania and Lithuanian part of G.D.L. increased. The main points of this process were: In 1530, Prussia became a secular Protestant state. So Prussian Lithuanians became Protestants (Lutherans), while Lithuanians in G.D.L. stayed Catholics. The next point was presence of some official attention to religious education in the native language in Prussia. At the beginning, after 1530, for this purpose the first secular ruler of Prussia, the duke Albert invited a number of educated Lithuanians Protestants from G.D.L. They became senior priests in Prussian Lithuania and authors of church texts, holy songs in Lithuanian and their translations into Lithuanian, but one of them, Martynas Mažvydas, wrote a catechism, which was published in 1547  in Königsberg, becoming the first printed book in Lithuanian.

Since this time priests of Lithuanian parishes were obliged to know Lithuanian and they did this obligation more or less. There were talented persons among them, and sometimes books in Lithuanian with new translations of religious texts, new holy songs and so on were published. In 1653 the first Lithuanian grammar, Grammatica Litvanica by Daniel Klein, was issued in  Königsberg. And unpublished material on Lithuanian language and culture, collected by them, was big too.

The interest of Lutheran priests of Prussian Lithuanian parishes in Lithuanian was deeper than the interest of their Catholic colleagues in G.D.L., and they managed to print more books for a relatively small Lithuanian population in Prussia, than Catholic editors for all Lithuanian population in G.D.L.

Catholic priests paid less attention towards Lithuanian popular traditions than Lutheran ones. Also the existence of G.D.L. had some influence to Prussian ruling persons and even put some pressure on them, and it did not allow disregarding of existing Lithuanians and their cultural needs. And the situation of Lithuanians was better, than, for example, the Old Prussian population, whose language was called ""barbarian"" and attained only minimal attention.

Despite good attention to Lithuanian, Lithuanians were not admitted to the Prussian ruling class, which remained German. And the church career was the only one available for Lithuanians. Concentration of Lithuanian intellectuals in priest estate had some significant consequences. Lithuanian remained in use in Prussian Lithuania till the beginning of the 20th century and later. Besides this, Lithuanians became loyal and faithful to Evangelical Church in Prussia and Protestantism, their faith assumed some forms of pietism. And, in its turn, they became loyal and devoted subjects and patriots of Prussia. Thus, in fact, this part of the Lithuanian nation was separated from the main part in G.D.L. during this period.

The later part of Middle Christian period from the end of the 17th century to the mid-19th century suffered a period of decline for the Grand duchy of Lithuania.

The table below contains the main historical events connected with cultural life in Lithuania in the 18th to 20th centuries.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lithuanian_culture
History of Poles in Lithuania,"The history of Poles in Lithuania describes the history of Polish culture and language in Lithuanian lands, as well as the process of formation in the Polish community there before 1990.

During the Polish–Lithuanian union, there was an influx of Poles into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the gradual Polonization of its elite and upper classes. At the end of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, almost all of Lithuania's nobility, clergy, and townspeople spoke Polish and adopted Polish culture, while still maintaining a Lithuanian identity.[1] In the late 19th century, due to the processes of Polonization of Lithuanian and Belarusian peasants Polish population lived mainly on a long strip of land, stretching to Daugavpils and including Vilnius. The rise of the Lithuanian national movement led to conflicts between both groups. Following World War I and the rebirth of both states, there was the Polish–Lithuanian War, whose main focus was Vilnius and the nearby region. In its aftermath, the majority of the Polish population living in the Lithuanian lands found themselves within the Polish borders. However, interwar Lithuania still retained a large Polish minority. During World War II, the Polish population was persecuted by the USSR and Nazi Germany. Post-World War II, the borders were changed, territorial disputes were suppressed as the Soviet Union exercised power over both countries and a significant part of the Polish population, especially the best-educated, was forcefully transferred from the Lithuanian SSR to the Polish People's Republic. At the same time, a significant number of Poles relocated from nearby regions of Byelorussian SSR to Vilnius and Vilnius region.

Currently, the Polish population is grouped in the Vilnius region, primarily the Vilnius and Šalčininkai districts. In the city of Vilnius alone there are more than 85,000 Poles, who make up about 15% of the Lithuanian capital's population. Most Poles in Lithuania are Roman Catholic and speak Polish, although a minority of them speak Russian or Lithuanian, as their first language.

The first Poles appeared in Lithuania long before the Union of Krewo in 1385.[2] The early Polish population was composed mainly of enslaved war captives[3][a] who assimilated relatively quickly.[5] The Lithuanian slave raids into Poland continued until the second half of the 14th century.[6] The process of voluntary Polish migration began in the mid-13th century,[5] nonetheless Poles did not start to migrate to Lithuania in more noticeable numbers until Christianization of the country.[5][7]

Between 1387 and 1569, members of various Polish social strata (i.e. burghers, clergy, merchants, and szlachta) moved to Lithuania, although this migration was not large-scale. The Poles settled mainly in urban centers, on Catholic church grounds, and concentrated at aristocratic courts.[2] Many Poles worked in the Grand Ducal latin chancellery. Mikołaj Cebulka was appointed the senior secretary by Vytautas.[2] Klemens Moskarzewski [pl] was the starosta of Vilnius and a commander during the city's successful defence in 1390, when it was besieged by Vytautas and Teutonic Knights.[9] In the same year, Jaśko from Oleśnica became the governor of Lithuania on behalf of king Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila).[10] Another Pole, Mikołaj Sapieński, participated in the Council of Constance as one of three leaders of the Samogitian delegation.[2]

By the end of the 15th century, several Polish families from Podlachia were included in the governing elite[b] of the Grand Duchy.[11] In the 15th and 16th century, the Polish population in Lithuania was not large numerically, but the Poles enjoyed a privileged social position – they were found in highly regarded places and their culture was considered prestigious.[7] With time Polish people became also part of the local landowning class.[2][12][c] A relocation of a Polish noble to the Grand Duchy tended to trigger a chain of further arrivals, often motivated by family ties or geographic links.[14] Lithuanian nobles welcomed fugitive Polish peasants and settled them on uncultivated land, but they usually assimilated with Belarusians and Lithuanians peasants within few generations.[5][15] Polish peasants took also part in the colonization of the Neman river area.[16] In the 16th century, the largest concentrations of Poles in the GDL were located in Podlachia[d] the border areas of Samogitia, Lithuania and Belarus, and the cities of Vilnius, Brest, Kaunas, Grodno, Kėdainiai, and Nyasvizh.[23]

As a result of the Union of Krewo, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania found itself drawn towards cultural and political orbit of the Kingdom of Poland. Polish quickly supplanted Ruthenian as the language of Lithuanian elite after the latter had switched to speaking Ruthenian and Polish at the beginning of the 16th century.[7] In the 16th century, the royal and grand ducal courts were nearly entirely composed of Polish speakers.[24] The numbers of Poles in Lithuania were additionally augmented by the almost constant (since the mid-16th century) stationing of Polish military.[25][e] Around 1552, Kalisz Chamberlain Piotr Chwalczewski became administrator of Lithuania's royal castles and estates. Since 1558, he was also responsible for coordination of the agrarian reform which was implemented by specialists brought from Poland.[2] Reformation gave another impetus to the spread of Polish, as the Bible and other religious texts were translated from Latin to Polish. Since the second half of the 16th century, Poles predominated in Protestant schools and printing houses in Lithuania, and the life of local protestant congregations.[26]

After the Union of Lublin, the influx of Poles to the Grand Duchy significantly increased,[27] particularly nobles from Masovia and Lesser Poland. This population movement created a fertile ground for socio-cultural Polonization of Lithuania.[28] Poor nobles from the Crown rented land from local magnates.[29] The number of Poles grew also in the towns, among others in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Grodno.[30] There were numerous Poles among the Jesuits residing in Lithuania, including such prominent figures like Piotr Skarga (1536–1612),[31] the first rector of the University of Vilnius,[32] Jakub Wujek (1541–1597), and Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595–1640).[31] From 1397 to the 16th century, the Chapter of Vilnius numbered 123 Canons, of whom 90 were from the Crown and Podlachia, and 33 or more were Lithuanians.[20]

While Poles and foreigners were generally prohibited from holding public offices in the Grand Duchy, Polish people gradually gained this right through the acquisition of Lithuanian land. For example, Mikołaj Radzimiński [pl] (c. 1585–c. 1630) became a Marshal of Lithuanian Tribunal and the Starosta of Mstsislaw, Piotr Wiesiołowski [pl] was the Grand Marshal of Lithuania (nominated in 1615), Janusz Lacki (d. 1646) was Vilnius Chamberlain, Minsk Castellan, and the General Starosta of Samogitia (in 1643–1646).[33]

Already at the beginning of the 16th century Polish became the first language of the Lithuanian magnates. In the following century it was adopted by the Lithuanian nobility in general. Even the nobility of Žemaitija used the Polish language already in the 17th century.[34] At the beginning of the 18th century, the Polish language was adopted by the entire nobility of the Grand Duchy – Lithuanian, Ruthenian, German and Tatar.[35] The Polish language also penetrated other social strata: the clergy, the townspeople, and even the peasants.[36]
During the Commonwealth's period, a Polish-dominated territory started to be slowly formed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,[5] such as Liauda, northeast of Kaunas (since the early 15th century). According to the Polish historian Barbara Topolska [pl], by the mid-17th century, Poles made up several percent of the total population in the Grand Duchy.[11] The Polish historian Władysław Wielhorski [pl] estimated that by the end of the 18th century, Polish and Polonized people constituted 25% of the Grand Duchy's inhabitants.[5]

The influx of Polish population to Vilnius started in the late 14th century.[37] Vilnius was also the only place in present-day Lithuania where, in the 15th century, an ethnically restricted community of Poles was established. Another one, more numerous, was likely created  in the area of present-day Belarus.[2] The city became the most important center of the Polish intelligentsia in the Grand Duchy.[38] In the 16th century, Poles constituted 40% of all professors at Vilnius Academy, in the 17th century – 60%, and they were 30% of the teaching cadre in the 18th century.[39] Ethnic Poles made up around 50% of Vilnius urban officials during the Baroque period,[40] and by the 17th century the city became culturally Polish.[41] Poles were the predominant population in Vilnius in the middle of the 17th century.[42] In 1785, Wojciech Bogusławski, who is considered the ""father"" of Polish theatre, opened the first public theatre in Vilnius.[43]

Until the 1830s, Polish was used for the administrative purposes in the so called Western Krai area, which included the Grand Duchy's lands annexed by the Russian Empire in the partitions of the Commonwealth.[45] During the 19th century, Poles were the largest Christian nationality in Vilnius. They also predominated in the municipal government of the city in the earlier half of the 19th century.[46] The Polish-language university was re-established in Vilnius in 1803 and closed in 1832.[47] After the 1863 uprising, the Russian law prohibited public use of the Polish language and teaching it to peasants, as well as possession of Polish books by the latter.[48][49] The members of szlachta class, notwithstanding their varied ethnic roots, generally opted for Polish self-identification in the course of the 19th century.[50]

In the 19th century Polish culture was spreading among the lower classes of Lithuania, [51] mainly in Dzūkija and to a lesser degree in Aukštaitija. A complicated linguistic situation developed on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Polish speakers used a ""Kresy"" variant of Polish (Northern Borderlands dialect) that retained archaic Polish features as well as many remnants of Belarusian and some features of Lithuanian.[52] Linguists distinguish between official language, used in the Church and cultural activities, and colloquial language, closer to the speech of the common people. Inhabitants of a significant part of the Vilnius region used a variant of the Belarusian language, which was influenced mainly by Polish, but also by Lithuanian, Russian and Jewish. This language was referred to as ""simple speech"" (Polish: mowa prosta), and was treated by many as a dialect variety of Polish. In fact, it was a kind of ""mixed language"" serving as an interdialect of the cultural borderland.[53] This language became a gateway to the progressive Slavization of the Lithuanian population. The knowledge of Slavonic interdialect made it easier for Lithuanians to communicate with their Slavic neighbors, who spoke Polish, Russian, or Belarusian. The attractiveness and cultural prestige of the Polish language and its common use in church caused the process to continue and lead to the full adoption of the Polish language. Among the Belarusian population, the usage of Polish was limited to official relations, while at home, the local language was still spoken.[54] As a result, the Lithuanian language retreated under the pressure of Polish faster than Belarusian. This led to the formation of a compact Polish language area between the Lithuanian and Belarusian language areas, with Vilnius as the center.[55] The position of Vilnius as an important Polish cultural center influenced the development of national identities among Roman Catholic peasants in the region.[56] A significant part of the population of the Polish–Lithuanian–Belarusian borderlands for a long time did not have a clearly declared nationality and described themselves as ""locals"" (tutejszy). The Slavic speakers inhabiting the area around Vilnius consistently chose Polish nationality in all the censuses conducted after the end of the 19th century.[57]

The emergence of the Lithuanian national movement in the 1880s slowed down the process of Polonization of the ethnically Lithuanian population, but also cemented a sense of national identity among a significant portion of the Polish-speaking Lithuanian population. The feeling of a two-tier Lithuanian-Polish national identity, present throughout the period, had to give way to a clear national declaration. Previously, every inhabitant of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been considered a Lithuanian, but in the face of the emergence of the Lithuanian national movement, which considered only those who spoke Lithuanian as Lithuanians, Polish-speaking residents of Lithuania more and more often declared themselves as Poles.[58] The dispute over the auxiliary language of services (Polish or Lithuanian) in the churches on the eastern border of ethnic Lithuania, which heated up from the end of the nineteenth century, influenced the formation of Polish consciousness and the adoption of the Polish language among those believers whose ancestors had abandoned Lithuanian for plain speech.[59]

By the time of the Polish–Lithuanian war, Poles made up also almost all of the local aristocracy and richer landowners in Vilnius and its surroundings.[60] Most descendants of the Lithuanian noble class opposed the Belarusian and Lithuanian national revivals and fought for Poland in 1918–1920.[61] From 1918 to 1921 there were several conflicts, such as the activity of the Polish Military Organisation, Sejny uprising and a foiled attempt at a Polish coup of the Lithuanian government.[62][63] As a result of the Polish-Lithuanian war and Żeligowski's mutiny the border between independent Lithuania and Poland was drawn more or less according to the linguistic division of the region. Nevertheless, many Poles lived in the Lithuanian state and a significant Lithuanian minority found itself within the Polish borders. The loss of Vilnius was a painful blow to Lithuanian aspirations and identity. The irredentist demand for its recovery became one of the most important elements of socio-political life in interwar Lithuania and resulted in the emergence of hostility and resentment against the Poles.[64]

In interwar Lithuania, people declaring Polish ethnicity were officially described as Polonized Lithuanians who needed to be re-Lithuanized, Polish-owned land was confiscated, Polish religious services, schools, publications and voting rights were restricted.[65] According to the Lithuanian census of 1923 (not including Vilnius and Klaipėda regions), there were 65,600 Poles in Lithuania (3.2% of the total population).[66] Although according to Polish Election Committee in fact the number of Poles was 202,026, so about 10% of total population.[67] This number was based on election results.[68] The Poles were concentrated in the districts of Kaunas, Kėdainiai, Kaišiadorys and Ukmergė, in each of which they constituted 20–30% of the population.[69]

The Polish Parliamentary Faction numbered three deputies after 1921 elections (Bronisław Laus, Adolf Grajewski and Józef Śnielewski), four deputies after the 1923 elections (Wiktor Budzyński, Bolesław Lutyk, Wincenty Rumpel and Kazimierz Wołkowycki) and four again after 1926 elections (Jan Bucewicz, Wiktor Budzyński, Tomasz Giżyński and Bolesław Lutyk). However, their possibilities for action were limited, because, like all minority representatives, they were excluded from parliamentary committees.[70]

In 1919, Poles owned 90% of estates larger than 100 ha. By 1928, 2,997 large estates with a total area of 555,207 ha were parceled out, and 52,935 new farms were created in their place and given to Lithuanian peasants. A large part of Polish landowners who were deprived of their property left Lithuania.[71]

Many Poles in Lithuania were signed in as Lithuanians in their passports, and as a result, they also were forced to attend Lithuanian schools. Polish education was organized by the Association for the Promotion of Culture and Education among Poles in Lithuania ""Pochodnia"". While the number of Polish-language schools in Lithuania increased from 20 to 30 from 1920 to 1923,[73] and to 78 in 1926,[74] then decreased to 9 by 1940.[73] After the establishment of Valdemaras regime in 1926, 58[74] Polish schools were closed, many Poles were incarcerated, and Polish newspapers were placed under strict censorship.[75] All national minorities in Lithuania were excluded from studying medicine in the country. And at the Pedagogical Institute of the Republic in Klaipėda Poles were subject to numerus clausus. At other universities Poles were not restricted and in 1929 there were about 150 Polish students in Lithuania. Most Poles chose to study abroad. In 1928, the Union of Polish Academic Youth of Lithuania (ZPAML) was founded.[76] As a result of the introduction of a new restrictive law on associations, ZPMAL ended its activities at the end of 1938, along with 14 other Polish organizations.[77]

There were six Polish periodicals in Lithuania, including the most important daily ""Dzień Kowieński"" (later ""Dzień Polski""). They were subject to censorship and numerous restrictions.[78] Over time, the Polish language was also removed from the Church. Since 1929, there has been no teaching of the Polish language at the Kaunas Seminary. Polish priests were transferred to parishes with a majority of Lithuanian believers. Services in Polish were often interrupted by Lithuanian nationalists. This situation intensified especially in the first half of 1924 in Kaunas, when masses were drowned out and the faithful beaten. These situations occurred in most towns where Poles constituted a significant percentage.[79] As a result, just before the war there were only 2 Polish priests working in Lithuania, and only in a few parishes masses were celebrated partially in Polish.[80] The most tragic episode in the history of Poles in interwar Lithuania was an anti-Polish demonstration organized by the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union on 23 May 1930 in Kaunas, which turned into a riot. Seats of Polish organizations, editorial offices, Polish schools and a Polish gymnasium were demolished.[81]

Politically, Polish circles were divided into two groups. The first derived from the traditions of the Krajowcy group and was based on loyalty to the Lithuanians. They were concentrated around the Polish Central Committee in Kaunas. The second group, composed mainly of young people, mainly academic youth, pushed a more nationalist stance, intensified by the repressive policies of the state. This second group was supported by Warsaw and concentrated around the ZPMAL. In 1937 a conflict broke out between the youth leader Tomasz Surwiłło and Alfons Bojko, the editor-in-chief of the ""Chata Rodzinna"" (""Family Cottage"") magazine. The former was supported by Warsaw.[82]

Poles took an active part in the social life of the country. At Kaunas University the rector was law professor Michał Römer. Włodzimierz Szyłkarski [pl] taught philosophy, Maria Arcimowiczowa taught Egyptology, Helena Szwejkowska [pl] taught Polish literature and language, and Antoni Ignacy Weryha-Darewski taught financial law.[83]

A large portion of the Vilnius area was part of the Second Polish Republic during the interwar period,[f] particularly the area of the Republic of Central Lithuania, which had a significant Polish speaking population. For example, the Wilno Voivodeship (25% of it is a part of modern Lithuania and 75% – modern Belarus) in 1931 contained 59.7% Polish speakers and only 5.2% Lithuanian speakers.[86]

During the World War II expulsions and shortly after the war, the Soviet Union, during its efforts to establish the People's Republic of Poland, forcibly exchanged population between Poland and Lithuania. During 1945–1948, the Soviet Union allowed 197,000 Poles to leave to Poland; in 1956–1959, another 46,600 were able to leave.[88][89]

Ethnic Poles made up from 80%[90] to over 91% of Vilnius population in 1944.[91] All Poles in the city were required to register for resettlement, and about 80% of them left for Poland.[92] By March 1946, around 129,000 people from Kaunas region declared their willingness to be relocated to Poland. In most cases, the Soviet authorities blocked the departure of Poles who were interwar Lithuanian citizens and only less than 8,000 of the registered (8.3%) managed to leave for Poland. In 1956–1959, around 3,000 people from Kaunas were repatriated to Poland.[93]

In the 1950s the remaining Polish minority was a target of several attempted campaigns of Lithuanization by the Communist Party of Lithuania, which tried to stop any teaching in Polish; those attempts, however, were vetoed by Moscow, which saw them as nationalistic.[94] The Soviet census of 1959 showed 230,100 Poles concentrated in the Vilnius region (8.5% of the Lithuanian SSR's population).[95] The Polish minority increased in size, but more slowly than other ethnic groups in Lithuania; the last Soviet census of 1989 showed 258,000 Poles (7.0% of the Lithuanian SSR's population).[95] The Polish minority, subject in the past to massive, often voluntary[96] Russification and Sovietization, and recently to voluntary processes of Lithuanization, shows many and increasing signs of assimilation with Lithuanians.[95]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Poles_in_Lithuania

Music of Lithuania,"Music of Lithuania refers to all forms of music associated with Lithuania, which has a long history of the folk, popular and classical musical development. Music was an important part of polytheistic, pre-Christian Lithuania – rituals were accompanied by music instruments and singing, deeds of the heroes and those who didn't return from the war were celebrated in songs.

Music was very important part of ancient Lithuanian polytheistic belief. It is known that, at the start of the 2nd millennium, Baltic tribes had special funeral traditions in which the deeds of the dead were narrated using recitation, and ritual songs about war campaigns, heroes and rulers also existed.[1]

First professional music was introduced to Lithuania with travelling monks in the 11th century. After the christianization of Lithuania in 1387, religious music started to spread, Gregorian chant was introduced. Travelling musicians arranged concerts in the manors and castles of the Lithuanian nobleman, local cappellas were founded.

It is known, that Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, wife of Vytautas the Great which had diplomatic relationships with the Teutonic Knights, who sent her expensive gifts, including clavichord and portative organ in 1408.[2] Daughter of Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, Aldona, when married to Casimir III of Poland, 1325 took her palace orchestra to Cracow.[3] It had musicians which played lute, zither and lyre.

The first opera (Dramma per musica) in Lithuania was staged in the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in 1636. Marco Scacchi and Virgilio Puccitelli were the opera's impresarios. The appearance of the opera in Lithuania is quite early, especially considering the fact that Italian opera phenomena was formed at about 1600 and first opera staged in Paris was just before 1650.

In the 17th century in Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, three Italian operas were staged – all by palace composer Marco Scacchi, to librettos by Virgilio Puccitelli - Il ratto d’Elena (The Elena Kidnapping) (1636), L'Andromeda (Andromeda) (1644), Circe Delusa (Disillusioned Circe) (1648). The scenography and stage machinery was made by Italian architects and engineers Agostino Locci, Bartolomeo Bolzoni and Giovanni Battista Gisleni. The cultural life of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania was especially intense during the reign of Sigismund II Augustus. The Vilnius residence was a place to host many chamber concerts, music and dance festivities and carnivals, and music has become an integral part of the public life of the Palace. Musicians from other countries, especially from Italy, were invited to Vilnius. Among the most notable was Hungarian composer and lutenist Bálint Bakfark, who came to Vilnius from Rome, Italian composer Diomedes Cato.[4] Composer and lutenist Michelagnolo Galilei, brother of Galileo Galilei was playing in the court of Radvila in Vilnius in the 17th century. Approximately 100 musicians worked in Vilnius at the court of Mikalojus Radvila Juodasis, the Protestant Grand Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Palatine of Vilnius (1515–1565).[5]

First printed Lithuanian book Catechismusa Prasty Szadei (The Simple Words of Catechism) in 1547 contained 11 religious hymns in Lithuanian with sheet music. Lithuanian jesuit Žygimantas Liauksminas (Sigismundus Lauxminus) published the first music handbook in Lithuania - Ars et praxis musica in 1667. It was a first book of the trilogy, devoted to Gregorian chant - other books include Graduale pro exercitatione studentium and Antifonale ad psalmos, iuxta ritum S. Romanae Ecclesiae, decantandos, necessarium. The books were published at the University of Vilnius - S.R.M. Academicis Societatis Jesu.[6]

Recent findings - The Sapieha Album (Sapiegos albumas) and the Kražiai Organbook (Kražių vargoninko sąsiuvinis) demonstrated that the big part of the Lithuanian church music of the 17th century was directly influenced by the most prominent composers of Italy of that time - Girolamo Frescobaldi; Italian organ tablature notation prevailed, basso continuo was studied.[6]

Lithuania and its turbulent history was a subject of operas long before the appearance of the national opera in Lithuania. Everardo II, re di Lituania (Everardo II, King of Lithuania), music by João de Sousa Carvalho, libretto by Gaetano Martinelli was written in 1782 to celebrate the birth of Pedro III, King of Portugal. I Lituani (The Lithuanians) - is an opera consisting by Amilcare Ponchielli to an Italian libretto by Antonio Ghislanzoni, based on the historical poem Konrad Wallenrod written by Adam Mickiewicz. It premiered at La Scala in Milan on 7 March 1874.

One of the first professional Lithuanian musicians was Juozas Kalvaitis (1842-1900). He composed a four-voiced Mass in the Lithuanian language in Tilžė.[7] In 1877, an oratorio The Creation by Joseph Haydn was translated to Lithuanian and performed in Vilnius.
The first national opera Birutė by composer Mikas Petrauskas (1873-1937), libretto - Gabrielius Landsbergis-Žemkalnis (1852-1916) was staged in 1906.

Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1875-1911) is considered the greatest Lithuanian composer of his generation, and probably of all time.[8]

Lithuanian folk music belongs to Baltic music branch which is connected with Neolithic corded ware culture. In Lithuanian territory meets two musical cultures: stringed (kanklių) and wind instrument cultures. These instrumental cultures probably formed vocal traditions.
Lithuanian folk music is archaic, mostly used for ritual purposes, containing elements of paganism faith.

There are three ancient styles of singing in Lithuania connected with ethnographical regions: monophony, multi-voiced homophony, heterophony and polyphony. Monophony mostly occurs in southern (Dzūkija), southwest (Suvalkija) and eastern (Aukštaitija) parts of Lithuania. Multi-voiced homophony, widespread in entire Lithuania, is the most archaic in Samogitia. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world scale: Lithuanian song fests and sutartinės multipart songs are on the UNESCO's representative list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.[9]

Sutartinės (from the word sutarti—to be in concordance, in agreement, singular sutartinė) are highly unique examples of folk music. They are an ancient form of two and three voiced polyphony, based on the oldest principles of multivoiced vocal music: heterophony, parallelism, canon and free imitation. Most of the sutartinės' repertoire was recorded in the 19th and 20th centuries, but sources from the 16th century on show that they were significant along with monophonic songs. At present the sutartinės have almost become extinct as a genre among the population, but they are fostered by many Lithuanian folklore ensembles.

The topics and functions of sutartinės encompass all major Lithuanian folk song genres. Melodies of sutartinės are not complex, containing two to five pitches. The melodies are symmetrical, consisting of two equal-length parts; rhythms are typically syncopated, and the distinctly articulated refrains give them a driving quality.

Sutartinės can be classed into three groups according to performance practices and function:

Sutartinės are a localized phenomenon, found in the northeastern part of Lithuania. They were sung by women, but men performed instrumental versions on the kanklės (psaltery), on horns, and on the skudučiai (pan-pipes). The rich and thematically varied poetry of the sutartinės attests to their importance in the social fabric. Sutartinės were sung at festivals, gatherings, weddings, and while performing various chores. The poetic language while not being complex is very visual, expressive and sonorous. The rhythms are clear and accented. Dance sutartinės are humorous and spirited, despite the fact that the movements of the dance are quite reserved and slow. One of the most important characteristics of the sutartinės is the wide variety of vocables used in the refrains (sodauto, lylio, ratilio, tonarilio, dauno, kadujo, čiūto, etc.).

Different vocal and instrumental forms developed, such as lyrical, satirical, drinking and banqueting songs, musical dialogues, wedding laments, games, dances and marches.

Chronicles and historical documents of the 13th through 16th centuries contain the first sources about songs relating the heroics of those fallen in battle against the Teutonic Knights. Later songs mention the Swedes, there are frequent references to Riga and Battle of Kircholm; songs collected in the early 19th century mention battles with the Tatars. Songs from uprisings and revolutions, as well as sonf of Lithuanian anti-Soviet guerrilla resistance in 1945-1952 and songs of the deportees are also classified as wartime historical songs.

They were sung at prescribed times of the year while performing the appropriate rituals. There are songs of Shrovetide and Lent, Easter swinging songs, and Easter songs called lalavimai. The Advent songs reflect the mood of staidness and reflection. Christmas songs contain vocables such as kalėda, lėliu kalėda; oi kalėda kalėdzieka, while Advent songs contain vocables such as leliumoj, aleliuma, aleliuma rūta, aleliuma loda and others. There are several typical melodic characteristics associated with Christmas ritual songs, such as a narrow range, three-measure phrases, dance rhythms, a controlled slow tempo, and a tonal structure based on phrygian, mixolydian or aeolian tetrachords. Polyphonic St. John's Feast songs are commonly called kupolinės, which include refrains and vocables such as kupolėle kupolio, kupolio kupolėlio, or kupole rože.

Work songs vary greatly in function and age. There are some very old examples, which have retained their direct relation with the rhythm and process of the work to be done. Later work songs sing more of a person's feelings, experiences and aspirations. The older work songs more accurately relate the various stages of the work to be done. They are categorized according to their purpose on the farm, in the home, and so on.

The rateliai (round dances) have long been a very important part of Lithuanian folk culture, traditionally performed without instrumental accompaniment. Since the 19th century, however, fiddle, basetle, lamzdeliai and kanklės came to accompany the dances, while modern groups also incorporate bandoneon, accordion, concertina, mandolin, clarinet, cornet, guitar and harmonica. During the Soviet occupation, dance ensembles used box kanklės and a modified clarinet called the birbynės; although the ensembles were ostensibly folk-based, they were modernized and sanitized and used harmonized and denatured forms of traditional styles.[10]

The most important Lithuanian popular folk music ensembles included Skriaudžių kanklės, formed in 1906, and Lietuva. Such ensembles were based on traditional music, but were modernized to be palatable to the masses; the early 20th century also saw the spread of traditional musical plays like The Kupiškėnai Wedding.[10]

Some of the most prominent modern village ensembles: Marcinkonys (Varėna dst.), Žiūrai (Varėna dst.), Kalviai-Lieponys (Trakai dst.), Luokė (Telšiai dst.), Linkava (Linkuva, Pakruojis dst.), Šeduviai (Šeduva, Radviliškis dst.), Užušiliai (Biržai dst.), Lazdiniai-Adutiškis (Švenčionys dst.). Some of the most prominent town folklore groups: Ratilio, Ūla, Jievaras, Poringė (Vilnius), Kupolė (Kaunas), Verpeta (Kaišiadorys), Mėguva (Palanga), Insula (Telšiai), Gastauta (Rokiškis), Kupkiemis (Kupiškis), Levindra (Utena), Sūduviai (Vilkaviškis). Children folk groups: Čiučiuruks (Telšiai), Kukutis (Molėtai), Čirulis (Rokiškis), Antazavė (Zarasai dst.)[1].

Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (September 22 [O.S. September 10] 1875 in Varėna—April 10 [O.S. March 28] 1911 in Pustelnik near Warsaw) was a Lithuanian painter and composer. During his short life he created about 200 pieces of music. His works have had profound influence on modern Lithuanian culture.

Čiurlionis studied piano and composition at the Warsaw Conservatory (1894–1899). Later he attended composition lectures at the Leipzig Conservatory (1901–1902). His symphonic poems In the Forest (Miške) and The Sea (Jūra) were performed only posthumously.

The Čiurlionis String Quartet performs in Lithuania and abroad. Every several years junior performers from Lithuania and neighbouring countries take part in The Čiurlionis Competition.

Modern classical composers emerged in seventies - Bronius Kutavičius, Feliksas Bajoras, Osvaldas Balakauskas, Onutė Narbutaitė, Vidmantas Bartulis and others. Most of those composers explored archaic Lithuanian music and its harmonic combination with modern minimalism and neoromanticism.[11]

Osvaldas Balakauskas (born 1937, Miliūnai) Graduated from the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute in 1961, attended Boris Lyatoshinsky's composition class at Kiev Conservatory in 1969.

In 1996 Music Information Centre Lithuania (MICL) was founded. It collects, promotes and shares information on Lithuanian musical culture.

Although the first opera in Lithuania was staged just 30 years later after it appeared in Italy, the musical and cultural development was constantly interrupted with historical turmoils. The Russian invasion in 1655 was especially grueling - many manors were destroyed, Vilnius was looted and demolished. The war with Sweden was started as well. The period was called Tvanas (The Deluge). Eventually it led to a partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1785 in Vilnius was the first city theatre created, which hosted operas as well. Musical life continued in the saloons of the aristocrats and nobleman. The house of 
singer Kristina Gerhardi-Frank and physician Joseph Frank was especially well known in Vilnius.

Development of national Lithuanian opera is related with national revival in the 20th century. Themes of the operas were taken from the national history or mythology. Lithuanian language was considered as language of singing. 
First Lithuanian national opera Birutė by composer Mikas Petrauskas was staged in 1906 in Vilnius City Concert Hall. After regaining the Independence of Lithuania in 1918 opera Gražina (1933) by composer Jurgis Karnavičius (1884 - 1941) was the first staged in a new Kaunas State Musical Theatre. It was followed in 1937 by the next opera of J.Karnavičius Radvila Perkūnas.

In Boston in 1924 Lithuanian emigrants music lovers staged opera by M.Petrauskas Eglė žalčių karalienė (Eglė the Queen of Serpents). Vytautas Klova (1926 - 2006) created mostly national operas - (Pilėnai 1955, Vaiva 1957, Duktė (The Daughter) 1960, Du kalavijai (Two Swords) 1965, Amerikietiškoji tragedija (An American Tragedy), 1968, Ave vita, 1974). Operas based on historical thematic were created by Julius Juzeliūnas (1916 - 2001) (Sukilėliai (The Rebels) 1957, banned by soviet censorship, staged only in 1977), B. Dvarionas (Dalia, 1958).

Bronius Kutavičius wrote operas Kaulo senis ant geležinio kalno (The Old Man of Bone on the Iron Hill, 1976), Strazdas – žalias paukštis (Thrush, the Green Bird, 1981), Lokys (The Bear, 2000),  Ignes et fides (Fire and Faith, 2003),[15] combining opera, ballet and oratorio.

Most notable Lithuanian opera singers: Kipras Petrauskas (1885 - 1968), Virgilijus Noreika (1935 - 2018), Vaclovas Daunoras (b. 1937), Irena Milkevičiūtė (b. 1947), Violeta Urmana (b. 1961). Other singers performing on international scenes are: Aušrinė Stundytė, Asmik Grigorian, Vaidas Vyšniauskas (Kristian Benedikt), Edgaras Montvidas, Justina Gringytė, Indre Viskontas. Liudas Truikys (1904 - 1987) was a renowned scenic designer. Prominent theatre director Eimuntas Nekrošius has staged several operas in Lithuania (Otello) and Italy (Macbeth). Fashion designer Juozas Statkevičius (b. 1968) created costumes for numerous operas.

The diversity of the modern national opera is represented by: Lokys (The Bear, 2000),[16] Geros dienos (Have a Godd Day!, 2011),[17] Cornet (2014),[18] Post Futurum (2018),[19] Prūsai (The Prussians, 2018).[20] Modern opera Sun & Sea (Marina) (2019)[21] was presented at Venice Biennale, Lithuanian pavilion and was awarded The Golden Lion for best national participation.[22]

Currently operas are staged in Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre, Vilnius City Opera, Kaunas State Musical Theatre, Klaipėda State Musical Theatre and by company Operomanija and by Lithuanian Opera Company of Chicago. Opera is a highly popular genre in Lithuania, collecting full halls. The annual NOA (New Opera Action)[23] - contemporary alternative opera and multidisciplinary art festival is being organized in Vilnius.

In 1971, despite being behind the Iron Curtain in Soviet occupied Lithuania Kęstutis Antanėlis has staged the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar - just one year after its album release.
In 1973 director Arūnas Žebriūnas [lt], composer Vyacheslav Ganelin, and poet Sigitas Geda created Velnio nuotaka (Devil's bride), the first Lithuanian musical film.
In 1974 the first Lithianian theatre  musical Ugnies medžioklė su varovais (Fire Hunt with Beaters) (composer - Giedrius Kuprevičius, libretto - Saulius Šaltenis, Liudas Jacinevičius) was staged.

In Lithuania choral music is very important. Only in Vilnius city there are three choirs laureates at the European Grand Prix for Choral Singing.
Vytautas Miškinis (born 1954) is a composer and choir director who is very popular in Lithuania and abroad. He has written over 400 secular and about 150 religious works.

The Communist government of the Lithuanian SSR criticized rock music, which was considered a decadent and corrupting cultural invasion from the West. The first local rock bands started to emerge around 1965 and included Kertukai, Aitvarai and Nuogi ant slenksčio (Naked On A Threshold)[24] in Kaunas, and Kęstutis Antanėlis, Vienuoliai (The Monks), and Gėlių Vaikai (Flower Childs) in Vilnius, among others.

Radio Luxembourg was the most important source of information about the music on other side of the Iron Curtain. It was very common for Lithuanian hippies or band players to listen to this radio. Radio Luxemburg bears strong associations in Lithuania with the Romas Kalanta generation (Kalantos karta). Another means was to smuggle LPs of popular Western bands into Lithuania and copy them onto magnetic tape. The records then spread further by making recordings to the friends, classmates.

Unable to express their opinions directly, the Lithuanian artists began organizing patriotic Roko Maršai and were using metaphors in their songs' lyrics, which were easily identified for their true meanings by the locals.[25][26] Postmodernist rock band Antis and its vocalist Algirdas Kaušpėdas were one of the most active performers who mocked the Soviet regime by using metaphors. For example, in the song Zombiai (Zombies), the band indirectly sang about the Red Army soldiers who occupied the state and its military base in Ukmergė.[27][28] Vytautas Kernagis' song Kolorado vabalai (Colorado beetles) was also a favorite due to its lyrics in which true meaning of the Colorado beetles was intended to be the Soviets decorated with the Ribbons of Saint George.

In the early independence years, rock band Foje was particularly popular and gathered tens of thousands of spectators to the concerts.[29] After disbanding in 1997, Foje vocalist Andrius Mamontovas remained one of the most prominent Lithuanian performers and an active participant in various charity events.[30] Marijonas Mikutavičius is famous for creating unofficial Lithuania sport anthem Trys milijonai (Three million) and official anthem of the EuroBasket 2011 Nebetyli sirgaliai (English version was named Celebrate Basketball).

In the 1980s, rock bands Foje, Antis, and Bix made a big impact in Lithuania. Short-lived alternative rock group Šiaurės kryptis (The Northern Direction, 1986 - 1995) issued only one album Netiekto, but still considered one of the best groups of that time.

In 1987, 1988 and 1989 Lithuania saw several big rock festivals, such as Roko Maršas (Rock March). Roko Maršas was connected to the ideology of Sąjūdis and independence movement of Lithuania.

1986–1987 marked the appearance of the punk scene in Lithuania. Bands like Už Tėvynę (For the Fatherland), Genocidas Raudonajam Interventui (A Genocide for The Red Intervents), SKAT, and Erkė maiše were leaning towards the classic punk rock of the 1970s, while others like 33% kiaulių pakeliui į Vatikaną and Turboreanimacija were more inclined towards hardcore punk (HC) stylistics. Turboreanimacija can be regarded as the most influential hardcore punk band of Lithuania, which in its time was well received by fanzines such as Maximumrocknroll in the United States. Their first up-tempo albums reminded listeners of early records from Scottish hardcore punk legends The Exploited, while later Turboreanimacija embarked on the power-punk road. Turboreanimacija disbanded in 1997 after granting a cult status among the Lithuanian underground. Post-punk group Kardiofonas (1986-1989) was highly popular with its hit Kalėdinė eglutė (Christmas tree).

More recent acts of this genre are ska-punk band Dr.Green (who are famous for their numerous DIY activities and intensive touring through the punk scenes of Europe), street-punkers Toro Bravo and hardcorists Bora and Mountainside.

Origins of Lithuanian pop music are in music of the cafes and restaurants of temporary capital of Lithuania - Kaunas in the 1930s. It was called estradinė muzika (estrade-music), lengvoji muzika (light music) and the phenomena sometimes named as mažoji scena (the little stage). Pop music bands Kopų balsai (Sounds of the dunes)[31] (in the beginning influenced by Juozas Tiškus orchestra), created in 1957 and band Nerija, which started activity in 1970 became very popular in Lithuania.

From the 2000s on, one of the most popular band in Lithuania is SKAMP. Although some pop groups sing in English, pop music in Lithuanian language is very popular.

The group Saulės laikrodis created in 1976, and Argo - in 1979 are considered the pioneers of electronic music in Lithuania. Sound director of Argo, Orūnas Urbonas constructed sound synthesizers (quasi-moog) for the group needs.[32]

Jazz was quite often mentioned in the press of Lithuania before the WWII. Back in Lithuania's first period of independence (1918-1940), the country was part of swinging Europe. Nearly every Lithuanian town had its own jazz band, and traditional jazz repertoire was performed by prestigious orchestras under the leadership of Mykolas Hofmekleris 
(violinist),[33][34][35] Abraomas Stupelis (violinist), Danielius Pomerancas (violinist).[36] Jazz was played in the modern cafés and restaurants of interbellum Kaunas - Konradas, Monika, Aldona, Versalis, Metropolis. In 1935 in the cinema Metropolitain, first concert of jazz orchestra took place. The jazz orchestra was assembled from leading musicians of Kaunas, most likely the basis was a band which played in the Konradas café in the Laisvės Alley.[37]
In 1940 in Kaunas Radio (Kauno radiofonas) was the first official jazz orchestra launched and led by Abraomas Stupelis. He is considered the pioneer of the Lithuanian big band.[38][39] Mykolas Hofmekleris in 1932 was decorated with the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas for his activity in the field of music.[40]

Soviet occupation destroyed much of the vibrant cultural life, cafes were closed, jazz was considered as an ideologically and politically charged music of the West.
Jazz scene was active even during the years of Soviet occupation. First sign of revival was an orchestra of Kaunas Polytechnic Institute led by Juozas Tiškus. Juozas Tiškus formed a professional swing orchestra of 28 members. Juozas Tiškus is also considered one of the instigators of popular Lithuanian music.
The real breakthrough would occur in 1970–71 with the coming together of the Ganelin/Tarasov/Chekasin trio, the alleged instigators of the Vilnius Jazz School.[41] The trio, known also as Ganelin Trio or GTCh combined free jazz with elements of Lithuanian folk and classic music. Café Neringa in Vilnius and café Tulpė (former Konradas) in Kaunas became places for jazz lovers and players.[citation needed]

Almost anything can be found on the jazz scene in Lithuania today, from Dixieland and a cappella groups, to all kinds of jazz fusion, nu-jazz and jazzcore.[42]

There are quite a few international jazz festivals in Lithuania:

1924 saw the first Dainų šventė (The Lithuanian Song Festival), song festivals which were state-supported and helped to keep folk traditions alive; these were held every five years (every four since 1990). Similar festivals take place in Estonia and Latvia since the 1870s. The 1960s saw people rebelling against Soviet-controlled traditions, and led a roots revival that soon led to celebrations of Lithuanian identity in festivals and celebrations.[10]

Lithuania is home to many folk music festivals. The Dainų šventė song festival is perhaps the most famous; it was first held in 1924, and has continued every five years since. Other major folk festivals include the Skamba skamba kankliai and the Atataria trimitai, both held annually; of historical importance is the Ant marių krantelio, which was held in the 1980s and was the first major festival of its kind. The Baltica International Folklore Festival is held in one of the Baltic states every year.[10]

The GAIDA Festival, organised in Vilnius since 1991 is the largest and the most prominent festival of modern music in Lithuania and in all Baltic countries.[43]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Lithuania
List of Lithuanian monarchs,"The monarchy of Lithuania concerned the monarchical head of state of Lithuania, which was established as an absolute[1][e] and hereditary monarchy. Throughout Lithuania's history there were three ducal dynasties—the House of Mindaugas, the House of Gediminas, and the House of Jagiellon. Despite this, the one and only crowned king of Lithuania was King Mindaugas I.[2][3] In two more instances, royal nobles were not crowned due to political circumstances, but held de jure recognition abroad —Vytautas the Great by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor,[4] and Mindaugas II by Pope Benedict XV.[5][4]

Others were seen as kings of Lithuania even though they had only considered it and never took further action to claim the throne, as in the case of Gediminas who was recognised as king of Lithuania by Pope John XXII.[6] The hereditary monarchy in Lithuania was first established in the 13th century during the reign of Mindaugas I and officially re-established as a constitutional monarchy on 11 July 1918, only to be abandoned soon afterwards on 2 November 1918.

During the inaugurations of Lithuanian monarchs until 1569, Gediminas' Cap was placed on the monarch's head by the Bishop of Vilnius in Vilnius Cathedral.[7]

Lithuania in the present day is a representative democracy in a semi-presidential system based on popular sovereignty, as defined in the current Constitution of Lithuania, and has no monarchy.

The full title held by king of Lithuania from 1253 to 1263 was:[8]

In Lithuanian: Iš Dievo malonės, Lietuvos karalius

In English: By the Grace of God, King of the Lithuania

The first mention of a Lithuanian king predates the establishment of the Christian kingdom itself: according to the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, Mindaugas' father was a great king who ""had no equal in his time.""[9] As the territory of Lithuania expanded eastwards, other king-titled grand dukes who ruled the country adopted similar titles for introducing themselves abroad. For instance, Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytenis was sometimes regarded as Rex Lethowinorum (King of Lithuanians) while his successor Gediminas took the Latin title of Rex Lithuanorum et Multorum Ruthenorum (King of Lithuanians and many Ruthenians).[10][11][12][13] Teutonic Knights referred to Algirdas and his wife Uliana (Julijona) as ""Grand King of Lithuania"" and ""Grand Queen of Lithuania"".[14] Even though it is traditionally accepted that Mindaugas was the only true king, all historical records, with the exception of Slavic annals, mention Lithuanian rulers as kings until 1386.[15]

Officially, the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania was introduced after the Pact of Horodło in 1413.[14] Until then, previous monarchs were called by different titles, including kings. This was because in Lithuania, unlike in the majority of other European monarchies, the Grand Duke was a sovereign monarch who was accountable to no one, thus de facto king.[14] The full title of Grand Duke of Lithuania was:[16]

In Lithuanian: Lietuvos didysis kunigaikštis

Following the Act of Krėva with Poland in 1385, the full Latin title was changed to Dei Gratia Rex Poloniae Magnus Dux Lithuaniae (By the Grace of God, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania).

The title of the Grand Duke of Lithuania mostly came into force during the reign of Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, who concluded the Ostrów Agreement with his cousin Jogaila in 1392 and the agreement was confirmed in the Pact of Vilnius and Radom in 1401. Since then Jogaila was titled the Supreme Duke of Lithuania (supremus dux Lithuaniae).[17][18][19][20] Vytautas the Great gained the factual rule of Lithuania, which was recognized by the treaties.[18] In 1398, the Lithuanian nobility declared Vytautas the Great as the King of Lithuania and, following the Congress of Lutsk in 1429, the crowning was sanctioned by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. However, Vytautas died before the crown arrived.[21][22][23]

Jogaila's son Władysław III also titled himself as the Supreme Duke of Lithuania.[19] John I Albert unilaterally declared himself as the Supreme Duke of Lithuania in 1492, but this title was rejected by the Lithuanian Council of Lords.[19]

In 1544–1548, Sigismund I the Old expressed his supreme monarchical authority in Lithuania by again using the Supreme Duke of Lithuania title when his son Sigismund II Augustus was his vicegerent in Lithuania.[19][24]

The inaugurations of the Lithuanian monarchs were held in Vilnius Cathedral and consisted of the placement of Gediminas' Cap on the Lithuanian monarch's head and the presentation of a sword.[7][17] The cap was placed on the head by the Bishop of Vilnius and the sword was presented by the Grand Marshal of Lithuania.[21][25] The regalia of Vytautas the Great consisted of Gediminas' Cap, sword, ring, flag, and seal.[21]

The first inauguration ceremony of a Lithuanian Grand Duke about which there is reliable information is that of Casimir IV Jagiellon, as reported by Jan Długosz.[26] Casimir IV was sent by his older brother King of Poland and Hungary, Supreme Duke of Lithuania Władysław III, to Lithuania to rule in his name.[27] But instead he was elected as Grand Duke upon his arrival to Vilnius on 29 June 1440, with the ringing of church bells and the singing of the Te Deum laudamus.[28][26] This was breaching the agreements of the Union of Grodno (1432) and terminating the Polish–Lithuanian union.[29][30] It manifested Lithuania as a sovereign state and its ruler Casimir IV Jagiellon stressed himself as a ""free lord"" (pan – dominus).[30] According to historian Edvardas Gudavičius, Bishop of Vilnius put a Gediminas' Cap in the Vilnius Cathedral on his head, despite the Polish nobility's opposition.[31][30]

Another documented inauguration is the enthronement of Alexander Jagiellon in 1492. Alexander was appointed Grand Duke by his father, nevertheless, a formal election of the ruler was held as part of a general assembly, which was attended for the first time by representatives from all the lands of the Grand Duchy.[32] The course of the ceremony was documented by Maciej Stryjkowski, who reported that after the election lords elevated Alexander in the cathedral. The newly elected ruler was dressed ""in a ducal cap with pearls and precious stones set in it, also the usual robe that today the princes of the Reich wear at the imperial coronation.""[33] Then Bishop of Vilnius Wojciech Tabor blessed him and held a pastoral exhortation over him. Then the Grand Marshal of Lithuania Petras Jonaitis Mantigirdaitis handed Alexander a bare sword and a sceptre.[34][35] Subsequently, the Poles considered electing Alexander Jagiellon as the King of Poland, however instead of him John I Albert was elected as the King of Poland in August 1492 and this led to another termination of the Polish–Lithuanian union.[36]

Stryjkowski also relayed the election and inauguration of Sigismund I as Grand Duke of Lithuania on 20 October 1509. The ceremony was again attended by Bishop Wojciech Tabor, who this time not only blessed but also placed a cap on the ruler's head. In turn, Grand Marshal Michael Glinski presented him with a sword. Sigismund received the oath of the Lithuanian lords while sitting on the throne.[37] According to Stryjkowski, the cap was: ""of red velvet with gold spheres set with precious stones"".[38]

The last ceremony to elevate a grand duke took place on 18 October 1529, when Sigismund Augustus was elevated to this dignity during his father's lifetime. The ceremony occurred in the great hall of the newly built lower castle, as the cathedral burned down that same year.[39][40] The young Sigismund Augustus sat on the throne between his parents, surrounded by members of the council of lords. The cap was placed on the ruler's head by the Bishop of Vilnius, while the Grand Marshal presented him with a sword.[41] Following the Union of Lublin, which formed the federative Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, and the death of the last Gediminid ruler Sigismund II Augustus in 1572, separate inaugurations in Vilnius Cathedral were abolished, therefore Gediminas' Cap lost its ceremonial significance.[7][21][42] The insignias of the Lithuanian rulers were not preserved and following the Union of Lublin only the seal (kept by the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania) and the flag (carried near the ruler by the Grand Flag Bearer of Lithuania) remained.[21]

The demand of a separate inauguration ceremony of the Grand Duke of Lithuania was raised by the nobles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. Mikołaj ""the Red"" Radziwiłł, Eustachy Wołłowicz, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Konstanty Ostrogski) during the negotiations of the Union of Lublin, however it was not officially included into it.[43] On 20 April 1576 a congress of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's nobles was held in Grodno which adopted an Universal, signed by the participating Lithuanian nobles, which announced that if the delegates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania will feel pressure from the Poles in the Election sejm, the Lithuanians will not be obliged by an oath of the Union of Lublin and will have the right to select a separate monarch.[44] On 29 May 1580, bishop Merkelis Giedraitis in the Vilnius Cathedral presented Grand Duke Stephen Báthory (King of Poland since 1 May 1576) a luxuriously decorated sword and a hat adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself), while this ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, this way ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin.[45][46][47][48] Nevertheless, per Union of Lublin the rulers of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were elected in joint Polish–Lithuanian election sejms until the Third Partition in 1795 and received separate titles of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.[49][25] During the coronations of joint Polish–Lithuanian monarchs, the Polish crown was also announced as a property of both the Polish and Lithuanian nobles.[21]

In 1564, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund II Augustus renounced his rights to the hereditary Lithuanian throne—the separate inauguration ceremony and insignia for Grand Duke of Lithuania were abolished. On 1 July 1569, Sigismund II Augustus united both of the countries into a single bi-federation, known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which had existed for the next 226 years. The Union included constitutional changes such as creating a formal elective monarchy, which would simultaneously reign over both parties.[50] Following the death of Sigismund II in 1572, a joint Polish–Lithuanian monarch was to be elected as in the Union of Lublin it was agreed that the title ""Grand Duke of Lithuania"" will be received by a jointly elected monarch in the Election sejm on his accession to the throne, thus losing its former institutional significance, however the Union of Lublin guaranteed that the institution and the title ""Grand Duke of Lithuania"" will be preserved.[7][51] The demand of a separate inauguration ceremony of the Grand Duke of Lithuania was raised by the nobles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. Mikołaj ""the Red"" Radziwiłł, Eustachy Wołłowicz, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Konstanty Ostrogski) during the negotiations of the Union of Lublin, however it was not officially included into it.[52] Nevertheless, before the 1576 Polish–Lithuanian royal election a congress of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's nobles was held on 20 April 1576 in Grodno which adopted an Universal, signed by the participating Lithuanian nobles, which announced that if the delegates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania will feel pressure from the Poles in the Election sejm, the Lithuanians will not be obliged by an oath of the Union of Lublin and will have the right to select a separate monarch.[44] On 29 May 1580, a ceremony was held in the Vilnius Cathedral during which bishop Merkelis Giedraitis presented Stephen Báthory (King of Poland since 1 May 1576) a luxuriously decorated sword and a hat adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself), while this ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, this way ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin.[53][46][54][55] During the Deluge of the Second Northern War, the Commonwealth temporarily disintegrated in 1655 when the magnates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania signed the Union of Kėdainiai with the Swedish Empire[56] and became its protectorate with Charles X Gustav serving as Grand Duke of Lithuania.[57] It was short-lived because Sweden lost the war.[56] The Commonwealth permanently ceased to exist in 1795, following its third partition by the neighbouring powers, Prussia, Russia and Austria. Following the partitions, the lands of ethnic Lithuania were divided—Lithuania proper became a part of the Russian Empire while Sudovia became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

As the conquests of Prussia by the Teutonic Order and of Livonia by the Livonian Brothers were coming to an end, both Catholic religious orders began posing an existential threat to then-pagan Lithuania. In response, Duke Mindaugas, who by then had managed to strengthen his grip in various Baltic and Slavic lands, sought to consolidate power and unite Lithuania into one political entity, convert to Christianity, and become king.[58] In 1250 or 1251, he was baptised as a Roman Catholic. In 1253, probably in Vilnius or Novogrudok,[4] he and his wife Morta were crowned King and Queen, thus establishing a short-lived alliance with the Livonian Order. This laid the basis for the international recognition of the newly created Kingdom of Lithuania as a Western country.

Some historical documents suggest that at the time of signing the Treaty of Salynas in 1398, Lithuanian nobles had acknowledged Vytautas as their King as a symbolic declaration of allegiance.[59] Vytautas himself sought to officially establish his reign by coronation at least three times.[4] All three attempts were unsuccessful because the political situation was much more complicated—by this point the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland were under a joint rule of Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło) with the Crown being in Kraków, Poland. As a consequence, the idea of a fully-fledged Lithuanian monarchy as well as Poland losing its influence over its neighbour was met with fierce resistance from the Polish nobles.[4] The first time coronation was planned on 8 September 1430, but after one of the delegations that transported the crown learned that the first delegation was robbed on its way to Lithuania, they returned to Nuremberg. In the same year of October, Vytautas up until his death had planned his coronation at least two more times but with no success.[4]

In 1526, the Lithuanian Council of Lords suggested King Sigismund I the Old to grant the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the status of a kingdom, but such a proposal was rejected by the ruling Jagiellonian dynasty.[60]

During the First World War, the German Empire wanted Lithuania proper to be annexed and become a part of either Prussia or Saxony,[61] which for 123 years remained to be a part of the Russian Empire following the Third Partition of the Polish−Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. In an attempt to avoid becoming a province but remain on good terms with Germany, the Council of Lithuania decided to establish a separate constitutional monarchy with Wilhelm von Urach as King with his residence being in Verkiai Palace. According to the twelve-point document resembling the rudiments of a Constitution, the Kingdom of Lithuania was supposed to have had a bicameral legislature with a representative role of the monarch. Wilhelm von Urach was also presented with conditions such as adopting the title of Mindaugas II, letting his children to a Lithuanian school, only appointing courtiers, ministers and other high-ranking public officials who are Lithuanian citizens and speak the country's official language as well as not leaving the state for more than two months per year without the permission of the government. As the war ended, it became clear that Germany was losing. On 5 October 1918, in the Reichstag, the new Chancellor of Germany Maximilian of Baden announced that his state acknowledged the right of nations to self-determination and supported their efforts of becoming independent countries.[62] Soon afterwards, Germany expressed its official support for the independence of Lithuania.[62] Furthermore, the diplomats of France had also unambiguously proclaimed to the Council of Lithuania and the Parliament that having a monarch of German descent would be seen as unacceptable.[63] On 2 November 1918, as it became apparent that King-elect Mindaugas himself was hesitant to arrive in Lithuania for his coronation due to political unrest, the Council decided to abandon the idea of being a satellite monarchy and establish a fully independent republic instead.

Although there are no monarchist parties in modern Lithuania, there is a monarchist movement, which is in favor of re-establishing the short-lived monarchy of 1918.[31] The movement alongside the Lithuanian Royal Union of Nobility believe that the current Lithuanian state did not undergo all of the complicated and necessary procedures to truly abolish the Lithuanian monarchy.[64] According to the senate marshal of the organization ""Palace of the Kingdom of Lithuania"", Stanislovas Švedarauskas:

Can we present the specific date when the Kingdom of Lithuania of the Middle Ages ceased to exist and when did the Lithuanian 20th-century constitutional monarchy end? In the words of historians, when Mindaugas I died in 1263, the Kingdom had disappeared as well. However, after almost 100 years, in the 14th century, Gediminas would send his letters proclaiming to be ""King of Lithuanians and many Ruthenians."" In November 1918, the State Council left the question of Mindaugas II to the Constituent Assembly. And while it is true that the latter declared Lithuania to be a democratic republic on 15 May 1920, I have never heard of the Constituent Assembly officially denouncing the State Council's declaration of 11 July 1918, which called to create a constitutional monarchy in Lithuania and invite Mindaugas II to take his throne.[64]

Political commentator Česlovas Iškauskas responded:

In 1918, Germany exerted great influence. But now the idea of re-establishing the constitutional monarchy as well as the activities of the ""Palace of the Kingdom of Lithuania"" to me seems like a game when you have nothing better to do. At the moment Lithuania has much more important issues—it needs to think how to withstand current threats, not about a new monarchy.[65]

Prince Inigo von Urach, the grandson of Wilhelm von Urach (Mindaugas II), claims that according to Almanach de Gotha he remains to be the rightful claimant to the Lithuanian throne[66] and is willing to become King of Lithuania, if the nation wants him to. To quote him from an interview for LRT, ""It's not my thing to decide it [the idea of officially being crowned King], that's the thing of the population here, of the citizens of Lithuania. It's not my thing [to decide]. But I promise—if they want me, I would be ready for this job.""[31][67] He also mentioned that Wilhelm von Urach expressed his will in his Testament of ""keeping the claim of the throne"" of Lithuania as well as Monaco.[67]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lithuanian_monarchs

The purpose of the Lithuanian Armed Forces are to be the principal deterrent against any security threat to the nation. Lithuania's defence system is based on the concept of ""total and unconditional defence"" mandated by Lithuania's National Security Strategy. The goal of Lithuania's defence policy is to prepare their society for general defence and to integrate Lithuania into Western security and defence structures. The Ministry of National Defence is responsible for combat forces, search and rescue, and intelligence operations.[4]

Male conscription is in place since 2015, when it was reinstated after being ended in 2008, due to concerns about the geopolitical environment in light of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[5]

In early 2022, Lithuania's defence budget for 2022 was approximately €1.05 billion,[1][c] but it was increased to €1.5 billion on 17 March 2022.[6] In 2024, the budget was raised to €2.3 billion and is projected to reach 3.03% of GDP.[3]

The Lithuanian military originates in the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, active from the 13th century to 1795.[7] After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Lithuanian Army remained equal to the Polish Crown army in the military of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until the Third Partition in 1795. The Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army fought in many major battles, such as the Battle of Blue Waters (1362/63), Battle of Grunwald (1410), Battle of Orsha (1514) and Battle of Kircholm (1605).

Similarly to other medieval European states, the army was raised by the nobility during the Late Middle Ages. By the 17th century, it was mostly outclassed by professional forces and a standing army was instituted.

From the 12th century's end and into the 13th century, Lithuania frequently went to war against the western and southwestern Rus' states, Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia and Duchy of Masovia, and also devastated the lands along the Daugava and elsewhere.[7] From the early 1200s, Lithuanians fought against the Swordbrothers, then from 1237 against the Livonian Order, and from the second half of the 13th century's against the State of the Teutonic Order.[7] Fighting on Lithuania's northern and western frontiers was unceasing, the Lithuanian state expanded southwards and eastwards in the Late Middle Ages.[7] The Lithuanian army was mobile, as it had to fight on many fronts: the State of the Teutonic Order to the west, the Livonian Order to the north, the Golden Horde and its vassal Muscovy to the east, and the Tatar khanates to the south.[7] According to 13th-century sources, Lithuanian soldiers rode horses on military expeditions but fought on foot, arranged in three rows during battles.[7] The best-armed and most experienced fought in the front, while the least experienced and lightly armed were in the last row.[7] Furthermore, the Lithuanians were skilled at fighting using spears, especially on horseback. The earliest written mention of such tactics, from 1208, says that Lithuanians on horses threw spears at their enemies.[8]

Although the Germans initially had superior weaponry in the 13th century, the Lithuanians won the Battles of Saule (1236), Durbe (1260), Karuse (1270) and the Aizkraukle (1279).[7] However they were less successful against enemy fortifications, especially brick castles.[7] Eventually the front lines stabilised over time, and the one against the Livonian Order more or less followed the modern Latvia–Lithuania border, while the one against the Teutonic Order was close to the Nemunas.[7][9] A castle system fortified the Lithuanian side of the border along the river.[7]

Over the 14th century, the Teutonic and Livonian orders organised raids into Lithuania.[7] Lithuanians reciprocated by raiding their respective territories, but the Lithuanian raids were fewer in number.[7] The Lithuanians won the Battle of Medininkai (1320), but lost the Battle of Strėva (1348).[7] More and more, the Teutonic Order destroyed the Lithuanian castle system along the Nemunas and built their own castles near the Lithuanian ones.[7] As the German and Livonian orders were constantly reinforced by Christian European countries, it became increasingly difficult to defend Lithuania solely by military means.[7] A new generation of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes, Jogaila and Vytautas the Great, used not only military, but also diplomatic and political means, for example Lithuanian baptism in 1387, to protect Lithuania.[7]

Meanwhile, on the other side of Lithuania, the Golden Horde's army was destroyed in the Battle of Blue Waters (1362–1363).[7] In 1368, 1370, and 1372, the Lithuanian Grand Duke Algirdas led the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army on military expeditions against Muscovy.[7] However, the Battle of the Vorksla River (1399) was a decisive victory for the Golden Horde.[7]

Finally, the German Teutonic Order was crushed in the Battle of Grunwald (1410) (known as Battle of Žalgiris in Lithuanian historiography), which was the largest Middle Age battle in Central and Eastern Europe.[7] In this key battle, the Lithuanian Army was led by Vytautas the Great.[7] Under him, the Lithuanian Army attacked the lands of the Republics of Pskov, in 1426, and Novgorod, in 1428.[7] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had internal civil wars in the first half of the 15th century.[7] The Lithuania Army engaged in biological warfare already in 1422, when it catapulted manure made from infected victims into an opposing Bohemian town as part of the Hussite Wars.[10] In 1435, Sigismund Kęstutaitis' army defeated the opposing army, which included troops of the Livonian Order, led by Švitrigaila in the Battle of Wiłkomierz.[7]

This century was marked by war of Lithuania against Muscovy and the Crimean Khanate, against whom they won the Battle of Kletsk in 1506.[7] The strengthening Grand Duchy of Moscow starting in the late 15th century waged unceasing wars over Lithuania's eastern territories.[7] In 1514, during the fourth war, the Lithuanians triumphed over the numerically larger Muscovite army in the famous Battle of Orsha.[7] However, Lithuania lost a part of its eastern lands, most notably the strategically important fortress of Smolensk.[7] The Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army fought against Muscovy in the Livonian War and won against the Muscovite army, twice its size in the Battle of Ula in 1564.[7] Three years into the Livonian War, the Treaty of Vilnius.[9] made Livonia part of Lithuania in 1561 with the Union of Lublin concluded in 1569.[9] In the late 1570s and early 1580s, the Lithuanian and Polish armies cooperated in Stephen Báthory's incursions into Russia.[7]

The 17th century was marked by wars against Sweden, the Tsardom of Muscovy and the Ottoman Empire.[7] The Lithuanian army and the Polish army fought against the Ottoman forces notably at both Battles of Khotyn in 1621 and 1673.[7] During the war with Sweden from 1600 to 1629, the Lithuanian army defeated Swedish forces three times their number at the Battle of Kircholm in 1605.[7] However, this war highlighted the Commonwealth's difficulty recruiting and retaining enough troops, better arming its soldiers with firearms and bettering their use.[7] Sweden seized a significant part of Livonia as part of Swedish Livonia.[7] In the first half of the 17th century, Smolensk returned to Lithuania following the Smolensk War.[7]

The Commonwealth's military weakness in the middle and late 17th century was evidenced in the Deluge.[7] In 1655, the much-smaller Lithuanian army could not defend the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius against Muscovite attack.[7] This was the first time that Vilnius was occupied by a foreign state.[9] The Swedish and Muscovite armies occupied large parts of Lithuania.[7] Nevertheless, Lithuania succeeded in holding out and liberated Vilnius, Kaunas, Samogitia and the eastern Voivodeships, except for Smolensk Voivodeship and other parts.[7] Militarily speaking, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was weakening however.[7]

During the Great Northern War the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army no longer defended the country and the Lithuanian magnates' private armies supported different sides.[7] Throughout the 18th century, many confederations in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth sought different political goals.[7] The Bar Confederation (1768–1772), which happened partly in Lithuania, attempted but failed to stem the increasing influence of Imperial Russia and the First partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth followed.[7] In the face of the possible loss of independence, military reforms in the Four Years' Sejm (1788–1792) significantly expanded the Lithuanian army, which reached a strength of 17,500.[7][9] Attempts to make the Commonwealth's armies equal those of neighbouring absolute monarchies were unsuccessful and the unsuccessful War of 1792 resulted in the Second Partition.[7]

The Polish and Lithuanian armies put up a spirited fight against the Imperial Russian Army and the Prussian Army in the Kościuszko Uprising.[7] In addition to regular forces, many ad hoc units such as the Vilnian National Guard also fought, as well as many irregular units.[7] In the end, the Uprising was defeated and much of the remainder of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army was lost in the Battle of Praga on 4 November 1794.[7] With the uprising defeated, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland ended with the Third Partition, and their respective armies being disbanded.[7]

After Lithuania's restoration on 16 February 1918, the country immediately began creating an army.[19] The Ministry of Defence's first order, issued on 23 November 1918, is considered to mark the establishment of the modern Lithuanian Armed Forces.[20] The newly-formed army almost immediately fought three wars of independence. Having won the Lithuanian–Soviet War and the war against the Bermontians, Lithuania lost large chunks of territory, including its capital Vilnius in the Polish–Lithuanian War. Armoured equipment in the interwar period,primarily consisted of light tanks and armored cars: French Renault FT-17s, British Vickers Carden-Loyd M1934s and M1936s, Swedish Landsverk-181, and German Ehrhardt E-V/4.[19] In 1935, the country opened an advanced military research laboratory, specialising in chemical materials for ammunition as well as defence against chemical warfare.[21] The construction of the laboratory was supervised by Juozas Vėbra. In 1940, Lithuania had a considerable Air Force, consisting of 118 aircraft with about half of them designed and produced locally. During the World War II, Lithuania was invaded by both Nazis and Soviets, which eventually concluded in Soviet occupation. The Lithuanian Armed Forces transformed into the Lithuanian People's Army in 1940 under the People's Government of Lithuania.[22] Despite Soviet deportations from Lithuania, armed Lithuanian resistance lasted until the 1950s.

Following the restoration of independence, the defence forces were formally reestablished on 25 April 1990 with the creation of the Department of National Defence. After the January Events, the Voluntary National Defence Service was formed of lightly armed volunteers. The Lithuanian Armed Forces were officially restored on 19 November 1992.[20] Western European countries, especially Sweden, helped to arm the initial force by selling or donating excess equipment. Lithuania began the modernisation of its military, becoming the first European country to acquire the US-made FGM-148 Javelin systems in 2001 and the FIM-92 Stinger systems in 2002.[23]

Lithuania applied for NATO membership in 1994 and eventually joined the alliance in 2004. It has modernised its armed forces and participated in various international missions including the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan. Conscription ended in September 2008, but was reintroduced in 2015 due to deteriorating geopolitical environment after the Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.[24][25] NATO also responded by establishing the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence in 2017 with a battlegroup in Lithuania which was led by Germany.[26]

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania rapidly increased the defence spending, becoming one of the top spenders by GDP in the NATO military alliance.[27] The following years marked major acquisitions, including M142 HIMARS with the ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles, additional NASAMS medium-range air defence systems and artillery ammunition.[28] In 2023, Lithuanian leadership approved the plans to form an army division, based on the three army brigades.[29] As part of the plan, the country also decided to acquire Leopard 2 tanks.[30] In 2023, Germany agreed to deploy a brigade in Lithuania on a permanent basis.[31] The Bundeswehr's 45th Panzer Brigade, consisting of ~5,000 troops, is scheduled to be deployed by 2027.[32] On 28 January 2025, the 1st Division was re-created.

The President of Lithuania is the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces according to the Constitution of Lithuania. Ministry of National Defence is directly responsible for the organisation of the defence system.[33] Chief of Defence (Lithuanian: Kariuomenės vadas) is subordinate to the Minister of National Defence. Defence Staff (Lithuanian: Gynybos štabas) of the Armed Forces is responsible for the preparation of defence and mobilisation plans.[34]

The Lithuanian Armed Forces consist of the Lithuanian Land Force, Lithuanian Air Force, Lithuanian Navy, Lithuanian Special Operations Force and other units:[35][36]

Separate units directly subordinated to the Armed Forces:

Directly subordinated to the Chief of Defence are the Special Operations Force and Military Police. The Reserve Forces are under command of the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces. Lithuanian Riflemen's Union is a paramilitary organization that cooperates with the Armed Forces, but it is not part of them. However, during the state of war, its armed formations fall under the command of the Armed Forces. The same applies to the State Border Guard Service and the Public Security Service.[37]

The core of the Lithuanian Land Forces structure is the Mechanised Infantry Brigade Iron Wolf (MIB ""Iron Wolf"") consisting of four mechanized infantry battalions and an artillery battalion, supported by the Žemaitija Motorized infantry Brigade, which has three battalions and one artillery battalion as well. The third, Aukštaitija Light Infantry Brigade, is a reserve formation with active training. Its command, signal and logistic units are manned by professional soldiers.

The Volunteer Forces form another brigade-size force, consisting of six territorial units. Other auxiliary units include Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion and Juozas Lukša Land Forces Training Center.

The Lithuanian Land forces use equipment compatible with NATO standards. Since 2007, the standard assault rifle is the German Heckler & Koch G36. Units are supplied with modern variants of anti-tank weapons (M72 LAW, Carl Gustaf, AT4, FGM-148 Javelin) as well as man-portable air-defense systems (PZR Grom, RBS-70, FIM-92 Stinger). Modern armoured equipment includes: Oshkosh L-ATV armoured cars, Boxer infantry fighting vehicles (local designation IVF ""Vilkas"") armed with Spike-LR anti-tank missiles and PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers. Lithuanian Land forces have carried out major modernization and acquired more new weapons and heavier armour.

Lithuania has been restructuring its armed forces so that one-tenth of the Land Forces could at any given time be deployed for international operations, while half of the Land Forces would be prepared to deploy outside Lithuania's borders. The volunteers have already successfully participated in international operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq.

In May 2023, the State Defence Council approved the plan to form an army division, based on the three army brigades.[29] The 1st Division would have enhanced capabilities, including new tank, reconnaissance, engineering and artillery battalions.[29]

The Lithuanian Air Force (LAF) is an integral part of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The LAF is formed by professional military servicemen and non-military personnel. Units are located at various bases across Lithuania:

The initial formation of the LAF was the 2nd transport squadron with the transfer of 20 An-2 aircraft from civilian to military use, with initial basing at the Barysiai Airport on 27 April 1992. These were joined by four L-39C Albatros aircraft to be used by the 1st fighter (training) squadron. These were in addition to Mil Mi-8 helicopters and a short-range transport aircraft L-410, all of which went through a capital overhaul, upgrade and modernisation in the 2000s.

Following the initial acquisitions, the LAF began its aircraft's modernisation by ordering three C-27J Spartan transporters in 2006. In 2013, three Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin helicopters were acquired from France and, in 2020, Lithuania announced an order or four Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the USA. Simultaneously, new medium-range and long-range radars were acquired for the Airspace Surveillance and Control Command.

Air space is patrolled by jet fighters from other NATO members and they are based in Zokniai Air Base, near the city of Šiauliai (see Baltic Air Policing). The external border of the European Union (with Kaliningrad and Belarus) is patrolled by the Aviation Unit of the Lithuanian State Border Guard Service which, since the 2000s, uses helicopters EC-120, EC-135 and EC-145.

The Navy consists of the Warship Flotilla, the Sea Coastal Surveillance System, the Naval Logistic Service, Training Center and Maritime Rescue Coordination Center. The flotilla is the core component of the Navy and consists of the Mine Countermeasures Squadron, the Patrol Ships Squadron, and the Harbour Boats Group.[39] The current Commander in Chief of the Lithuanian Navy is Flotilla Admiral Giedrius Premeneckas.

The Naval base and Headquarters are located in the city of Klaipėda.[40] The Navy uses patrol ships for coastal surveillance. The four newly acquired Flyvefisken-class patrol vessels replaced the older Storm-class patrol boats and Grisha-class corvettes.

From 1 August 2022, in order to eliminate the coastal and port defense gap and perform other functions assigned to the marines, the Naval Forces Port and Coastal Defense Service was established and partially formed by merging the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Divers Team and the Naval Forces Logistics Service Security Company into one structure, which includes two infantry (fusilier) companies. In the process of forming the unit's traditions, the soldiers serving in the unit began to be called marine fusiliers (marine infantry), and the service itself is unofficially called the Fusilier Battalion[41].

In April 2025, the Navy announced that the marine unit would be officially renamed the General Kazimieras Nestoras Sapiega Fusiliers Battalion and would continue the traditions of the 7th Fusiliers Regiment.[42]

The Lithuanian Special Operations Forces of Lithuanian Armed Forces have been in operation de facto since 2002 and it were established de jure on 3 April 2008, when amendments of National Defence System organisation and military service law came into force.[43]

The Special Operations Forces are responsible for special reconnaissance, direct actions, and military support. They have also in charge of other tasks, e.g., protection of VIPs in peacetime. They are formed by the Special Purpose Service, Vytautas the Great Jaeger Battalion and Combat Divers Service. The Special Operations Forces organization is flexible, which makes it easy to form squadrons intended for specific operations and missions. The Special Operations Forces can be called upon inside the territory of Lithuania when law enforcement agencies lack or do not have the necessary capabilities to react to terrorist attacks.[44]

The Special Operations Forces Squadron ""Aitvaras"" was deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. From 2005 to 2006 its squadrons were on standby as part of the NATO Response Force.[44]

Lithuania has been a member of NATO military alliance since 2004. In the European Union, Lithuanian Armed Forces have also taken part in the Nordic Battle Group since 2008. Lithuanian Armed Forces also participate in the Joint Expeditionary Force formed in 2014.

In 2009, to encourage regional cooperation, Lithuania joined the initiative to form the Lithuanian–Polish–Ukrainian Brigade.

Soon after the restoration of independence, Lithuania applied for NATO membership in January 1994. Together with another six Central and Eastern European countries, Lithuania was invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the 2002 Prague summit and became a member of the Alliance in March 2004. Lithuania entered NATO on full-fledged rights immediately after the procedures of joining the North Atlantic Treaty were completed and acquired rights to participate in the political decision-making process of the Alliance. Integration into the military structures of NATO became a long-term task of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Mechanised Infantry Brigade ""Iron Wolf"" was affiliated to the Danish Division based on agreements signed by Denmark and Lithuania in August 2006. Lithuanian Armed Forces started to boost the Brigade's ability to cooperate with the forces of other NATO members.

Baltic Air Policing was established by NATO allies since Lithuania and the other Baltic states do not have capabilities to secure their airspace. Fighter jets of NATO members are permanently deployed in Zokniai airport near the city Šiauliai to provide cover for the Baltic states airspace.[45] In 2013, NATO Energy Security Centre of Excellence was established in Vilnius.

Following the 2016 Warsaw summit, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence was deployed in the Baltic States with the multinational battalion battle group in Lithuania being led by Germany.

Lithuania also cooperates with the two other Baltic states – Latvia and Estonia in several trilateral Baltic defence co-operation initiatives:

In January 2011, the Baltic states were invited to join Nordic Defence Cooperation, the defence framework of the Nordic countries.[47] In November 2012, the three countries agreed to create a joint military staff in 2013.[48] Future co-operation will include sharing of national infrastructures for training purposes and specialisation of training areas (BALTTRAIN) and collective formation of battalion-sized contingents for use in the NATO rapid-response force.[49]

Lithuanian soldiers have taken part in international operations since 1993. From the summer of 2005 until 2014, Lithuania has been part of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF), leading a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in the town of Chaghcharan in the province of Ghor. The PRT included personnel from Denmark, Iceland and the US. There have also been special operation forces units in Afghanistan. They were placed in Kandahar province.

Since joining international operations in 1993, Lithuania has lost two soldiers. 1st Lt. Normundas Valteris fell in Bosnia (17 April 1996), Sgt. Arūnas Jarmalavičius in Afghanistan (22 May 2008).[50]

a. ^ The 23,000 is structured like this: 14,500 in the Army, 1,500 in the Air Force, 700 in the Navy, and 6,300 in other units. The other units includes the Logistics Support Command (1,400), Training and Doctrine Command (1,500), the Special Operations Force (unknown) as well as the battalions of HQ and Military Police (2,600).[51]

Demographics of Lithuania,"Demographic features of the population of Lithuania include population density, ethnicity, level of education, health, economic status, and religious affiliations.

The earliest evidence of inhabitants in present-day Lithuania dates back to 10,000 BC. Between 3000 and 2000 BC, the people of the Corded Ware culture spread over a vast region of eastern Europe, between the Baltic Sea and the Vistula River in the West and the Moscow–Kursk line in the East. Merging with the indigenous peoples, they gave rise to the Balts, a distinct Indo-European ethnic group whose descendants are the present-day Lithuanian and Latvian nations and the former Old Prussians.

The name of Lithuania – Lithuanians – was first mentioned in 1009. Among its etymologies there are a derivation from the word Lietava, for a small river, a possible derivation from a word leičiai, but most probable is the name for union of Lithuanian ethnic tribes ('susilieti, lietis' means to unite and the word 'lietuva' means something which has been united).

The primary Lithuanian state, the Duchy of Lithuania, emerged in the territory of Lietuva, the ethnic homeland of Lithuanians. At the birth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL), ethnic Lithuanians made up about 70% of the population.[1] With the acquisition of new Ruthenian territories, this proportion decreased to 50% and later to 30%. By the time of the largest expansion towards Kievan Rus' lands, at the end of the 13th and during the 14th century, the territory of the GDL was about 800,000 km2, of which 10% was ethnically Lithuanian.[2] The ethnic Lithuanian population is estimated to have been 420,000 out of 1.4 million in 1375 (the territory was about 700,000 km2), and 550,000 out of 3.8 million in 1490 (territory: 850,000 km2)[3][4][5] In addition to the Ruthenians and Lithuanians, other significant ethnic groups throughout GDL were Jews and Tatars. The combined population of Poland and GDL in 1493 is estimated as 7.5 million, of whom 3.25 million were Poles, 3.75 million Ruthenians and 0.5 million Lithuanians.[6]

With the Union of Lublin Lithuanian Grand Duchy lost large part of lands to the Polish Crown (see demographics of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). An ethnic Lithuanian proportion being about 1/4 in GDL after the Union of Lublin was held until the partitions. There was much devastation and population loss throughout the GDL in the mid and late 17th century,[7] including the ethnic Lithuanian population in Vilnius voivodeship. Besides devastation,[clarification needed] the Ruthenian population declined proportionally[clarification needed] after the territorial losses to the Russian Empire. In 1770 there were about 4.84 million inhabitants in GDL, of which the largest ethnic group were Ruthenians, about 1.39 million – Lithuanians.[clarification needed][1] The voivodeships with a majority ethnic Lithuanian population were Vilnius, Trakai and Samogitian voivodeships, and these three voivodeships comprised the political center of the state. In the southern angle of Trakai voivodeship and south-eastern part of Vilnius voivodeship there were also many Belarusians; in some of the south-eastern areas they were the major linguistic group.

The Ruthenian population formed a majority in GDL from the time of the GDL's expansion in the mid 14th century; and the adjective ""Lithuanian"", besides denoting ethnic Lithuanians, from early times denoted any inhabitant of GDL, including Slavs and Jews.

The Ruthenian language, corresponding to today's Belarusian and Ukrainian, was then called Russian, and was used as one of the chancellery[clarification needed] languages by Lithuanian monarchs. However, there are fewer extant documents written in this language than those written in Latin and German from the time of Vytautas. Later, Ruthenian became the main language of documentation and writing. In the years that followed, it was the main language of government until the introduction of Polish as the chancellery language of the Lithuanian–Polish Commonwealth in 1697; however there are also examples of documents written in Ruthenian from the second half of the 18th century.[8] The Lithuanian language was used orally in Vilnius, Trakai and Samogitian voivodeships, and by small numbers of people elsewhere. At the royal court in Vilnius of Sigismund II Augustus, the last Grand Duke of Lithuania prior to the Union of Lublin, both Polish and Lithuanian were spoken equally widely.[9]

After the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth on October 24, 1795, between the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy, the Commonwealth ceased to exist and Lithuania became a part of the Russian empire. After the abolition of serfdom in 1861, the use of the Polish language noticeably increased in eastern Lithuania and western Belarus.[2] Many Lithuanians, living further east, were unable to receive the Lithuanian printed books smuggled into Lithuania by knygnešiai during the time of the ban on printing books in the Latin alphabet, and they switched to Polish. Although this also used the Latin alphabet, it was much less affected by the ban, because Polish was still used by the politically important class of the nobility, and also used predominantly in the biggest towns of Lithuania, and supported by the church.

The Lithuanian National Revival had begun to intensify by the end of the 19th century, and the number of Lithuanian speakers and people identifying themselves as ethnic Lithuanians started to increase; but at the same time many Polish speaking Lithuanians, especially former szlachta, cut themselves adrift from the Lithuanian nation. There were population losses due to several border changes, Soviet deportations, the Holocaust of the Lithuanian Jews, and German and Polish repatriations during and after World War II. After World War II, the ethnic Lithuanian population remained stable: 79.3% in 1959 to 83.5% in 2002. Lithuania's citizenship law and the Constitution meet international and OSCE standards, guaranteeing universal human and civil rights.

Lithuania has the largest difference between the life expectancy of men and women in the world, which is 11 years.

1 the figures of 1939 exclude the Klaipėda Region

Lithuanians are a Baltic ethnic group (i.e. Balts), closely related to neighbouring Latvians, who speak Lithuanian, a Baltic language of the Indo-European language family. The group is distinct from neighbouring Slavic and Germanic peoples, although the historical union with Poland in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well German and Russian colonization and settlement left cultural and religious influences.

1 Source: [1]. The Klaipėda Region was annexed from Germany in 1923, but was not included in the 1923 census. A separate census in the Klaipėda region was held in 1925.

Among the Baltic states, Lithuania has the most homogeneous population. According to the census conducted in 2021, 84.6% of the population identified themselves as Lithuanians, 6.5% as Poles, 5.0% as Russians, 1.0% as Belarusians, and 2.3% as members of other ethnic groups.

Poles are concentrated in the Vilnius Region, the area controlled by Poland in the interwar period. There are especially large Polish communities in Vilnius district municipality (47% of the population) and Šalčininkai district municipality (76%). The Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, an ethnic minority political party, has strong influence in these areas and has representation in the Seimas. The party is most active in local politics and controls several municipal councils.

Russians, even though they are almost as numerous as Poles, are much more evenly scattered and lack strong political cohesion. The most prominent community lives in Visaginas (47%). Most of them are engineers who moved with their families from the Russian SFSR to work at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant. A number of ethnic Russians (mostly military) left Lithuania after the declaration of independence in 1990.

Another major change in the ethnic composition of Lithuania was the extermination of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. Before World War II about 7.5% of the population was Jewish; they were concentrated in cities and towns and had a significant influence on crafts and business. They were called Litvaks and had a strong culture. The population of Vilnius, sometimes nicknamed Northern Jerusalem, was about 30% Jewish. Almost all of these Jews were killed during the Nazi German occupation, or later emigrated to the United States and Israel. Now there are only about 4,000 Jews living in Lithuania.

Lithuania's membership of the European Union has made Lithuanian citizenship all the more appealing. Lithuanian citizenship is theoretically easier (see court ruling notes below) to obtain than that of many other European countries—only one great-grandparent is necessary to become a Lithuanian citizen. Persons who held citizenship in the Republic of Lithuania prior to June 15, 1940, and their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren (provided that these persons did not repatriate) are eligible for Lithuanian citizenship [8].

Lithuanian citizens are allowed to travel and work throughout the European Union without a visa or other restrictions.

The Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled in November 2006 that a number of provisions of the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on citizenship are in conflict with the Lithuanian Constitution. In particular, the court ruled that a number of current provisions of the Citizenship Law implicitly or explicitly allowing dual citizenship are in conflict with the Constitution; such provisions amounted to the unconstitutional practice of making dual citizenship a common phenomenon rather than a rare exception. The provisions of the Citizenship Law announced to be unconstitutional are no longer valid and applicable to the extent stated by the Constitutional Court.

The Lithuanian Parliament amended the Citizenship Law substantially as a result of this court ruling, allowing dual citizenship for children of at least one Lithuanian parent who are born abroad, but preventing Lithuanians from retaining their Lithuanian citizenship after obtaining the citizenship of another country.

There are some special cases still permitting dual citizenship.  See Lithuanian nationality law.

The Lithuanian language is the country's sole official language countrywide. It is the first language of over 85% of population and is also spoken by 295,244 out of 432,643 non-Lithuanians.[20] Ethnic minorities, such as the Polish population that mostly speaks Polish; Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians who immigrated after World War II and converse in Russian, generally use their associated languages as their main language.[21]

Nearly every citizen of Lithuania is considered to be at least bilingual, with the older generations being able to speak Russian as a second language, as the Soviet era had imposed the official use of Russian, while the independence generations usually speak English as their second language.[22] According to the census of 2021, 31% of the population can speak English, 67.4% – Russian.[20] The average Lithuanian knows 2.7 languages with a substantial portion of the total population (37%) speaking at least two foreign languages.[23]

Approximately 14,800 pupils started their 2012 school year in schools where the curriculum is conducted in Russian (down from 76,000 in 1991), and about 12,300 enrolled in Polish schools (compared to 11,400 in 1991 and 21,700 in 2001). There are also schools in the Belarusian language, as well as in English, German, and French.[24][25]

There are perhaps 50 speakers of Karaim, a Turkic language spoken by Karaite Jews, in Lithuania.[26]

Lithuanian Sign Language and Russian Sign Language are used by the deaf community.

Baltic Romani is spoken by the Lithuanian Roma (Gypsy) minority.[27]

As per the 2011 census, 77.2% of Lithuanians identified themselves as Roman Catholic.[28] The Church has been the majority denomination since the Christianisation of Lithuania at the end of the 14th century. Some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime (symbolised by the Hill of Crosses).

In the first half of the 20th century, the Lutheran Protestant church had around 200,000 members, 9% of the total population, mostly Protestant Lithuanians from the former Memel Territory and Germans, but it has declined since 1945. Small Protestant communities are dispersed throughout the northern and western parts of the country. Believers and clergy suffered greatly during the Soviet occupation, with many killed, tortured or deported to Siberia. Various Protestant churches have established missions in Lithuania since 1990.[29] 4.1% are Orthodox, 0.8% are Old Believers (both mainly among the Russian minority), 0.8% are Protestant and 6.1% have no religion.

Lithuania was historically home to a significant Jewish community and was an important center of Jewish scholarship and culture from the 18th century, until the community, numbering about 160,000 before World War II, was almost entirely annihilated during the Holocaust.[30][31] By 2011, around 3000 people in Lithuania identified themselves as Jews, while around 1200 identified with Judaic religious community.[32][33]

According to the 2005 Eurobarometer Poll,[34] 12% said that ""they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force"", 36% answered that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"" and 49% of Lithuanian citizens responded that ""they believe there is a God"".[dead link]

According to the 2011 census, only around 0.2% of the Lithuanian population aged 10 and over were illiterate, the majority of them in rural areas. The proportion is similar for males and females.[35]

The general education system in Lithuania consists of primary, basic, secondary and tertiary education. Primary, basic and secondary (or high school) education is free of charge to all residents and is compulsory for pupils under 16 years of age.[36] Pre-primary education is also available free of charge to 5- and 6-year-old children but is not compulsory. Pre-primary schooling is attended by about 90% of pre-school age children in Lithuania.[37] Primary, basic and secondary education in Lithuania is available to some ethnic minorities in their native languages, including Polish, Russian and Belarusian.

Primary schooling (Lithuanian: pradinis ugdymas) is available to children who have reached age 7 (or younger, should the parents so desire) and lasts four years. Primary school students are not assessed through a grade system, instead using oral or written feedback. Students begin studying their first foreign language in their second year of primary school.[38] Data from the 2011 census showed that 99.1% of the population aged 20 and older have attained at least primary education, while around 27,000 pupils started the first grade in 2012.[39]

Basic education (Lithuanian: pagrindinis ugdymas) covers grades 5 to 10. It is provided by basic, secondary, youth, vocational schools and gymnasiums. After completing the 10th grade, the students must take the basic education achievement test in the Lithuanian language, mathematics, and an elective basic education achievement test in their mother tongue (Belarusian, Polish, Russian or German).[36] In 2011, 90.9% of the population of Lithuania aged 20 or older had attained the basic level of education.[39]

Secondary education (Lithuanian: vidurinis ugdymas) in Lithuania is optional and available to students who have attained basic education. It covers two years (11th–12th grades in secondary schools and 3rd–4th grades in gymnasiums). At this level, students have the opportunity to adapt their study plans (subjects and study level) to their individual preferences.[38] Secondary education is completed upon passing national matura examinations. These consist of as many as six separate examinations of which two (Lithuanian Language and Literature and one elective subject) are required to attain the diploma. As of 2011, 78.2% of the population of Lithuania aged 20 or older had attained the secondary level of education, including secondary education provided by vocational schools.[39]

More than 60% of the graduates from secondary school every year choose to continue education at colleges and universities of the Lithuanian higher education system. As of 2013, there were 23 universities (including academies and business schools recognized as such) and 24 colleges operating in Lithuania. Vilnius University, founded in 1579, is the oldest and largest university in Lithuania. More than 48,000 students enrolled in all higher education programmes in Lithuania in 2011, including level I (professional bachelor and bachelor), level II (masters) and level III (doctorate) studies.[40] Higher education in Lithuania is partly state-funded, with free-of-charge access to higher education constitutionally guaranteed to students deemed ""good"". There are also scholarships available to the best students.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Lithuania
History of Lithuania (book),"History of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos istorija) or Academic History of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Akademinė Lietuvos istorija) is a thirteen-volume series of books dedicated to the history of Lithuania. The project is organised by the Lithuanian Institute of History, with the assistance of various Lithuanian universities.

The first volume was published in 2005, and its last volume is scheduled for publication in 2011. After its completion, it will be the largest and the most comprehensive academic publication covering Lithuania's history ever released.[1]  As of 2011, five volumes had been released.

After Lithuania regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, a number of academic works were published by prominent historians of the state's history. These included Edvardas Gudavičius‘  ""Lietuvos istorija. Nuo seniausių laikų iki 1569 metų"" (English: History of Lithuania. From ancient times to the year 1569) in 1999;  Zigmantas Kiaupa's ""Lietuvos valstybės istorija"" (English: History of the State of Lithuania) in 2004; and Alfredas Bumblauskas’  ""Senosios Lietuvos istorija 1009–1795"" (English: The Early History of Lithuania from 1009-1795) in 2005. However, the majority of these were dedicated to specific time frames and did not cover the entire period from prehistory to the modern era. The first proposal to issue a complete history may be credited to Professor Antanas Tyla.[2] The suggestion was reinforced by academic Vytautas Merkys. The opportunity to issue a fundamental and comprehensive academic work arose in 2000 when a programme sponsored by the Lithuanian Institute of History, coordinated by prof. habil. dr. Jūratė Kiaupienė, was approved.[2]

Per the approved programme, each volume of the Academic History will cover a particular historical time frame, and its thirteen volumes will encompass Lithuania's entire history. After its completion, it will be the largest academic publication covering Lithuania's history ever released and will include the latest research findings.[1] Its intent is to transcend narrow historical perspectives and to focus on the evolution of Lithuania.[3] Political, ethical, confessional, and judicial themes will be covered in a European context, and the modern works of Ukrainian, Russian, and other states' historians will be examined.[4]

Initially, twelve volumes were planned, but after the work began it became evident that coverage of modern Lithuanian history would require an additional volume.[2] The successive volumes will be the same size - 25.5 cm x 16.5 cm.[3] The editorial board of the series consists of the following scholars: habil. dr. Algirdas Girininkas, dr. Artūras Dubonis, prof. dr. Zigmantas Kiaupa, prof. habil. dr. Jūratė Kiaupienė, dr. Česlovas Laurinavičius, dr. Rimantas Miknys, dr. Gintautas Sliesoriūnas, and dr. Gintautas Zabiela. More than 20 scholars are working on this project.[5] Each volume is peer-reviewed and has an additional responsible editor. The Lithuanian Institute of History is acting in cooperation with Lithuanian universities, including Vilnius University, increasing scholarly involvement in the project.

The series' first volume, ""Lietuvos istorija. Akmens amžius ir ankstyvasis metalų leikotrapis"" (English: History of Lithuania. Stone Age and Early Metal Era), was released in 2005. This volume covers the period between the end of the last ice age and the first written mention of the inhabitants in the Baltic region.[6] It covers approximately 10,000 years, investigating the development of communities during the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras and the Bronze Age in a local and European context.[6] Forest dwellers are examined along with agrarian societies. It features an improved periodisation of epochs, and social developments are analyzed using not only archaeological findings, but the methodologies of the natural sciences as well.[7] The genesis and evolution of particular local cultures such as Mesolithic Nemunas and Neolithic Nemunas is discussed.[8]

The 357-page volume was written by authors known for their fieldwork in archeology and the prehistory of Lithuania: dr. Tomas Ostrauskas, dr. Vygandas Juodagalvis, hab. dr. Algirdas Girininkas ir dr. Džiugas Brazaitis. Its responsible editor was Algirdas Girininkas. The volume was peer-reviewed by prof. habil. dr. Vladas Žulkus and dr. Algimantas Merkevičius.[9]

The second volume, entitled ""Lietuvos istorija. Geležies amžius"" (English: History of Lithuania. The Iron Age), was issued in 2007. It encompassed the era between the 1st century and the 12th century.[3] Invoking archaeological research, it discusses Lithuania's formation and development, and the impacts made by the Vikings and by Rus.[3] An in-depth analysis was made of the evolution of the Baltic tribes in the region since these Lithuanians were the only Balts to create their own state.[10]

The volume was written by dr. Gintautas Zabiela, habil. dr. Vytautas Kazakevičius, dr. Ilona Vaškevičiūtė, dr. Rasa Banytė Rowell, and dr. Darius Baronas; the responsible editor was Gintautas Zabiela. During the volume's preparation, Vytautas Kazakevičius died, and his work was finished by Zabiela.  The 517-page volume was peer-reviewed by dr. Albinas Kuncevičius and dr. Mindaugas Bertašius.[11]

In 2008 was released another volume of the book entitled ""Sąjūdis: nuo ""Persitvarkymo"" iki Kovo 11-osios"" (English: History of Lithuania. Sąjūdis: from ""Restructuring"" till March 11). Volume is written by dr. Česlovas Laurinavičius and dr. Vladas Sirutavičius. Currently available I part of the XII volume.

The third volume will begin with the 12th century; the thirteenth and last volume will cover the 21st century. The last volume is scheduled for release in about 2011. According to a preliminary assessment, the remaining volumes will be organized and edited as follows:[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lithuania_(book)

Economy of Lithuania,"The economy of Lithuania is the largest economy among the three Baltic states.[35][36] Lithuania is a member of the European Union and belongs to the group of very high human development countries and is a member of the WTO and OECD.

In the 1990s, Lithuania rapidly moved from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, implementing numerous liberal reforms. It enjoyed high growth rates after joining the European Union along with the other Baltic states, leading to the notion of a Baltic Tiger. Lithuania's economy (GDP) grew more than 500 percent since regaining independence in 1990. The Baltic states have a combined workforce of 3.3 million people, with 1.5 million of these working people living in Lithuania.

The country is one of the fastest growing economies in the EU.[37] GDP growth reached its peak in 2008, and was approaching the same levels again in 2018.[38] Similar to the other Baltic States, the Lithuanian economy suffered a deep recession in 2009, with GDP falling by almost 15%. After this severe recession, the country's economy started to show signs of recovery already in the 3rd quarter of 2009. It returned to growth in 2010, with a positive 1.3 outcome and with 6.6 per cent growth during the first half of 2011. GDP growth had resumed in 2010, albeit at a slower pace than before the crisis.[39][40] The success of the crisis taming is attributed to the austerity policy of the Lithuanian government.[41]

Lithuania has a sound fiscal position. The 2017 budget resulted in a 0.5% surplus, with the gross debt stabilising at around 40% of the GDP. The budget remained positive in 2017, and was expected to continue to do so in 2018.[42]

Foreign direct investment into Lithuania has been spiking every year since 2015, with significant increasements in 2020s, reaching its highest ever recorded number in 2023.[43] On average, around 80% of all foreign direct investment in Lithuania comes from European Union countries. Sweden was historically the largest investor with 20% – 30% of all FDI in Lithuania,[44] but it has been overtaken by Germany, the Netherlands and even Estonia in the 2010s. In 2017, Lithuania was the third country, after the Republic of Ireland and Singapore by the average job value of investment projects.[45] Lithuania is ranked 11th in the world in the Ease of Doing Business Index prepared by the World Bank Group,[46] 16th out of 178 countries in the Index of Economic Freedom, measured by The Heritage Foundation[47] and 8th out of 165 countries in the Economic Freedom of the World 2021[48] by Fraser Institute.

Based on OECD data, Lithuania is among the top 5 countries in the world by postsecondary (tertiary) education attainment.[49] This educated workforce attracted investments, especially in the ICT sector during the past years. The Lithuanian government and the Bank of Lithuania simplified procedures for obtaining licences for the activities of e-money and payment institutions.[50] positioning the country as one of the most attractive for the financial technology initiatives in the EU.

The history of Lithuania can be divided into seven major periods. All the periods have some interesting and important facts that affected the economic situation of the country in those times.

The first Lithuanians formed a branch of an ancient ethno-linguistic group known as the Balts. Up to the 4th century, Lithuanian tribes maintained close trade contacts with the Roman Empire[51][self-published source?] via Aquileia processing center and Carnuntum.[52][53] Amber was the main good provided to the Roman Empire from Baltic Sea coast, via a long route called the Amber Road.

Afterwards, the trading ties persisted with the central European tribes, fostering a consistent exchange of goods. Alongside the most prized commodity of amber, items such as leathers, furs, beeswax, and limited algicultural productss were among the other traded commodities.[52] The connections can be seen through the shared name for amber - the Hungarian gyanta, gyantar are closely related to the Lithuanian gintaras. It's still debated which language group could have loaned the word from another.[52]

Consolidation of the Lithuanian lands began in the late 12th century. King Mindaugas was the first Catholic King of Lithuania in 1253. The expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the Grand Duke Gediminas (reigned 1316–1341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the Hanseatic league, offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and knights to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke Kęstutis (1297–1382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).

In 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth formed through the union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland–Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.[citation needed] There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel – vytinė, used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. Statutes of Lithuania were the main collections of law statements and rules for nearly three centuries since being published in 1529.

The Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called Constitution of 3 May, declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the United States Constitution). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the Szlachta, were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.

Following the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the Russian Empire controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of capitalism. However, Lithuania, as did its neighbouring provinces, remained an agricultural supplier for the post Industrial Revolution European markets.

Lithuania had stagnant economic growth in the interwar period (1919–1940).[54] Its GDP growth resembled newly established agricultureal states such as Estonia and Poland.[54] Lithuania's economy did not undergo contraction during the Great Depression.[54]

On 16 February 1918, the Council of Lithuania passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania. Soon, many economic reforms for sustainable economic growth were implemented. A national currency, called the Lithuanian litas, was introduced in 1922. It proved to become one of the strongest and most stable currencies in Europe during the inter-war period.[55] Lithuania had a monometalism system where one litas was covered by 0.150462 grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. Litas remained stable even in the period of Great Depression. During the time of its independence, 1918–1940, Lithuania made substantial progress. For example, Lithuania was the third-ranking flax producer and exporter in the world market (export of flax constituted about 30 percent of all export share[56]), being surpassed only by Soviet Russia and Poland;[57] Lithuanian farm products such as meat, dairy products, many kinds of grain, potatoes, etc. were of superior quality in the world market. Lithuanian farmers were joining into cooperative companies – e.g. Lietūkis, Pienocentras, Linas, which helped farmers to process and sell their products more efficiently and profitably.

Having taken advantage of favorable international developments, and driven by its foreign policy aims directed against Lithuanian statehood, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) occupied Lithuania in 1940.[58] Land and the most important objects for the economy were nationalized, and most of the farms collectivized. Just after one year of occupation, poverty level, unemployment increased dramatically, lack of food products appeared. Later, many inefficient factories and industry companies, highly dependent on other regions of USSR, were established in Lithuania. Despite that, in 1990, GDP per capita of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was $8,591, which was above the average for the rest of the Soviet Union of $6,871 but lagging behind developed western countries.

The Soviet era brought Lithuania intensive industrialization and economic integration into the USSR, although the level of technology and state concern for environmental, health, and labor issues lagged far behind Western standards.[59] Urbanization increased from 39% in 1959 to 68% in 1989. From 1949 to 1952 the Soviets abolished private ownership in agriculture, establishing collective and state farms. Production declined and did not reach pre-war levels until the early 1960s. The intensification of agricultural production through intense chemical use and mechanization eventually doubled production but created additional ecological problems. This changed after independence, when farm production dropped due to difficulties in restructuring the agricultural sector.[59]

The overall damage, resulted from the Soviet occupation (including the loss of gross domestic product), estimated according to the UN recognised methodologies amounted to approximately US$800 billion; direct damage (including genocide and deportations of the citizens, property looting) estimation is US$20 billion.[60]

According to a 2019 study by economic historians, Lithuania had above average economic growth from 1937 to 1973 (when compared to other economies), but below average growth from 1973 to 1990.[61]

Reforms since the mid-1990s led to an open and rapidly growing economy. Open to global trade and investment, Lithuania now enjoys high degrees of business, fiscal, and financial freedom. Lithuania is a member of the EU and the WTO, so regulation is relatively transparent and efficient, with foreign and domestic capital subject to the same rules. The financial sector is advanced, regionally integrated, and subject to few intrusive regulations.[47]

One of Lithuania's most important reforms was the privatization of state-owned assets. The first stage of privatization was being implemented between 1991 and 1995. Citizens were given investment vouchers worth €3.1 billion in nominal value, which let them participate in assets selling.[62] By October 1995, they were used as follows: 65% for acquisition of shares; 19% for residential dwellings; 5% for agricultural properties; and 7% remained unused.[62] More than 5,700 enterprises with €2.0 billion worth of state capital in book value were sold using four initial privatization methods: share offerings; auctions; best business plans competitions; and hard currency sales.[62]

The second privatization step began in 1995 by approving a new law that ensured greater diversity of privatization methods and that enabled participation in the selling process without vouchers. Between 1996 and 1998, 526 entities were sold for more than €0.7 billion.[62] Before the reforms, the public sector totally dominated the economy, whereas the share of the private sector in GDP increased to over 70% by the 2000 and 80% in 2011.[63]

Monetary reform was undertaken in the early nineties to improve the stability of the economy. Lithuania chose a currency board system controlled by the Bank of Lithuania independent of any government institution. On 25 June 1993, the Lithuanian litas was introduced as a freely convertible currency, but on 1 April 1994 it was pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of 4 to 1. The mechanism of the currency board system enabled Lithuania to stabilize inflation rates to single digits. The stable currency rate helped to establish foreign economic relations, therefore leading[citation needed] to a constant growth of foreign trade.[64]

By 1998, the economy had survived the early years of uncertainty and several setbacks, including a banking crisis. However, the collapse of the Russian ruble in August 1998 shocked the economy into negative growth and forced the reorientation of trade from Russia towards the West.[59] In 1997, exports to the Soviet Union's successor entity (the Commonwealth of Independent States) made up 45% of total Lithuanian exports. This share of exports dropped to 21% of the total in 2006, while exports to EU members increased to 63% of the total.[59] Exports to the United States made up 4.3% of all Lithuania's exports in 2006, and imports from the United States comprised 2% of total imports. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2005 was €0.8 billion.

Lithuania was invited to the Helsinki EU summit in December 1999 to begin EU accession talks in early 2000.[65] On 2 February 2002 the litas was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.4528 to 1, which remained until Lithuania adopted the euro in 2015. Lithuania was very close to introducing the euro in 2007, but the inflation level exceeded the Maastricht requirements.[66] On 1 January 2015, Lithuania became the 19th country to use the euro.[67]

The Vilnius Stock Exchange, now renamed the NASDAQ OMX Vilnius, started its activity in 1993 and was the first stock exchange in the Baltic states. In 2003, the VSE was acquired by OMX. Since 27 February 2008 the Vilnius Stock Exchange has been a member of NASDAQ OMX Group, which is the world's largest exchange company across six continents, with over 3,800 listed companies.[68] The market cap of Vilnius Stock Exchange was €3.4 billion on 27 November 2009.[69]

During the last decade (1998–2008) the structure of Lithuania's economy has changed significantly. The biggest changes were recorded in the agricultural sector as the share of total employment decreased from 19.2% in 1998 to just 7.9% in 2008. The service sector plays an increasingly important role. The share of GDP in financial intermediation and real estate sectors was 17% in 2008 compared to 11% in 1998. The share of total employment in the financial sector in 2008 has doubled compared with 1998.[70][71]

Between 2000 and 2017, the Lithuanian GDP grew by 308%.[72]

One of the most important factors contributing to Lithuania's economic growth was its accession to the WTO in 2001 and the EU in 2004, which allows free movement of labour, capital, and trade among EU member states. On the other hand, rapid growth caused some imbalances in inflation and balance of payments. The current account deficit to GDP ratio in 2006–2008 was in the double digits and reached its peak in the first quarter of 2008 at a threatening 18.8%.[73] This was mostly due to rapid loan portfolio growth as Scandinavian banks provided cheap credit under quite lax rules in Lithuania. The volume of loans to acquire lodgings has grown from 50 million LTL in 2004 up to 720 million LTL in 2007.[citation needed] Consumption was affected by credit expansion as well. This led to high inflation of goods and services, as well as trade deficit. A housing bubble was formed.

The global credit crunch which started in 2008 affected the real estate and retail sectors. The construction sector shrank by 46.8% during the first three-quarters of 2009 and the slump in retail trade was almost 30%.[39][74] GDP plunged by 15.7% in the first nine months of 2009.[39]

Lithuania was the last among the Baltic states to be hit by recession because its GDP growth rate in 2008 was still positive, followed by a slump of more than 15% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, compared to the previous quarter, GDP again grew by 6.1% after five-quarters with negative numbers.[39] Austerity policy (four-fifths of the fiscal adjustment consisted of expenditure cuts)[75] introduced by the Kubilius government helped to balance the current account from −15.5 in 2007 to 1.6 in 2009.[76] Economic sentiment and confidence of all business activities have rebounded from a record low at the beginning of the year 2009.

Sectors related to domestic consumption and real estate still suffer from the economic crisis, but exporters have started making profits even with lower levels of revenue. The catalysts of growing profit margins are lower raw material prices and staff expense.

At the end of 2017, investment of Lithuania's enterprises abroad amounted to EUR 2.9 billion. The largest investment was made in Netherlands (24.1 per cent of the total direct investment abroad), Cyprus (19.8 per cent), Latvia (14.9 per cent), Poland (10.5 per cent) and Estonia (10.3 per cent). Lithuania's direct investment in the EU member states totalled EUR 2.6 billion, or 89.3 per cent of the total direct investment abroad.[77]

Based on the Eurostat's data, in 2017, the value of Lithuanian exports recorded the most rapid growth not only in the Baltic countries, but also across Europe, which was 16.9 per cent.[78] Lithuania performs well in few measures of well-being in the Better Life Index by OECD, ranking above the average in education and skills, and work-life balance. It is below the average in income and wealth, jobs and earnings, housing, health status, social connections, civic engagement, environmental quality, personal security, and subjective well-being.[79] Lithuanian people are the happiest people in the Baltic States.[80][81]

On 1 January 2015, Lithuania became the 19th country to adopt the euro. Joining the euro would relieve the Bank of Lithuania of defending the value of the litas, and ""it would give Lithuania a say in the decision-making of the European Central Bank (ECB), as well as access to the ECB single-resolution fund and cheaper borrowing costs"".[67]

In 2024, Lithuania ranks 9th in the International Tax Competitiveness Index, confirming its attractiveness for business. In the Index of Economic Freedom, this European country ranks 15th, and 11th in the Ease of Doing Business Index, underscoring its status as one of the most favorable jurisdictions for entrepreneurship in Europe.[82]

Cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2017 was EUR 14.7 billion, or 35 per cent of GDP, EUR 5215 per capita.[83] The largest FDI flow in Lithuania was into manufacturing (EUR 73.7 million), agriculture, forestry, fishery (EUR 27.4 million), information and communication (EUR 10 million).  Sweden, The Netherlands and Germany have remained the largest investors.[83]

Lithuania seeks to become an innovation hub by 2020. To reach this goal, it is putting its efforts into attracting FDI to added-value sectors, especially IT services, software development, consulting, finance, and logistics.[84] Well-known international companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Transcom, Barclays, Siemens, SEB, TeliaSonera, Paroc, Wix.com, Philip Morris, Thermo Fisher Scientific established a presence in Lithuania.

Lithuanian FEZs (Free economic zone) offer developed infrastructure, service support, and tax incentives. A company set up in an FEZ is exempt from corporate taxation for its first six years, as well as a tax on dividends and real estate tax.[85]
7 FEZ operate in Lithuania – Marijampolė Free Economic Zone, Kaunas Free Economic Zone, Klaipėda Free Economic Zone, Panevėžys Free Economic Zone, Akmenė Free Economic Zone, Šiauliai Free Economic Zone, Kėdainiai Free Economic Zone.
There are nine industrial sites in Lithuania, which can also provide additional advantages by having a well-developed infrastructure, offering consultancy service and tax incentives.[86] Lithuania is ranked third among developed economies by the quantity (16) of Special Economic Zones – after USA (256) and Poland (21).[87]

Lithuanian municipalities provide special incentives to investors who create jobs or invest in infrastructure. Municipalities may tie designation criteria to additional factors, such as the number of jobs created or environmental benefits. Strategic investors' benefits could include favorable tax incentives for up to ten years. Municipalities may grant special incentives to induce investments in municipal infrastructure, manufacturing, and services.[88]

About 40 percent of surveyed investors confirmed that they are carrying out Research and experimental development (R&D) or plan to do it in their Lithuanian branches.[89] In 2018 Lithuania ranked as the second most attractive location for manufacturers in the Manufacturing Risk Index 2018.[90] In 2019, Lithuania was 16th in Top 20 European FDI destination countries list, created by the Ernst & Young.[91]

Lithuania is divided into ten counties. There are four cities with a population over 100,000 and two cities of over 50,000 people. The gross regional product is concentrated in the two largest counties – Vilnius and Kaunas. These two counties account for two-thirds of the GDP with just 50% of the population.[92]

In 2023-Q3 Vilnius County was the only one with the average salary above the national average, while Utena County had the lowest with 20% below it.[93]

In order to achieve balanced regional distribution of GDP, nine public industrial parks (Akmene Industrial Park, Alytus Industrial Park, Kedainiai Industrial Park, Marijampolė Industrial Park, Pagegiai Industrial Park, Panevėžys Industrial Park, Radviliskis Industrial Park, Ramygala Industrial Park and Šiauliai Industrial Park) and three private industrial parks (Tauragė Private Industrial Park, Sitkunai Private Industrial Park, Ramučiai Private Logistic and Industrial Park) were established to provide some tax incentives and prepared physical infrastructure.[86]

In 2022, the sector with the highest number of companies registered in Lithuania is Services with 53,386 companies followed by Unknown industry and Wholesale Trade with 50,660 and 26,974 companies respectively.[95]

One of the most important sub-sectors is information and communication technologies (ICT). Around 37,000 employees work for more than 2,000 ICT companies. ICT received 9.5% of total FDI. Lithuania hosts 13 of the 20 largest IT companies in the Baltic States.[96] Lithuania exported EUR 128 million worth ICT services in II quarter of 2018.

Development of shared services and business process outsourcing are some of the most promising fields. Companies that have outsourced their business operations to Lithuania include, Danske Bank, CITCO Group, Western Union, Uber, MIRROR, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Anthill, Adform, Booking Holdings (Kayak.com, Booking.com), HomeToGo, Visma, Unity, Yara International, Nasdaq Nordic, Bentley Systems, Ernst & Young and many more.

The financial sector concentrates mostly on the domestic market. There are thirteen commercial banks that hold a license from the Bank of Lithuania and eight foreign bank branches.[97] Most of the banks belong to international corporations, mainly Scandinavian. The financial sector has demonstrated incredible growth in the pre-crisis period (1998–2008). Bank assets were only €3.2 billion or 25.5% from GDP in 2000, half of which consisted of loan portfolio.[98]

By the beginning of the year 2009, bank assets grew to €26.0 billion or 80.8% to GDP, the loan portfolio reached €20.7 billion.[99] The loan-to-GDP ratio was 64%. The growth of deposits was not as fast as that of loans. At the end of 2008, the loan portfolio was almost twice as big as that of deposits. It demonstrated high dependence on external financing. Contraction in the loan portfolio has been recorded over the past year, so the loans to deposits ratio are slowly getting back to healthy levels.

Moody's Corporation declared about opening its office in Vilnius.[100]

The country has increasingly sought to position itself as the EU's main fintech hub, hoping to attract international firms by promising to provide European operational licences within three months, compared to a waiting period of up to a year in countries like Germany or the UK.[101] In 2017 only, 35[102] FinTech companies came to Lithuania – a result of Lithuanian government and Bank of Lithuania simplified procedures for obtaining licences for the activities of e-money and payment institutions.[50] Europe's first international Blockchain Centre launched in Vilnius in 2018.[103] Since 2021, Lithuania has issued hundreds of licenses for cryptocurrency exchange and storage services, making it one of the leading countries in the EU for such permits.[104] The government of Lithuania also aims to attract financial institutions looking for a new location after Brexit.[105][106] Lithuania has granted a total of 39 e-money licenses, second in the EU only to the U.K. with 128 licenses. In 2018, Google set up a payment company in Lithuania,[107] Vilnius was ranked a seventh FinTech city by foreign direct investment (FDI) performance in 2019.[108]

Bank of Lithuania, the Central Bank of Lithuania established a Regulatory sandbox[109] to test financial innovations in a live environment under the guidance and supervision of the Bank of Lithuania. Bank of Lithuania has also developed LBChain which is the world's first blockchain-based sandbox developed by a financial market regulator, combining technological and regulatory infrastructures.[110]

Lithuania has a much larger manufacturing sector share in the economy's structure than the other Baltic countries. In this regard, Lithuania is closer to some Central European countries like the Czech Republic or Germany.[111]

Manufacturing constitutes the biggest part of gross value added in Lithuania. The food processing sector constitutes 11% of total exports. Dairy products, especially cheese, are well known in neighbouring countries. Another important manufacturing activity is chemical products. The manufacturing of machinery and equipment sector in Lithuania comprises 7.1% of the country's GDP. 80% of production is exported so chemical products constitute 12.5% of total exports. Year 2019 was exemplary  – more than 10 new factories were opened in Lithuania, working in the fields in engineering, high precision instruments, furniture and medical products.

Furniture production employs more than 50,000 people and has seen double-digit growth over the last three years. The biggest companies in this field work in cooperation with IKEA, which owns one of the biggest wood processing companies in Lithuania. Lithuania is the fourth biggest supplier of furniture for IKEA after Poland, Italy and Germany.[112]

Continental AG in 2018 started to build a factory for high precision car electronics – the biggest greenfield investment project in Lithuania so far.[113] Another German manufacturer of lighting technology Hella opened a plant in 2018 in Kaunas FEZ, which will produce sensors, actuators and control modules for the automotive industry.[114] Lithuania's automotive cluster experienced significant growth during the past 5 years.

Companies in the automotive and engineering sector are relatively small but offer flexible services for small and non-standard orders at competitive prices. The sector employs about 3% of the working population and receives 5.6% of FDI.[115] Vilnius Gediminas Technical University prepares experts for the sector.

Lithuania's life science sector is growing around 20–25% annually; with special focus on the production and research of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical devices.[116]

Lithuanian laser companies were among the first ones in the world to transfer fundamental research into manufacturing. Lithuania's laser producers export laser technologies and devices to nearly 100 countries. Half of all picosecond lasers sold worldwide are produced by Lithuanian companies, while Lithuanian-made femtosecond parametric light amplifiers, used in generating the ultrashort laser pulses, account for as much as 80% of the world market.[117]

Tourism in Lithuania is becoming increasingly important for the local economy, constituting around 5.3% of GDP in 2016.[118] Lithuania has 22,000 rivers and rivulets, 3,000 lakes, a well-developed rural tourism network, a unique coastal area of almost 100 km and four UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Lithuania receives more than 1.4 million foreign tourists a year.[119] Germany, Poland, Russia, Latvia, and Belarus supply the most tourists, and a significant number arrive from the UK, the USA, Finland, and Italy as well.

Despite a decreased share in GDP, the agricultural sector is still important for Lithuania as it employs almost 8% of the work force and supplies materials for the food processing sector.[120] In 2023 it, together with food produsts, combined for 19.6% of all Lithuanian exports.[121] 44.8% of the land is arable[121] and the total agricultural area was 2.9 million hectares, of which 2.3 million ha were arable, in 2023.[122] Three connecting municipalities - Panevėžys district, Kupiškis and Raseiniai have the largest areas in the country.[122] Cereals, wheat, and triticale are the most popular production of farms. The number of livestock and poultry has decreased twofold compared to the 1990s. The number of cattle in Lithuania at the beginning of the year 2009 was 770,000, the number of dairy cows was 395,000, and the number of poultry was 9.1 million.[123]

Lithuanian food consumption has evolved; between 1992 and 2008, consumption of vegetables increased by 30% to 86 kg per capita, and consumption of meat and its products increased by 23% during the same period to 81 kg per capita.[124] On the other hand, consumption of milk and dairy products has decreased to 268 kg per capita by 21%, and the consumption of bread and grain products decreased to 114 kg per capita by 19% as well.[124]

In addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like apple (92 thousand tons), maize (87 thousand tons)and rye (44 thousand tons).[125]

Lithuania traditionally has strong agricultural, furniture, logistics, meatpacking & poultry, biotechnology and laser industries. 
Maxima is a retail chain operating in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Bulgaria and it is the largest Lithuanian capital company and the largest employer in the Baltic states. Girteka Logistics is Europe's largest transport company.[126] Biotechpharma [lt] is a biopharmaceutical research and development company with a focus on recombinant protein technology development. The BIOK Laboratory is a startup founded by biochemistry scientists which is the biggest producer of Lithuanian natural cosmetic products. UAB SANITEX is the largest wholesale, distribution and logistics company in Lithuania and Latvia, also active in Estonia and Poland. SoliTek – the largest photovoltaic module and energy storage battery manufacturer in Northern Europe. One of the leaders of cellular IoT gateways producers in Europe – UAB Teltonika.

In the ""Baltic Top 50"", the biggest Baltic states companies rating created by Coface, more than half – 27 – companies are from Lithuania. Together they account for 69.1% combined turnover, 67.1% net profit, and 76.2% employees of all the listed companies.[127]

The total revenue of the 1000 largest companies in Lithuania reached 77.9 billion euros in 2023, and seen a 2.6% year-to-year contraction.[128] There were the largest companies of Lithuania in 2023 financial year, by revenue:[129][130]

Largest Lithuanian companies by valuation (EUR € billions) according to 15min (2024).[131]

The number of the population aged 15 years and over is 1.45 million, activity rate was 60 percent in 2017.[132]

During the period of 1995–2017 average salary grew more than four times in Lithuania.[133] Despite this, labour costs in Lithuania are among the lowest in the EU. Average monthly net salary in IV quarter 2018 was EUR 800 and increased by 9.5 percent.
Unemployment in Lithuania has been volatile. Since the year 2001, the unemployment rate has decreased from almost 20% to less than 4% in 2007 thanks to two main reasons. Firstly, during the time of rapid economic expansion, numerous work places were established. This caused a decrease in the unemployment rate and a rise in staff expenses. Secondly, emigration has also reduced unemployment problems since accession to the EU. However, the economic crisis of year 2008 has lowered the need for workers, so the unemployment rate increased to 13.8% and then stabilized in the third quarter of 2009. Unemployment rate in I quarter of 2018 was 6.3 percent.[134]

Lithuania is among the top 5 countries in the world by postsecondary (tertiary) education attainment.[49]As of 2016[update], 54.9% of the population aged 25 to 34, and 30.7% of the population aged 55 to 64 had completed tertiary education.[135] The share of tertiary-educated 25–64-year-olds in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields in Lithuania were above the OECD average (29% and 26% respectively), similarly to business, administration and law (25% and 23% respectively).[136]

The level of labour productivity in Lithuania today is about one-third below the OECD average.[137] Lithuania is ranked 15th in Employment Flexibility Index.[138]

The following companies provided the most jobs (at least 1000 laborers) within the specific municipalities in 2024. Employment agencies are excluded from the list.[139]

Lithuania belongs to high income group according to Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2019.[141] As of 2019, Lithuanian average wealth per adult was $50,254 (an increase of 82% from $27,507 in the year 2017) [142] Household debt is among the lowest among EU countries – 49 percent of net disposable income in 2015.[143]

The transport, storage, and communication sector has increased its importance to the economy of Lithuania. In 2008, it accounted for 12.1% of GDP compared to 9.1% in 1996.[145]

Lithuania has a broadly developed radio, television, landline and mobile phone, as well as broadband internet networks.

Lithuanian National Radio and Television, the public broadcaster in Lithuania operates 3 television channels, including a satellite channel, as well as 3 radio stations. Privately owned commercial TV and Radio broadcasters operate a multitude national, regional and local channels.[146]

There are four TIER III datacenters in Lithuania.[147]
Lithuania is 44th globally ranked country on data center density according to Cloudscene.[148]

The fixed landline network connects 625 thousand households and businesses (down from the record 845 thousand in 2005).[149] The decline in subscription and utilization of the landline network has been driven by increased availability of mobile phone services. The mobile telephony penetration rate in Lithuania (of 151 per 100 population in 2013) has been one of the highest in the world.[150] In 2013, there were 13 providers of mobile phone services, with the three largest ones – BITĖ Lietuva, Omnitel, and Tele2 – operating their own cellular networks.

Lithuanian retail internet sector is competitive, with more than 100 service providers. Retail internet connectivity in Lithuania was among the cheapest in Europe; however, the internet penetration rate (64% of households using internet in 2013) was lower than in other EU countries in the region – Estonia (79%), Latvia (70%) and Poland (69%). Lithuanian internet connection speeds have been claimed to be among the fastest in the world[151] based on user-initiated tests at Speedtest.net.

The utilities sector accounts for more than 3% of gross value added in Lithuania. Electricity production exceeded 12 billion kWh in 2007, and consumption exceeded 9.6 billion kWh. Surplus electricity is exported.

Lithuania operated a nuclear power plant in Visaginas, which produced 72% of electricity in Lithuania.[152] The plant was shut down on 31 December 2009 in line with the commitments made when Lithuania joined EU in 2004. A new nuclear power plant in Visaginas has been proposed but the status of the project is uncertain after it was rejected by the voters in a referendum in 2012.

The supply of heating energy was modernized during the decade (1998–2008). Technological loss in the heat energy system has decreased significantly from 26.2% in the year 2000 to 16.7% in 2008. The amount of air pollution was reduced by one-third. The share of renewable energy resources in the total fuel balance for heat production increased to almost 20%.

In order to break down Gazprom's monopoly[153][154] in the natural gas market of Lithuania, the first large scale LNG import terminal (Klaipėda LNG FSRU) in the Baltic region was built in the port of Klaipėda in 2014. The Klaipėda LNG terminal was called Independence, thus emphasising the aim to diversify the energy market of Lithuania. Norvegian company Equinor supplies 540 million cubic metres (19 billion cubic feet) of natural gas annually from 2015 until 2020.[155] The terminal is able to cover 100% of Lithuania's demand and 90% of Latvia's and Estonia's national demand in the future.[156]

Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant operates as pumped-storage providing a spinning reserve of the power system, in order to regulate the load curve of the power system 24 hours a day. In 2015 Kruonis Industrial Park was established as a place for data centers.[157]

In 2018 synchronising the Baltic States' electricity grid with the Synchronous grid of Continental Europe has started.[158]

Lithuania forms part of the transport corridor between the East and the West. The volume of goods transported by road transport has increased fivefold since 1996. The total length of roadways is more than 80,000 km, and 90% of them are paved.[120] The government spending on road infrastructure exceeded €0.5 billion in 2008. Via Baltica highway passes through Kaunas, while membership in the Schengen Agreement allows for smooth border crossing to Poland and Latvia.

Rail transport in Lithuania provides long-distance passenger and cargo services. Railways carry approximately 50 million tons of cargo and 7 million passengers a year.[159] Direct rail routes link Lithuania with Russia, Belarus, Latvia, Poland, and Germany. Also, the main transit route between Russia and Russia's Kaliningrad Region passes through Lithuania. Lithuanian Railways AB transports about 44% of the freight carried through Lithuania.[160] This is a very high indicator compared to other EU countries, where freight transportation by rail amounts to only 10% of the total.[161]

An ice-free seaport of Klaipeda is located in the western part of Lithuania. The port is an important regional transport hub connecting the sea, land and railway routes from east and west. It handles roughly 7,000 ships and 30 million tons of cargo every year, and accepts large-tonnage vessels (dry-cargo vessels up to 70,000 DWT, tankers up to 100,000 DWT and cruise ships up to 270 meters long). The seaport of Klaipėda is able to receive Panamax-type vessels.[159] One of the fastest growing segments of sea transport is passenger traffic, which has increased fourfold since 2002. The inland river cargo port in Marvelė, linking Kaunas and Klaipėda, received first cargo in 2019.[162]

Lithuania has four international airports – Vilnius Airport (VNO), Kaunas Airport (KUN), Šiauliai Airport (SQQ) and Palanga Airport (PLQ). More than 30 domestic airports being used by aeroclubs and amateur pilots.

There are more than 600,000 m2 of modern logistics and warehousing facilities in Lithuania.[163] The biggest supply of new, modern warehousing facilities is in the capital city Vilnius (after the completion of several new projects in the third quarter of 2009, the supply of modern warehousing premises has increased by nearly 12% in Vilnius and currently reaches 334,400 m2 of the rentable area). Kaunas is in the second place (around 200,000 m2), and Klaipėda in the third (122,500 m2).[159] Since the beginning of the year 2009, prices for warehousing premises have dropped by 20–25% in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda, and the current level of rents has reached the level of 2003.[163] The costs for renting new warehouses in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda are similar and reach 0.75 to 1.42 EUR/m2, while the rents of old warehouses are 0.35 to 0.67 EUR/m2.

Lithuanian economy is highly open and International trade is crucial. As a result, the ratio of foreign trade to GDP for Lithuania has often exceeded 100%.

The EU is the biggest trade partner of Lithuania with a 67% of total imports and 61.3% of total exports during 2015.[164] The Commonwealth of Independent States is the second economic union that Lithuania trades the most with, with a share of imports of 25% and a share of exports of 23.9% during the same period.[164] The vast majority of commodities, including oil, gas, and metals have to be imported, mainly from Russia, however in the recent years Lithuania's energy dependence has shifted towards other countries such as Norway and the US.
Mineral products constitute 25% of imports and 18% of exports, mainly driven by the presence of ORLEN Lietuva oil refinery with a refining capacity of 9 million tons a year, owned by Polish concern PKN Orlen.[165] Orlen Lietuva sold over €3.5 billion worth of products outside Lithuania,[165] compared to the total Lithuanian exports of €24 billion in 2014.

Some sectors are directed mainly at export markets. Transport and logistics export two-thirds of their products and/or services; the biotechnology industry exports 80%; plastics export 52%; laser technologies export 86%; metal processing, machinery and electric equipment export 64%; furniture and wood processing export 55%; textile and clothing export 76%; and the food industry exports 36%.[166]

The total value of natural resources in Lithuania is around €17 billion, or around one third of Lithuania's GDP. The most valuable natural resource in the country is subterranean water, which constitutes more than half of the total value of natural resources.

In 1990 Lithuania started petroleum production from onshore oil wells as a response to the Soviet economic blockade.[168][169][170] Since 2001 the yearly production declined as Lithuanian government no longer supports development of new oil wells and banned any development of offshore oil rigs.[171][172]

Timeline of Jewish history in Lithuania and Belarus,"This article presents the timeline of selected events concerning the history of the Jews in Lithuania and Belarus from the fourteenth century when the region was ruled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

While the first mentions of Jews in writing dates back to 1388, it is accepted that Jewish settlement in the region dates back to a century, or possibly centuries, earlier (some claim there were already Jews living in modern-day Belarus by the eighth century).  It has been theorized that Jews immigrated to the grand duchy in different waves, the first from the east (Babylonia, the Byzantine Empire, the Caucasus, and Judea and Samaria) and later from Germany in the west. Others say the region's first Jews were from the Kingdom of Poland, as we know of Polish Jews living in the grand duchy (in what is present-day Belarus) as early as the twelfth century. There are several possible motives that the Jews had to emigrate. In 1323, Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania wrote a letter sent to many cities throughout the Holy Roman Empire saying that despite his country's paganism, Lithuania was tolerant to Christianity, and that he in fact wanted to convert. He then went on to invite ""knights, squires, merchants, doctors, smiths, wheelwrights, cobblers, skinners, millers,"" and others to come live in Lithuania where they could practice their crafts without compromising their religion. This letter likely led to a wave German Jewish immigration to Lithuania. However, it has been theorized that German Jews had already settled in Lithuania centuries earlier, escaping the Crusades in the eleventh-century which massacred communities of Jews.[1]

Russian Jewish historian Abraham Harkavy speculated that the Lithuania's first Jews had emigrated in the tenth century from Khazaria.[2] This idea is based on the story of the Khazar Correspondence which states that the king of Khazaria and thousands of his subject converted to Judaism, transforming the nation into a Jewish kingdom which lasted for centuries, only to be destroyed in the tenth century at the hands of the Byzantine and Kievan Rus' forces in the tenth century.[3] This theory is also in line with the myth that Ashkenazi Jews descend from Khazars.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Jewish_history_in_Lithuania_and_Belarus
Litvaks,"Litvaks (Yiddish: ליטװאַקעס) or Lita'im (Hebrew: לִיטָאִים) are Jews who historically resided in the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (covering present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, the northeastern Suwałki and Białystok regions of Poland, as well as adjacent areas of modern-day Russia and Ukraine). Over 90% of the population was killed during the Holocaust.[2][3][4][5] The term is sometimes used to cover all Haredi Jews who follow an Ashkenazi, non-Hasidic style of life and learning, whatever their ethnic background.[6] The area where Litvaks lived is referred to in Yiddish as ליטע‎ Lite, hence the Hebrew term Lita'im (לִיטָאִים‎).[7]

No other Jew is more closely linked to a specifically Lithuanian city than the Vilna Gaon (in Yiddish, ""the genius of Vilna""), Rabbi Elijah ben Solomon Zalman (1720–1797). He helped make Vilna (modern-day Vilnius) a world center for Talmudic learning.[8] Chaim Grade (1910–1982) was born in Vilna, the city about which he would write.[9]

The inter-war Republic of Lithuania was home to a large and influential Jewish community whose members either fled the country or were murdered when the Holocaust in Lithuania began in 1941. Prior to World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population comprised some 160,000 people, or about 7% of the total population.[10] There were over 110 synagogues and 10 yeshivas in Vilnius alone.[11] Census figures from 2005  recorded 4,007 Jews in Lithuania – 0.12 percent of the country's total population.[12]

Vilna (Vilnius) was occupied by Nazi Germany in June 1941. Within a matter of months, this famous Jewish community had been devastated with over two-thirds of its population killed.[13]

Based on data by Institute of Jewish Policy Research, as of 1 January 2016, the core Jewish population of Lithuania is estimated to be 2,700 (0.09% of the wider population), and the enlarged Jewish population was estimated at 6,500 (0.23% of the wider population). The Lithuanian Jewish population is concentrated in the capital, Vilnius, with smaller population centres including Klaipėda and Kaunas.[14]

The Yiddish adjective ליטוויש Litvish means ""Lithuanian"": the noun for a Lithuanian Jew is Litvak. The term Litvak itself originates from Litwak, a Polish term denoting ""a man from Lithuania"", which however went out of use before the 19th century, having been supplanted in this meaning by Litwin, only to be revived around 1880 in the narrower meaning of ""a Lithuanian Jew"". The ""Lithuania"" meant here is the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Of the main Yiddish dialects in Europe, the Litvishe Yiddish (Lithuanian Yiddish) dialect was spoken by Jews in Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia and northeastern Poland, including Suwałki, Łomża, and Białystok.

However, following the dispute between the Hasidim and the Misnagdim, in which the Lithuanian academies were the heartland of opposition to Hasidism, ""Lithuanian"" came to have the connotation of Misnagdic (non-Hasidic) Judaism generally, and to be used for all Jews who follow the traditions of the great Lithuanian yeshivot, whether or not their ancestors actually came from Lithuania. In modern Israel, Lita'im (Lithuanians) is often used for all Haredi Jews who are not Hasidim (and not Hardalim or Sephardic Haredim). Other expressions used for this purpose are Yeshivishe and Misnagdim. Both the words Litvishe and Lita'im are somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from greater Lithuania and many Litvaks who are not Haredim. The term Misnagdim (""opponents"") on the other hand is somewhat outdated, because the opposition between the two groups has lost much of its relevance. Yeshivishe is also problematic because Hasidim now make use of yeshivot as much as the Litvishe Jews.

The characteristically ""Lithuanian"" approach to Judaism was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual Talmud study. Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to Hasidism. They named themselves ""misnagdim"" (opposers) of the Hasidi. The Lithuanian traditionalists believed Hassidim represented a threat to Halachic observance due to certain Kabbalistic beliefs held by the Hassidim, that, if misinterpreted, could lead one to heresy as per the Frankists.[15] Differences between the groups grew to the extent that in popular perception ""Lithuanian"" and ""misnagged"" became virtually interchangeable terms. However, a sizable minority of Litvaks belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including Chabad, Slonim, Karlin-Stolin, Karlin (Pinsk), Lechovitch, Amdur and Koidanov. With the spread of the Enlightenment, many Litvaks became devotees of the Haskala (Jewish Enlightenment) movement in Eastern Europe pressing for better integration into European society, and today, many leading academics, scientists, and philosophers are of Lithuanian Jewish descent.

The most famous Lithuanian institution of Jewish learning was Volozhin yeshiva, which was the model for most later yeshivas. Twentieth century ""Lithuanian"" yeshivas include Ponevezh, Telshe, Mir, Kelm, and Slabodka, which bear the names of their Lithuanian forebears. American ""offspring"" of the Lithuanian yeshiva movement include Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen (""Chofetz Chaim""), and Beth Medrash Govoha (""Lakewood""), as well as numerous other yeshivas founded by students of Lakewood's founder, Rabbi Aharon Kotler.

In theoretical Talmud study, the leading Lithuanian authorities were Chaim Soloveitchik and the Brisker school; rival approaches were those of the Mir and Telshe yeshivas. In practical halakha, the Lithuanians traditionally followed the Aruch HaShulchan, though today, the ""Lithuanian"" yeshivas prefer the Mishnah Berurah, which is regarded as both more analytic and more accessible.

In the 19th century, the Orthodox Ashkenazi residents of the Holy Land, broadly speaking, were divided into Hasidim and Perushim, who were Litvaks influenced by the Vilna Gaon. For this reason, in modern-day Israeli Haredi parlance the terms Litvak (noun) or Litvisher (adjective), or in Hebrew Litaim, are often used loosely to include any non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Haredi individual or institution. Another reason for this broadening of the term is the fact that many of the leading Israeli Haredi yeshivas (outside the Hasidic camp) are successor bodies to the famous yeshivot of Lithuania, though their present-day members may or may not be descended from Lithuanian Jewry. In reality, both the ethnic make-up and the religious traditions of the misnagged communities are much more diverse.
Customs of Lithuanian non-Hasidic Jews consist of:

Jews began living in Lithuania as early as the 13th century.[citation needed] In 1388, they were granted a charter by Vytautas, under which they formed a class of freemen subject in all criminal cases directly to the jurisdiction of the grand duke and his official representatives, and in petty suits to the jurisdiction of local officials on an equal footing with the lesser nobles (szlachta), boyars, and other free citizens. As a result, the community prospered.

In 1495, they were expelled by Alexander Jagiellon, but allowed to return in 1503. The Lithuanian statute of 1566 placed a number of restrictions on the Jews, and imposed sumptuary laws, including the requirement that they wear distinctive clothing, including yellow caps for men and yellow kerchiefs for women.

The Khmelnytsky Uprising destroyed the existing Lithuanian Jewish institutions. Still, the Jewish population of Lithuania grew from an estimated 120,000 in 1569 to approximately 250,000 in 1792. After the 1793 Second Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Litvaks became subjects of the Russian Empire.

The Jewish Lithuanian population before World War II numbered around 160,000, or about 7% of the total population.[17] At the beginning of the war, some 12,000 Jewish refugees fled into Lithuania from Poland;[18] by 1941 the Jewish population of Lithuania had increased to approximately 250,000, or 10% of the total population.[17]

During the German invasion of June 1941, 141,000 Jews were murdered by the Nazis and Lithuanian collaborators.[19] Notable execution locations were the Paneriai woods (see Ponary massacre) and the Ninth Fort.[20]

Litvaks have an identifiable mode of pronouncing Hebrew and Yiddish; this is often used to determine the boundaries of Lita (area of settlement of Litvaks). Its most characteristic feature is the pronunciation of the vowel holam as [ej] (as against Sephardic [oː], Germanic [au] and Polish [oj]).

In the popular perception,[by whom?] Litvaks were considered to be more intellectual and stoic than their rivals, the Galitzianers, who thought of them as cold fish. They, in turn, disdained Galitzianers as irrational and uneducated. Ira Steingroot's ""Yiddish Knowledge Cards"" devote a card to this ""Ashkenazi version of the Hatfields and McCoys"".[21] This difference is of course connected with the Hasidic/misnaged debate, Hasidism being considered the more emotional and spontaneous form of religious expression. The two groups differed not only in their attitudes and their pronunciation, but also in their cuisine. The Galitzianers were known for rich, heavily sweetened dishes in contrast to the plainer, more savory Litvisher versions, with the boundary known as the Gefilte Fish Line.[22]

The Lithuanian Jewish population may exhibit a genetic founder effect.[23] The utility of these variations has been the subject of debate.[24] One variation, which is implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia, has been dated to the 14th century,[25] corresponding to the establishment of settlements in response to the invitation extended by Gediminas in 1323, which encouraged German Jews to settle in the newly established city of Vilnius. A relatively high rate of early-onset dystonia in the population has also been identified as possibly stemming from the founder effect.[26]

Lithuanian literature,"Lithuanian literature (Lithuanian: lietuvių literatūra) concerns the art of written works created by Lithuanians throughout their history.

A wealth of Lithuanian literature was written in Latin,[2] the main scholarly language in the Middle Ages. The edicts of the Lithuanian King Mindaugas are the prime example of literature of this kind. The Letters of Gediminas are another crucial heritage of the Lithuanian Latin writings.

One of the first Lithuanian authors who wrote in Latin was Nicolaus Hussovianus (about 1480 – after 1533). His poem Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis (A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison), published in 1523, describes the Lithuanian landscape, way of life and customs, touches on existing political problems and reflects the clash of paganism and Christianity.

Joannes Vislicensis (1485–1520) wrote Bellum Prutenum (Prussian war), an epic poem which was dedicated to the Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic order.

A person under the pseudonym Michalo Lituanus [lt] (about 1490 – 1560) wrote a treatise De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum (On the Customs of Tatars, Lithuanians and Muscovites) in the middle of the 16th century, but it was not published until 1615.

Petrus Roysius (about 1505 – 1571), was a lawyer and poet of Spanish birth who became an extraordinary figure in the cultural life of Lithuania in the 16th century. Augustinus Rotundus (about 1520 – 1582) was a publicist, lawyer, and mayor of Vilnius,  who wrote a history of Lithuania in Latin around the year 1560 (no known manuscript has survived). Jonas Radvanas, a humanist poet of the second half of the 16th century, wrote an epic poem imitating the Aeneid of Vergil. His Radivilias, intended as the Lithuanian national epic, was published in Vilnius in 1588.[3]

Laurentius Boierus (about 1561–1619) was a poet of Swedish descent, who graduated from the University of Vilnius. His main work is Carolomachia – a poem dedicated to the victory of Lithuanians over Sweden's army in the Battle of Kircholm in 1605. The poem was written and published in 1606 - just after one year of the event. The poem celebrated Grand Hetman (polemarchos as referred to in the poem) of Lithuania Jan Karol Chodkiewicz and the Lithuanian army. Many interesting battle details were attested in his poem, also one of the first mentionings of the Lithuanian battle cry - muški! (Latin: caede!, English: defeat!)

Matthias Sarbievius (1595–1640) was a poet of Polish birth, graduated from the University of Vilnius and spent most of his productive years in Lithuania - Vilnius and Kražiai. His European fame came from his first collection of poetry, Lyricorum libri tres (Three Books of Lyrics, 1625). In his book Dii gentium (Gods of The Nations,1627) along with Roman deities he described Lithuanian mythology.

Adam Schröter (1525–1572) wrote a poem in Latin devoted to river Nemunas De fluvio Memela Lithuaniae carmen elegiacum (Elegic songs about Lithuanian river Nemunas).[4]

17th-century Lithuanian scholars also wrote in Latin, which was the common scholarly language in Catholic Europe: Kazimieras Kojelavičius-Vijūkas [lt]  and Žygimantas Liauksminas are known for their Latin writings in theology, rhetorics and music. Albertas Kojalavičius-Vijūkas wrote the first printed Lithuanian history in two volumes, Historiae Lituanae (1650, 1669). Kazimieras Kojelavičius-Vijūkas was a prolific writer - his legacy counts more than 20 books in Latin.

Maciej Stryjkowski and Augustinus Rotundus were strong proponents of using Latin as the official language of Grand Duchy of Lithuania because they thought that Lithuanian language was just a vernacular language which had developed from Latin. Their belief was based on grammatical similarities between Lithuanian and Latin.

Universitas lingvarum Litvaniae, written in Latin and published in Vilnius, 1737, is the oldest surviving grammar of the Lithuanian language published in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[5]

Latin books of Lithuanian authors were published in Vilnius, Cracow and Riga. In the 16th century alone, 158 Latin books were published in Vilnius. Research reveals 374 books published in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, or written by citizens of GDL and published abroad, in the 15th-16th centuries.[6] Although the first printing press in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established in Vilnius in 1522, the first Lithuanian who established a printing press was John Lettou in the City of London in 1480.

Lithuanian scholars Abraomas Kulvietis (about 1510 – 1545), Stanislovas Rapolionis (1485–1545) were the very first authors to write in the Lithuanian language. 
Lithuanian literary works in the Lithuanian language were first published in the 16th century. In 1547, Martynas Mažvydas (about 1520–1563) compiled and published the first printed Lithuanian book, The Simple Words of Catechism, which marks the beginning of printed Lithuanian literature. He was followed by Mikalojus Daukša (1527–1613) in Lithuania Propria with his Catechism, or Education Obligatory to Every Christian. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Lithuanian literature was primarily religious. During the Reformation, Catholic and Calvinist supporters in Lithuania competed with each other for influence and education of minds. One example of this - the largest published book in Lithuanian in the 17th century - Calvinist Catechism and collection of psalms Knyga nobažnystės krikščioniškos (The Book of the Christian Piety),[7] patronaged by Jonušas Radvila. During the 18th century, the number of secular publications increased, including dictionaries. The University of Vilnius promoted the usage of the language and the creation of literary works in the first half of the 19th century. But after the partitioning of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, which controlled most of the Lithuanian territory through its empire, in the mid-19th century announced a 40-year ban on the printing in the Lithuanian language in the Latin alphabet. It feared an uprising from Lithuanian nationalists. As a result, publishing was transferred to East Prussia, and Lithuanian books were delivered to Lithuania by book smugglers. The first Lithuanian secular book was a translation of Aesop's fables - Ezopo pasakėčios (Die Fabeln Aesopi), translated from Latin and published in 1706 by Johann Schultz (1648–1710).

The Sermon Book of Wolfenbüttel (Volfenbiūtelio postilė) - the manuscript of the Sermon Book of Wolfenbüttel (1573) is the oldest known Lithuanian handwritten book. The author or authors are unknown. The book was found in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel.

Jonas Bretkūnas (1536–1602) - presumably of Old Prussian descent, a Lutheran pastor, was one of the best-known developers of the written Lithuanian language. He translated the Bible into Lithuanian and was the author of twelve Lithuanian books. His most notable works are Chronicon des Landes Preussen (1578–1579), Postilla, tatai esti trumpas ir prastas išguldimas evangeliu (1591), Kancionalas nekurių giesmių (1589), a manuscript of Lithuanian Bible - Biblia (1590). The Lithuanian language of Bretkūnas is rich and was unmatched till the writings of Kristijonas Donelaitis. It largely influenced the formation of a Lithuanian literary language and writing style.

Konstantinas Sirvydas (1579–1631) religious preacher, lexicographer, published the first volume of a collection of his sermons entitled Punktai Sakymų (Sermons), the purity, style and richness of the Lithuanian language of it are still admired today. His Polish-Latin-Lithuanian dictionary Dictionarium trium linguarum was used up to the 19th century and was highly rated by Lithuanian writers and lexicographers.

Samuelis Boguslavas Chilinskis (1631–1666) a Calvinist, translator of the Bible into Lithuanian. The translation was passed to print in London in 1660, but due to unfavourable circumstances it was not finished - only half of the Old Testament was published. Chilinskis also issued two brochures in which he explained his work to the British society and the necessity to publish the Bible in Lithuanian with short information about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania - An Account of the Translation of the Bible into the Lithuanian Tongue (1659) and Ratio institutae translationis Bibliorum in linguam Lithuanicam, in quam nunquam adhuc Scriptura sacra est versa, ex quo fidem Christianam, ab conjunctionem Magni Ducatus Lithvaniae cum Regno Poloniae (1659). As a main source Chilinskis used then popular Dutch Bible edition Statenbijbel.

Kristijonas Donelaitis (1714–1780) wrote the first Lithuanian poem in hexameter Metai (The Seasons, 1818), thus laying the foundations for Lithuanian poetry. His poem is considered the most successful hexameter text in Lithuanian as yet.

Antanas Strazdas (1760–1833) was a poet, who wrote lyrics influenced by folk songs. His best-known work, the hymn Pulkim ant kelių(Let us Fall on Our Knees) is still sung to this day in churches. His most famous poems include Strazdas (The Thrush), where the poet, personified by the bird, sings about peasant's joys and worries; Aušra (The Dawn) tells about the joy dawn brings and that breaks a lot of rules on rhythm and rhyme; Barnis (The Quarrel) is the only poem about Strazdas himself.

Jurgis Pabrėža (1771–1849) was a priest, physician, and botanist; he wrote an encyclopedic work on botany in Samogitian dialect Taislius auguminis (Botany), created Lithuanian terminology of botany. He also wrote about 250 original sermons and a diary Ryžtai (Determinations).

Simonas Daukantas (1793–1864) promoted a return to Lithuania's pre-Commonwealth traditions, which he depicted as a Golden Age of Lithuania and a renewal of the native culture, based on the Lithuanian language and customs. With those ideas in mind, he wrote already in 1822 a history of Lithuania in Lithuanian - Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių (The Deeds of Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), though still not yet published at that time.

Mikalojus Akelaitis (1829–1887) one of the most prominent creators of and publishers of Lithuanian didactic literature, publicist, ethnographer. He contributed to Auszra (The Dawn), Gazieta Lietuwiszka (The Lithuanian newspaper), composed narratives Kvestorius (1860), Jonas Išmisločius (1860). In a letter to historian Michal Balinski in 1857 he wrote: ""We should lift up the Lithuanian language, wrest away from scorn that language which has the Sanskrit greatness, the Latin force, the Greek  refinement, and the Italian melodiousness.""[8]

Bishop Motiejus Valančius (1801–1875) sponsored the illegal practice of printing Lithuanian books in Lithuania Minor and smuggling them into Lithuania by knygnešiai. He wrote books himself in a rich Samogitian dialect: Palangos Juzė (Juzė from Palanga); the first illustrated book for children in Lithuanian, Vaikų knygelė (Children's book); Žemaičių vyskupystė (Samogitian bishopric). He also urged to resist Russification and to protest against the closing of Catholic churches and monasteries. Valančius was one of the main figures who laid the ground for the Lithuanian National Revival.

Antanas Baranauskas (1835–1902) wrote the poem Anykščių šilelis (The Forest/Pinewood of Anykščiai, a programmatic work whose main aim was to uncover the beauty of the Lithuanian language and to demonstrate its suitability for poetry. The poem Anykščių šilelis is considered the most famous syllabic verse in Lithuanian. Baranauskas was also a mathematician and dialectologist and created many Lithuanian mathematical terms.

Vaclovas Biržiška (1884–1965) in his monumental 3 volume encyclopedic work Aleksandrynas collected biographies, bibliographies and biobibliographies of Lithuanian writers who wrote in Lithuanian, starting in 1475 and ending in 1865. 370 persons are included in Aleksandrynas.

When the ban against printing in the Lithuanian language using the Latin alphabet was lifted in 1904, Lithuanian writers began to experiment with and adopt elements of various European literary movements such as Symbolism, impressionism and expressionism. The first period of Lithuanian independence (1918–40), in the interwar period, gave rise to literature that explored their society and create characters with deep emotions, as their primary concerns were no longer political.
The Keturi vėjai movement began with the publication of Prophet of the Four Winds by the poet Kazys Binkis (1893–1942). This was a rebellion against traditional poetry. The theoretical basis of Keturi vėjai initially was futurism which arrived through Russia from the West; later influences were cubism, dadaism, surrealism, unanimism, and German expressionism.

Maironis (1862–1932) is one of the most famous classical Lithuanian poets. He was noted for both dramatic and lyric romantic poetry and has been called “the poet-prophet of the Lithuanian national revival.” He laid the ground for modern Lithuanian poetry. Maironis' poetry was inspired by the nature and ancient history of Lithuania. The names and deeds of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania are often encountered in his verses. The collection of poems Pavasario balsai (Voices of Spring, 1895) is his most notable work.

An outstanding figure of the early 20th century was Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius (1882–1954), a novelist and dramatist.

Ignas Šeinius (1889–1959), was a novelist, a Lithuanian diplomat to Sweden and other Scandinavian countries and an impressionist writer. His most notable works are the novel Kuprelis (The Humpback, 1913) and Raudonasis tvanas (The Red Flood, 1940), firstly written in Swedish as Den röda floden. Šeinius describes how the Soviets destroyed the country's independence, trampled the Lithuanian nation's patriotism, forcefully introduced the Soviet way of life; how they Sovietized the country's economy and expropriated private business. The Red Flood serves as an eloquent testimony of those terrible events.[9] His science fiction novel Siegfried Immerselbe atsijaunina (Siegfried Immerselbe rejuvenates himself, 1934) was one of the first novels in Europe denouncing national socialist dystopia.

Petras Vaičiūnas (1890–1959) was another popular playwright, producing one play each year during the 1920s and 1930s.

Based on this experience, Sruoga later wrote his best-known work Dievų miškas (Forest of the Gods, 1957). In this book, Sruoga revealed life in a concentration camp through the eyes of a man whose only way to save his life and maintain his dignity was to view everything through a veil of irony and sarcasm. He exposed both torturers and victims as imperfect human beings, far removed from the false ideals of their political leaders. For example, he wrote ""A man is not a machine. He gets tired."", referring to the guards (kapo) beating prisoners.

Most known books of Dalia Grinkevičiūtė are  Lietuviai prie Laptevų jūros (Lithuanians by the Laptev Sea),[23] 1988 ("" Reconciliation"", 2002), A Stolen Youth, a Stolen Homeland: Memoirs, 2002, Shadows on the Tundra, 2018.

Ona Lukauskaitė-Poškienė (1906 – 1983) was a Lithuanian resistant, sentenced to 10 years for her activity in anti-Soviet resistance. She wrote memoirs about her years in Soviet lagers and a novel Lagerių pasakos (Fairy Tales of GULAGs).

The Lithuanian partisan movement, which lasted for more than 8 years, also contributed to folklore as well. There are known thousands of partisan songs (partizanų dainos) which were popular among partisans and the Lithuanian people.

There is a body of work by Lithuanians who were compelled to leave the country or who emigrated as children with their parents. Lithuanian exile literature is an equivalent part of literature created by those who stayed. With the return of the Soviets in 1944, about two-thirds of the Lithuanian writers, along with 62,000 other Lithuanians, went abroad - thus, Lithuanian literature was split in two.[24]   These authors include Antanas Škėma (1910–1961), Alfonsas Nyka-Nyliūnas (1919–2015), Marius Katiliškis (1914–1980), Kazys Bradūnas (1917–2009), Bernardas Brazdžionis (1907–2002), Henrikas Radauskas (1910–1970) and many others.[25]

Numerous Lithuanian poets were forced into exile or emigrated to flee the Soviet occupation after World War II. They wrote expressing nostalgia for the native land and Lithuanian nature, and homesteads. This movement was named Žemininkai, meaning the land poets, after the anthology Žemė (The Land), which was compiled by Kazys Bradūnas and was published in Los Angeles in 1951. Five poets usually classified as Žemininkai are Juozas Kėkštas (1915–1981), Kazys Bradūnas, Alfonsas Nyka-Niliūnas, Henrikas Nagys (1920–1996) and Vytautas Mačernis (1921–1944) (posthumously).

The Lithuanian exile literature has been divided into three periods:  1) the period of the refugee camps in Germany and Austria (1945–50), which was characterized by feelings of alienation, nostalgia, and uncertainty about the future; 2) the period of settlement (1950–60) in which difficulties of adaptation to the unfamiliar and conflict between old and new values were uppermost; and 3) the period of integration into a new, modern society, in which experimentation in literature once more became important.[24]

The most famous novel by Antanas Škėma, Baltoji drobulė (White Shroud, 1958) only recently was translated into English and German and got international acclaim.

Jonas Mekas (1922–2019) is a filmmaker, poet and artist and has often been called ""the godfather of American avant-garde cinema"". He is known for collections of poems Semeniškių idilės (1948), Gėlių kalbėjimas (1961), Dienoraščiai 1970–1982 (1985), essays Laiškai iš niekur (Letters from Nowhere, 1997). The poems and prose of Mekas have been translated into French, German, and English.

Vytautas Kavolis (1930–1996) was a sociologist, literary critic, and cultural historian. His studies on Lithuanian nationalism and literature were influential among Lithuanian intellectuals abroad and after regaining the Independence in 1990 - in Lithuania as well.

Algis Budrys (1931–2008) was born into the family of a Lithuanian diplomat which didn't return to Lithuania after its occupation by the Soviet Union. Algis Budrys wrote in English and is known for such science fiction novels as Who?, Rogue Moon. In addition to numerous Hugo Award and Nebula Award nominations, Budrys won the Science Fiction Research Association's 2007 Pilgrim Award for lifetime contributions to speculative fiction scholarship.

Eduardas Cinzas (1924–1996) left Lithuania in 1944 and settled in Belgium. In his novels, the life of small Belgian cities is depicted realistically and sarcastically. Most notable works - Brolio Mykolo gatvė (The Street of Brother Mykolas, 1972), Šv. Petro šunynas (The Doggery of Saint Peter, 1984)

Antanas Šileika (b. 1953) was born in Canada to Lithuanian parents. Through journalism, he became involved with Lithuania's restitution of independence during the fall of the Soviet Union in 1988–1991, and for this activity, he received the Knight's Cross medal from the Lithuanian government in 2004.[27] His most notable works are Woman in Bronze (2004), The Barefoot Bingo Caller (2017), Provisionally Yours (2019).

In Lithuania, 45 publishing houses cover 83% of the entire book publishing market.[28] Vilnius Book Fair is the biggest Book Fair in the Baltic States. Also, it is one of the most significant cultural events in Lithuania. The International Vilnius Book Fair is exclusively focused on the reader; its main accent is on books and cultural events, as well as on the possibility for authors to interact with their readers.[29] Translation of Lithuanian authors into other languages is supported by the Translation Grant Programme being run by the Lithuanian Culture Institute.[30] Only in 2020 translations of 46 books by Lithuanian authors were confirmed.[31]

Poezijos pavasaris (Poetry Spring) is an international poetry festival, taking place annually, since 1965. It features Lithuanian poets as well as other international poets focusing on a variety of literary forms including poetry, translations and essays.[32] Every year the laureate of the festival is awarded an oak wreath. Since 1985 the international poetry festival Druskininkai Poetic Fall takes place in early October.

Tomas Venclova and Dalia Grinkevičiūtė are the most published and translated Lithuanian authors abroad.

First fragments of literary criticism are found in writings and bookmarks of Danielius Kleinas (1609–1666), Michael Mörlin (1641–1708), Pilypas Ruigys (1675–1749) and others. Simonas Vaišnoras (Varniškis) (1545–1600) was the first who wrote more comprehensively about Lithuanian literature in the preface of his Žemčiūga teologiška (The Pearl of Theology, 1600)[33]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_literature
Lithuanian cuisine,"Lithuanian cuisine features products suited to the cool and moist northern climate of Lithuania: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialties. Various ways of pickling were used to preserve food for winter. Soups are extremely popular, and are widely regarded as the key to good health. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Eastern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with its Baltic neighbors and, in general, northeastern European countries.

Longlasting agricultural and foraging traditions along with a variety of influences during the country's history formed Lithuanian cuisine.[citation needed]

German traditions have had an influence on Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding (kugelis or kugel) and intestines stuffed with mashed potato (vėdarai), as well as the baroque tree cake known as Šakotis. Lithuanian noblemen usually hired French chefs; French cuisine influence came to Lithuania in this way.[1] The most exotic influence is Eastern (Karaite) cuisine, and the dish kibinai which became popular in Lithuania. Lithuanians and other nations that lived in Grand Duchy of Lithuania also share some dishes and beverages. Lithuanian cuisine also influenced Russian and Polish cuisines.[2]

The earliest mentions of food and agriculture of the Baltic people (Aestii) and related customs comes from Tacitus circa 98 AD: ""they cultivate grain and other crops with a perseverance unusual among the indolent Germans.""[3]

The 9th-century traveler Wulfstan attested usage of mead among West Balts: ""There is a great deal of honey and fishing. The king and the most powerful men drink mare's milk, the poor men and the slaves drink mead. ... There is no ale brewed among the Este but there is plenty of mead.""[4]

In the 14th century, Lithuania almost all today known cereals and legume were grown, but rye was the most popular, since it was easier to grow in the Northern European climate and the crop was more predictable. In the hillfort of Maišiagala in the layer of 13–14th century about 20 sorts of various cereals and legumes were found – winter and summer rye, wheat, barley, oat, millet, buckwheat, lentil, vetches, peas, broad beans.[5]

In the Middle Ages, hunting was the main way to provide oneself with meat. It is known that Vytautas The Great before the Battle of Žalgiris organized a big hunting in the Baltvyžis forest and prepared barrels of salt-cured meat for the army. Game was also a staple of noblemen: wisents, aurochs, and deer were hunted. Lithuania had long-lasting wars (about 200 years) with Teutonic Order. It also kept diplomatic relationships with it, during which various presents were exchanged - it is known what Teutonic Order sent a rare wine to Anna, Grand Duchess of Lithuania, wife of Vytautas the Great, in 1416. At this time Lithuanian nobleman already imported saffron, cinnamon, rice, pepper, raisins for their needs.[6] The Congress of Lutsk, hosted by Vytautas the Great, was another example of medieval Lithuanian cuisine. Chronicles report that seven hundred barrels of honey, wine, 700 oxen, 1,400 sheep, hundreds of elk, wild boar, and other dishes were consumed daily.

Traditional Lithuanian hunting and landscape, still existing conflicts between paganism and Christianity was described by Nicolaus Hussovianus in his Latin poem Carmen de statura, feritate ac venatione bisontis (A Song about the Appearance, Savagery and Hunting of the Bison, 1523).

Many culinary innovations came from Italy with Bona Sforza, Grand Duchess consort of Lithuania. Bona Sforza introduced the fork and traditional Italian food – olives, olive oil; made wine and wheat flour more popular. Parsnips, cauliflowers, spinach, and even artichokes were introduced and grown. It is assumed that Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania had their own kitchen garden.
Daughter of Bona Sforza, Catherine Jagiellon after marrying John III of Sweden introduced the fork and other cultural habits to Sweden.[7] Son of Bona Sforza Sigismund II Augustus had an Italian chef Sigismondo Fanelli, living in Vilnius, Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.

The court account books of Alexander Jagiellon mention court officials also associated with the kitchen: the titles Master of the Kitchen was the magnate Petras Aleknaitis, while the actual functions of the kitchen-master were carried by kitchen senior Raclovas, other Kitchen Master is also mentioned – Mikalojus Jundilaitis and the Carver Butrimas Jokūbaitis Nemiraitis. In the 16th century, a water pipe was built from Vingriai springs straight to the kitchen of Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius.[8]

In the sale contract made in 1623 by Elisabeth Sophie von Brandenburg, wife of Jonušas Radvila and Jonušas Kiška, she sold a garden in Vilnius. The text of the treaty has very detailed mentionings of the garden plants such as grafted apple trees, pears, plums (prunus domestica), cherries, wild cherries, vitis, hawthorns, dog roses. A garden for Italian vegetables (as they called back then) is also very detailed. That is potatoes, artichokes, asparagus, lamb's lettuce, rucola, garden cress, spinach, melons, beets, rushes, French parsley, Italian onions, lettuce, chicory. And spices and decorative shrubs: anise, peppermints, estragon, dill, true indigo and junipers. Wooden orangerie is also mentioned which was used to grow fig-trees and common walnuts.[9] In XVI rulers and nobleman of Lithuania consumed grapes, oranges, melons, raspberries, strawberries, cherries, and plums, imported ginger, cinnamon, almonds and pepper.

The growing of potatoes in Lithuania is known from the 17th century, but it became more widespread only in the 18th century.[10]

Archeological finds at the place of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania revealed a lot of information about the food eaten, cutlery and serving of the rulers of Lithuania.[11]

First explorer of the Lithuanian flora, botanist Jurgis Pabrėža described spicery growing in Lithuania.

In 18th-century and 19th-century recipes à la Lithuanienne appeared in the French culinary books. The romantic image of Lithuania was associated with lush forests and game – no wonder the recipes à la Lithuanienne were mostly dishes prepared from moose, bear, or grey partridge. La Cuisine classique by Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard, published in 1856 contained Lithuanian recipes of goose soup and sauce. A culinary book by Alphonse Petit La gastronomie en Russie, published in 1900 included eight Lithuanian recipes.[12][13]

In the twentieth century in interwar Lithuania, many girls attended Amatų mokykla (The Trade School), where young women were trained to prepare various types of dishes and learned various recipes, proper table manners, economy and running the household. These schools led to spreading of similar recipes throughout the country.

During the past years, restaurants in Lithuania emerged which specialize in historic Lithuanian cuisine, culinary heritage and its interpretations.

One of the oldest and most fundamental Lithuanian food products was and is rye bread. Rye bread was eaten every day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bread played an important role in family rituals and agrarian ceremonies.[14]
Traditionally, the centerpiece of Lithuanian cuisine is dark rye bread (ruginė duona) which is used more often than light wheat breads. The archeological finds reveal that bread in the 9th - 14th centuries in Lithuania was very similar to the current rye bread.[15] The dough is usually based on a sourdough starter, and includes some wheat flour to lighten the finished product. Traditionally each home had its own sourdough yeast – raugas, which also had symbolical meaning of the home. Rye bread is often eaten as an open-faced sandwich, buttered or spread with cheese. It is sometimes flavored with caraway, or with some onion. Traditional bread is baked on sweet flag leaves. Bread baking was considered an important ritual.[16] Bread was baked in a special oven for bread - duonkepė krosnis.
Lithuanian proverb says - Be aukso apsieis, be duonos ne (One can manage without gold, but not without bread).

Some varieties of Lithuanian bread contain whole seeds of rye and wheat; this type of bread is referred to as grūdėtoji, i.e. ""seeded"" bread.

The most commonly used vegetable in Lithuanian recipes is the potato; in its simplest forms, it is boiled, baked, or sauteed, often garnished with dill, but a tremendous[citation needed] variety of potato recipes exist. Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.

Cucumbers, dill pickles, radishes and greens are quite popular. Beets (burokai) are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making borscht and side dishes. Cabbage is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for soups, or wrapped around fillings (balandėliai). Tomatoes are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior. Sorrel is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.

Lithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, horseradish (krienai), dill (krapai), caraway seed (kmynai), garlic, coriander, oregano, bay leaf, juniper berries (kadagio uogos), hemp seeds and fruit essences. Vanilla and pepper were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.[citation needed]

Pickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.[citation needed]

Linseed oil was moderately popular.[citation needed]

One of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is still alive.

Mushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the Dzūkija region from Druskininkai to Vilnius; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms are used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:

Baravykas is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried baravykas has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. Voveraitė is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. The most common dish using this mushroom is voveraitė sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. Gudukas, arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as lepšė (Leccinum scabrum), raudonviršis or raudonikis (literally, ""red-topped"") (Leccinum aurantiacum), makavykas (Suillus variegatus), šilbaravykis (Xerocomus badius), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as baravykas.

Wild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. Bilberries (mėlynės) and lingonberries (bruknės) are the two most abundant species of wild berries. Cranberries (spanguolės) are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to Čepkeliai Marsh. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (blynai). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. Wild strawberries (žemuogės) are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.

Apples, plums, and pears, which grow well in Lithuania, are the most commonly used fruit.[citation needed] Because they cannot tolerate frost, tropical fruit such as citrus, bananas and pineapples must be imported, and hence were used less often in the past; however, these fruits are now becoming more typical and are widely consumed. During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews (kompots). Gooseberries (agrastai) and currants (serbentai) are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese, which is considered a dessert, is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of Radvila family chef from the 17th century. Sea buckthorn is used for juice and as a garnish.

The most frequently used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, and duck;[citation needed] for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or dusted with breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel.[citation needed] For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared.[citation needed] The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying, and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. Skilandis is a popular Lithuanian sausage and the original production form has been registered as an EU and UK Traditional Speciality Guaranteed under the name Lietuviškas skilandis.[18] The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania – the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked for four weeks in a special room – kaminas – which was used for cooking. Smoking, curing and other meat preparation techniques differ in Lithuanian regions.

Freshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as pike, zander or perch, are often baked whole or stuffed. Herring is marinated, baked, fried, or served in aspic. Since the 19th century, herring was imported to Lithuania from Norway, Stavanger.[19] Salmon is also a popular dish often served with a cream sauce, vegetables, and rice. Before building dams after Soviet occupation, salmon was quite abundant fish in Lithuanian rivers.

Smoked fish such as eel or bream are popular entrees and appetizers in areas near the Baltic Sea, especially in Neringa.[citation needed]

Crayfish are also popular and are usually eaten in the summertime as a delicacy and a side dish served with beer.[citation needed]

Lithuania is known for quality dairy products. Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; curd cheese (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream are unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads, and so on. The sour cream Žemaitiškas kastinys is registered in the EU and UK as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG).[20]

Lithuanian curd snacks called sūreliai are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk. A Milk road route was created which leads through important objects of milk production in Lithuania.[citation needed]

There is a large variety of milk products—milk, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir, cream, and yogurt. The most traditional are buttermilk and soured milk, which are eaten with boiled potatoes.[citation needed]

The traditional Lithuanian curd cheese Lietuviškas varškės sūris has been registered as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) in the EU and UK.[21] The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Food historians estimate that the curd cheese was known for 4-6 thousands of years.[22]
Lithuanians started fermenting hard cheese around the 16th century in the region of Samogitia. Across Samogitian borders, this cheese was known as Lithuanian cheese.
Historically there were not many varieties of cheese in Lithuania, due to low levels of lactose intolerance.[citation needed] Milk products were usually consumed fresh, or slightly fermented.
Semi-hard cheese Liliputas in 2015 was registered as an EU Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).[23] Hard cheese Džiugas ripens for at least 12 months, is popular among gourmets and being used as to flavour recipes. Džiugas in 2019 was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication. In the interwar period Šėta was famous for its cheese, which was made in sūrinė (cheese house).
Small family farms throughout Lithuania also producing various types of artisan cheeses being sold in eco and farmer markets, restaurants.[citation needed]

Lithuania consists of five regions: Lithuania Minor (Mažoji Lietuva), Samogitia (Žemaitija), Aukštaitija, Suvalkija, Dzūkija.

Lithuania minor was famous for its fish, mainly freshwater – it was smoked, salted, roasted, dried. The best fish-soup, in Lithuania, similar to Bouillabaisse is also prepared in Lithuania Minor. 
Samogitia is known for its abundant varieties of porridge, crayfish, kastinis and a herring-onion soup cibulinė. 
Aukštaitija is known for potato dishes and vėdarai; Northern Aukštaitija is best known as a beer region of Lithuania. 
Suvalkija is known for quality smoked meat produce – variety of woods being used to gain subtle taste, some produce being smoked up to one month. 
Dzūkija, the most forested region is famous for mushrooms, berries, buckwheat dishes such as buckwheat cake (grikinė boba) and boletus soup. Meat curing by smoking is not practiced in Dzûkija. Instead, the salted cuts of meat remain in brine or are hung and air-dried.

Different types of woods were used for smoking the meat - in Samogitia and Aukštaitija alder tree with combination of juniper was used, in Suvalkija - only alder.

A structure of a Lithuanian meal in its full form, usually performed during festivities.

Slices of meat charcuterie, small types of salad, herring will be offered. The meal is usually cold, not warm.
Several types of various cold dishes will be served to choose from. It could be accompanied with some appetizer
such as bitter liquor.

Soup is a very important part of Lithuania cuisine. Although it does not get much attention as the main dish, its purpose is to
be pleasant and revitalizing.

Main dish is served hot. It could be roasted chicken, beef or a type of main dish which the host is the most 
proud to present to the guests. Beer or wine will be offered with the main dish.

Dessert is served after some time after the main dish. It could be some sort of cake or curd with berries or jam.

Coffee or tea could be served along with dessert or separately.

If guests are spending time at the table having interesting conversations digestive or more coffee or tea will be offered.

The meal structure of the day is also influenced by the ancient life in the farm or village. Usual workday was split into three parts - 
the work from the early morning till breakfast (pusryčiai), work before breakfast and dinner (pietūs) and work between dinner and evening meal (vakarienė).[24] Breakfast was considered the most filling meal, dinner was considered a lighter meal and the evening meal was the lightest.
In the summer then the workday was the longest, light meal before breakfast (priešpusryčiai) and the meal before dinner and evening meal - pavakariai was provided. Up to this day Lithuanians eat quite filling breakfast and really light evening meals.

Lithuanian-style cakes (pyragas) are often baked in a rectangular pan and sometimes have an apple, plum, apricot, or other fruit baked in; they are less frequently iced than is customary in the United States. These cakes are cut into squares for serving. Poppy seed is sometimes used as a swirl filling in dessert bread (Poppy seed roll and šimtalapis) and as a flavoring in other pastries.

For special occasions, torte may be prepared; they often consist of 10 to 20 layers, filled with jam and vanilla, chocolate, mocha, or rum buttercreams; they are lavishly decorated. Lithuanian coffeehouses (kavinė) serve a variety of tortes and pastries to attract evening strollers.

Alus (beer) is extremely popular throughout the country, especially again since the restoration of the Independence in 1990. Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic festivities and rituals.[26] Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was Ragutis or Rūgutis. 21 September was known as the festive Alutinis, Koštuvės or Ragautuvės; the first beer was made using the harvest of the running year.[27] Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.

Farmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.[28] Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.[29]

The microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.

Midus is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of mead made from honey. Baltic people were making midus for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller Wulfstan of Hedeby, who visited Prussians.  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.[30]
Oldest recipe of Lithuanian midus was recorded in a book by Olaus Magnus Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus, published in Rome in 1555.[31] Midus was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry. Since 16th century midus started to compete with imported vine, but it was known and was still very popular in Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania.[32]  Today Midus is produced by several companies and is to be found in the majority of liquor shops. Craft mead producing is also becoming popular. Traditional Lithuanian midus Stakliškės, fermented up to 90 days has a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) label.[33]

Fruit and berry wines being made in Lithuania by several companies. Industrial production of fruit and berry wines was started by Balys Karazija in 1926 in Anykščiai. His wines have won international awards in 1938. Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.

Easter and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania. Easter tables being decorated with juniper or sallow twigs.[35]

Currently, Lithuania is affected by modern cuisine trends—fusion, new Nordic, craft beer, and craft food. Restaurant culture and fine dining is most advanced in bigger cities—Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda. Every year, the 30 best Lithuanian restaurants are selected by Gero maisto akademija (""Good Food Academy"").[37]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_cuisine
Lithuanian Crusade,"The Lithuanian Crusade was a series of campaigns by the Teutonic Order and the Livonian Order under the pretext of forcibly Christianizing the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Livonian Order occupied Riga in 1202 and in the 1230s they settled in Chełmno Land, a fief of Poland. They first conquered other neighboring Baltic tribes—Curonians, Semigallians, Latgalians, Selonians, and Old Prussians—in the Livonian Crusade and Prussian Crusade.

The first raid against the Lithuanians and Samogitians was in 1208. From then on, the orders played a key role in Lithuanian politics, but they were not a direct threat until the 1280s. By that time, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was already a centralized state and could mount defenses. For the next century, the order organized annual colonialist reise (raids) into Samogitian and Lithuanian lands, without great success but at immense human cost. Border regions in Samogitia and Suvalkija became sparsely inhabited wilderness due to ethnic cleansing, although the order gained very little territory. The resulting wars between the Teutonic Order and Lithuania were one of the longest conflicts in the history of Europe.

The grand duchy finally converted to Christianity in 1386, when Grand Duke Jogaila accepted baptism from Poland before his wedding to reigning Queen Jadwiga and coronation as king of Poland. However, the baptism did not stop the crusade, as the order publicly challenged the sincerity of the conversion at the papal court. Lithuania and its new ally, Poland, defeated the order in the decisive Battle of Grunwald in 1410, which is often cited as the end of the Lithuanian Crusade and the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The final peace was reached by the Treaty of Melno (1422), ending 225 years of warfare.

Crusaders claimed to wage war to convert non-Christian ""infidels"" to Christianity by force. In the 12th century, St. Bernard of Clairvaux wrote that the killing of pagans was also justified: ""The Christian glories in the death of the pagan, because Christ is glorified.""[1] Only in the 15th century, with the Council of Constance, would that view be contested and a discussion on the rights of pagans begun.[2] Lithuania itself accepted various religions—during the reign of kings Mindaugas and Gediminas, Franciscan and Dominican monasteries had already been established in Lithuania with Lithuanian monks. In his letters to the pope, Gediminas complained that crusaders destroyed Christian churches to have a pretext for war.

The Baltic Crusade started in 1197. The first encounters of militant Christian missionaries with the Lithuanians occurred in 1185, when Saint Meinhard was attacked by the Lithuanians.[3] Lithuanian troops were also supporting the local resistance of Semigallians and Latgalians. The Teutonic Order was given land near Toruń in the 1220s by Konrad I of Masovia, bringing the crusaders closer to Lithuanian lands.[4]: 415  With the arrival of the first Teutonic crusaders, led by Hermann Balk, in Chełmno Land in 1230, the religious traditions of modern-day Estonia and Latvia began to slowly turn towards Catholicism.[5]: 17  There had already been shared religious beliefs between the Germanic and Lithuanian peoples, like the veneration of the god Perkūnas.[6]

In the 1230s, there were military clashes between the Christians and the Lithuanians near the northern borders of  what was then part of Livonia. The Livonian Brothers of the Sword, founded in 1202, began campaigns to expand into the area. Through the Livonian Crusade, they conquered the Terra Mariana that bordered Lithuanian Samogitia, which increased conflicts.[7] Those conflicts reached their apex in 1236 with the Battle of Saule near Šiauliai—the Livonian Brothers of the Sword suffered a disastrous defeat. Only 10% of their army survived and more than 48 of their knights were killed.[8][9]: 181  In light of their defeat and outstanding debts, the order was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Order called the Livonian Order.[10]

The military campaigns of the reformed Livonian Order against Lithuanians were still unsuccessful. Even with support from the Teutonic Order, the Christian Livonians suffered major defeats in the battles of Durbe (1260),[11] Karuse (1270), and Aizkraukle (1279). These losses weakened the Teutonic Order, allowing for the Great Prussian Uprising.[5]: 18 [12] When the converted king of Lithuania, Mindaugas, was assassinated in 1263, the region entered an era of instability.[9]: 181  Lithuanians supported the Prussian uprisings and arranged military raids together with Prussians and Yotvingians. These included the 1264 siege of Vėluva (Wehlau) castle in Sambia during the reign of Treniota and the revenge taken against Poland for the Yotvingians, led by Vaišvilkas and Švarnas.

Only in 1283, after the reconquest of the Prussians, did the Teutonic Order focus its campaigns on the fragile, newly formed Kingdom of Lithuania.[9]: 26

The Teutonic Order initially planned to incorporate all of Lithuania into the Teutonic State, as it had with Prussia, but those plans faced strong Lithuanian resistance.[13] The Teutonic Order's principal objective was to conquer the Lithuanian lowland region, Samogitia, and build fortresses there to solidify their control. Like a wedge, Samogitia separated the territories conquered by the Teutonic Order and those conquered by the Livonian Order. By subjecting Samogitia, the order would be able to unify its administration of both territories.[14] Starting with the reign of Gediminas, Lithuania also began rapidly expanding eastward, conquering Ruthenian lands and gaining more resources for its long-lasting wars.

For the order, the promotion of Christianity had a strong ideological impetus. When the battles around Jerusalem ceased after the Siege of Acre in 1291, Christian religious groups turned their military efforts toward eastern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula, intent on conquest or reconquest.[15]: 117  The Lithuanian rulers vehemently disputed the concept of baptism and regularly carried out raids and conquests on Germanic lands. As a result, the order became focused on suppressing them as a potent, pagan enemy.[9]: 45  However, the Teutonic argument for the conversion of Lithuanian pagans became, by the end, mostly a pretext for expansion.[16]: 21 [17]: 26

Although they had concentrated their efforts toward the unstable principalities of Belarus and Ukraine, the Lithuanians could not ignore the aggression of the Christian crusaders. Nor could they reach any peaceful agreement with the Teutonic Order, which demanded mass baptisms as a condition for peace. From then on, the defense of Samogitia and other vulnerable regions became a priority for the Lithuanians.[5]: 13–14  The prospect of loot from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the State of the Teutonic Order exacerbated the conflict, and the conquests of both sides were often short-lived or haphazard.[18]: 53

In 1283, chronicler Peter of Dusburg noted that the Teutonic Order finalized its conquest of Prussia and of the Yotvingians. Some Yotvingians retreated to Lithuania, and some the crusaders deported to Sambia. The Lithuanian Crusade began in the winter of 1283.[19]

The first target of the Teutons was Bisenė on the western Lithuanian border.[20] Teutonic soldiers commanded by Prussian Landmeister Konrad von Thierberg crossed the frozen Neman River and attacked the Lithuanian fortress in the morning. It fell in the afternoon and was burned to the ground. After the burning of Kolainiai in 1291 and Bisenė in 1316, Junigeda (now called Veliuona) became the westernmost Lithuanian fortress along the river.[21] In 1298, Lithuanian leader Vytenis attacked the Livonian crusaders in Courland, a part of the Archdiocese of Riga.[5]: 29  After initial successes by the crusaders, the two sides fought in the Battle of Turaida after Vytenis forged an alliance with the citizens of Riga, a city ostensibly under the control of the Livonian Order.[22]: 55–59

The conflicts resumed with the coronation of Grand Duke Vytenis of Lithuania in 1303. Vytenis wanted to confront Lithuania's northern and eastern neighbors. He sent 2,000 armed knights to his borders[5]: 23 , while isolated Lithuanian troops raided Prussia. More stable after suppressing the Prussian revolts of 1283, the Teutonic Order sent military units to Semigallia and Skalvia, then under Lithuanian control. Several years of relative calm followed until the Teutonic Order decided to strike at Samogitia.[18]: 52

The Teutonic Knights organized around 20 raids into the region.[23] Vytenis took measures to undermine the influence of local Samogitian nobles, evidenced by an increasing number of traitors and refugees.[24] The Livonian Order consolidated its control over Semigallia, where Lithuanians had garrisons since the Battle of Aizkraukle. In 1313, the Livonian Order captured Dynaburg Castle, which the Lithuanians had controlled since 1281.[25]

To better demarcate and defend its eastern border against the Lithuanian advances, the Teutonic Order took to erecting small fortresses and fortified houses.[26] The garrisons often contained a few knights with more soldiers and squires. The defenders left only to raid Lithuanian lands. The forts were menacing just because of their strategic location. Some of the most imposing were in Neman, Sovetsk, and Mayovka.[18]: 90–91

Vytenis reacted to the movements of the order in 1311 by directing his best cavalry toward Masuria and unreinforced areas of the Prussian border. Despite 4,000 Lithuanian cavalry, they were surprised and expelled by forces led by Landmarschall Heinrich von Plötzke.[18]: 53–54  But the Christian population's general fear of the ""savage pagans"" did not change with the victory, especially not among German colonists in rural areas of the order's territory.[18]: 53–54  Vytenis's last great attack came in October 1315, shortly before his death.[22]: 55

During Gediminas's rule as grand duke of Lithuania, the war intensified on the northern and western borders with the Teutonic Order. Gediminas allied himself with the king of Poland, Władysław I Łokietek, through a series of marriages in 1325–1328.[5]: 34 [27] Poland became more hostile toward the Teutonic Order due to their dispute over the dominion of Pomerania. As a result, Łokietek stipulated an anti-Teutonic defensive military pact with Gediminas in 1330–1331.

In the winter of 1329, King John of Bohemia formed an army to participate in the crusade.[28] Strengthened by this support, the knights of the order were able to capture several important fortresses in Samogitia. Conflicts with the king of Poland and limited contributions from John of Bohemia delayed the conquest of further territories.[28]

Because the conflict between the Teutonic State and Poland had resumed in 1330, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania experienced a respite. The crusaders prevailed against the Polish in Kuyavia in 1331.[5]: 36  In 1336, a large army supported by John of Bohemia and his son-in-law, Henry XIV, crossed the Neman in Samogitia and attacked the castle of Pilėnai.[29] Seeing their defeat, the defenders burned the fortress's goods and killed themselves. Once the fortress was conquered, the Teutonic Knights replaced it with a new fortification they baptized Bayernburg (Raudonpilis) in honor of Henry XIV. They hoped the fort would serve as a foothold for further campaigns into the region.[18]: 100  After the withdrawal of most of the order's army, Bayernburg was stormed and destroyed by Lithuanian troops led by Gediminas in person. According to local tradition, he was shot by an arrow under an oak tree that still exists outside the fortifications. He more likely died in 1341, a year in which the fighting temporarily subsided.[22]: 270 [30]

The conflict intensified again in 1345 after two sons of Gediminas, Algirdas and Kęstutis, assumed power by ousting their brother, Jaunutis, who had been Gediminas's heir.[15]: 75  The two shared control of the territory as a duumvirate: the land to the southeast was controlled by Algirdas and the land to the west (including Samogitia) was administered by Kęstutis.[15]: 75  As a result, Kęstutis led most of the fight against the Teutonic Order, with mixed results. In 1349, Teutonic commander Winrich von Kniprode seized a victory against the Lithuanians in the Battle of Strėva, which was held in an open field.[22]: 243

In 1352, led by von Kniprode, now grand master of the Teutonic Order, the Teutonic State began a period of quiet growth and avoided disagreements with the Kingdom of Poland.[31] In 1358, Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV expressed a desire for peace if the Lithuanian sovereign would accept Christianity.[18]: 144 [9]: 37  Algirdas stipulated the complete withdrawal of the Teutonic Order from the Baltic region, which Charles IV rejected because he needed support from the order.[32] The war only ended in 1361 when a marshal of the order, Henning Schindekopf, and Louis I of Hungary succeeded in capturing Kęstutis.[9]: 183  The poet and herald Peter Suchenwirt wrote a poem to commemorate the capture, when Kęstutis apparently swore an oath to convert to Christianity.[33] Kęstutis successfully escaped from his imprisonment in Malbork Castle in 1362.[9]: 183

That April, a Teutonic army destroyed the Kaunas Castle, which was situated well within the borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[29]: 123  That success marked the beginning of a period of mutual devastation[34] that only ended when both adversaries were significantly weakened. Between 1362 and 1370, the crusaders made 20 ""punitive expeditions"" into Lithuania. (They would complete 52 by 1382.)[29]: 55  In response, Kęstutis and Algirdas gathered military contingents from all of Lithuania, from Russian feudal lords faithful to the grand duchy, and from the Tatars who were disposed to help because they shared a border with the Teutonic State near Königsberg.[35]

By February 1370, conditions were right for the large Battle of Rudau. The Teutonic army seized victory despite their inferior numbers because they were more comfortable in open-field combat.[22]: 243  Through these advancements, the still well-manned Teutonic Order raided the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, and populous Trakai.[5]: 62-63  The Lithuanians retaliated with sporadic raids.

A new phase began in 1377 with the death of Algirdas.[15]: 75  In Lithuania, a power struggle erupted between Algirdas's sons, Kęstutis, and Kęstutis's son Vytautas. Alternating alliances were forged with former opponents to the north and west since the question of Christian conversion had lost energy in the preceding century.

In 1380, with the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės, the Teutonic Order supported Algirdas's heir, Jogaila, against Kęstutis in exchange for various concessions.[36] While Kęstutis remained a prisoner of Jogaila through 1382, Vytautas escaped and fled to his cousin in the Teutonic State, trusting in their help to depose Jogaila and his allies.[15]: 76  There, he converted to Christianity.

This power struggle ended in the summer of 1384, leading to a pause as the Christianization of Lithuania progressed.[5]: 70  Jogaila went to the Polish nobility, the szlachta, to ask to marry Queen Jadwiga of Poland.[15]: 78  Their conversations about the marriage and Jogaila's converting to Christianity created a more stable relationship between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[37] The treaty of the agreement, the Union of Krewo, set the two countries on a path of increasing closeness, eventually leading to the Polish–Lithuanian union.[38] Jogaila was also forced to enter an understanding with his cousin Vytautas to accept Vytautas's claims and return his possessions. Jogaila (now given the name Władysław II Jagiełło) was elected king of Poland after being baptized and marrying Jadwiga in 1386.[15]: 78  Lithuania, the last pagan state in Europe, embraced Christianity.[39]

The Lithuanian nobility were skeptical about assimilating into Polish culture, so Jagiełło had to concede more rights to Vytautas, who wanted to expand east into the Grand Duchy of Moscow and needed more freedom for military action. Vytautas transferred his rights to Samogitia to the Teutonic Order in the Treaty of Salynas of 1398.[9]: 56  The act was also ratified by Jagiełło as king of Poland in 1404.[9]: 56–57

The leaders of the Teutonic Order were skeptical and uncertain about their future in the region after Jogaila accepted the Polish crown and Christianity while maintaining close ties to Lithuania.[16][17] These doubts created ideological and military problems for the order. Lithuanian conversion challenged the order's status as fighting against paganism, which it had heralded so much in the preceding decades. The order argued that the Lithuanian baptisms had been only for political goals and that the majority of Lithuanians held on to their traditional beliefs.[15]: 74  Denying the possibility of mass baptisms, Vytautas and Jagiełło asked Pope Boniface IX to intervene. The Pope's response arrived in 1403, a papal bull forbidding the Teutonic Knights from declaring war on Lithuania.[40]

The Teutonic Order was worried by the response. The Kingdom of Poland, situated to the south, sheltered the monastic state and allowed it to grow throughout the unstable 15th century.[31] After the order's annexation of Pomerania in 1309 and the Polish–Teutonic War of 1326–1332, Polish nobility grew hostile to the order.[41] Their rejection compounded with the enduring hostility of the Lithuanians, creating tension on the order's southern and eastern borders.

The Golden Horde's defeat of Vytautas in the 1399 Battle of the Vorskla River completely changed Lithuanian foreign politics.[citation needed] Before then, the Lithuanians focused on eastward expansion. Now they changed their objectives and again concentrated on Samogitia. Given the local discontent against the Teutonic Order, Vytautas considered resuming hostilities.

Although the papal bull of 1403 ordered concessions to the feudal lords of Lithuanian regions, the order was not charitable.[42] In order-controlled territories, Lithuanian discontent grew due to the ecclesiastical tithes and the restrictive regime imposed by the merchants of the Teutonic State. When it imposed a new round of tributes on the populus, the threat of a popular uprising became concrete.[5]: 85

Carefully timed letters of protest from the people of Samogitia reached the Roman Curia at the same time as those of numerous European courts and guilds of cities in eastern Europe.[5]: 82  Fomented by Grand Duke Vytautas, the first Samogitian uprising seized the region from 1401 to 1404 and ceased when a peace treaty was signed that recognized the crusaders' authority over the region.[15]: 79  In 1409, Vytautas argued for a second insurrection. With open support for rebellion in Teutonic Order territory, Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen called for war.[43]: 35-36  On August 6, 1409, von Jungingen's herald brought a formal challenge from the order to the king of Poland.[43]: 35-36  This signaled the beginning of the Grossen Streythe (Great Quarrel), as the Teutonic Knights called the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War.

The order began by invading Greater Poland and seizing many castles. In the fall of 1409, a brief armistice was negotiated with the mediation of Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia.[44] On July 15, 1410, the combatants met in the historic Battle of Grunwald.[15]: 79 [45] The Teutonic Order was soundly defeated and entered a period of crisis. Despite his advantage after his victory, Polish king Jagiełło did not pursue a decisive, swift coup against the Teutonic Order, which gave the order time to defend their remaining positions.[46]

With the Peace of Thorn of 1411, the Teutonic Order agreed to release Samogitia and make reparations for razed fortifications. The order stopped making incursions against the Lithuanians, who had by then mostly converted to Christianity due to Polish influence. But the order succeeded in negotiating for lighter sanctions overall thanks to the intervention of Sigismund of Luxembourg, the Holy Roman Emperor.[15]: 60 [5]: 98  Some authors[who?] consider the Peace of Thorn the conclusion of the Lithuanian crusades.[5]: 101 [47]

In 1413, the new Teutonic grand master, Heinrich von Plauen, opposed the arbitration of an imperial envoy, Benedikt Makrai, who had assigned the Neman's east riverbank to the Lithuanians.[48] Because of his opposition, he was deposed by Michael Küchmeister von Sternberg. Understanding the fragility of the order at that moment, von Sternberg sought peace with Poland. However, when he also refuted Makrai's decision, the Polish invaded Varmia to begin the Hunger War of 1414. Defeated, the order renounced their claim.[43]: 72  There was an extended period of truce-making and negotiations, which were extremely costly for a Teutonic Order already weakened by wars and reparations.[15]: 81

At the Council of Constance, the order had to justify its military actions.[15]: 81  The situation became so financially precarious for the order that it had to cut military spending, a drastic shift compared to previous centuries.[49] The Lithuanian borders were only stabilized after the brief Gollub War in 1422, with the Treaty of Melno. The demarcations of the treaty would remain unchanged for nearly 500 years and end with the Lithuanian occupation of the Klaipėda region in 1923.[50]

The Teutonic Order was eager to install itself in Samogitia, and the Lithuanians sought to dissuade them, but both failed. Not only did both lack long-term planning, but the Lithuanians also lacked support among the other feudal lords of eastern Europe.[26] Only particularly energetic grand princes, such as Vytenis around 1311, succeeded in uniting the regionally fragmented Lithuanian forces under one banner for attack. Nevertheless, a combined army of regional sub-units remained only nominally united, which made a combined offensive action difficult in the event of a vigorous counterattack. The average number of men fielded by the order ranged from 3,000 to 8,000.[26] Neither party planned campaigns for precise goals,[26][5]: 226  except for the Teutonic campaign of 1336 that ended with the construction of Bayernburg. The Lithuanians tried to create a precise campaign in 1370, but this fell apart after their decisive defeat at Rudau.[26]

The wars were marked by small skirmishes, raids, sieges, and ferocious reprisals aimed at slaughtering farmers.[5]: 226  Both the Lithuanian light cavalry and the armies of the order preferred to raid unprotected settlements before engaging in large-scale battles.[26] The Lithuanian raiders sometimes tortured their captives,[51] and the Teutonic disdain for the Lithuanians was famously exemplified by their ""gift"" of the Grunwald Swords before their disastrous loss at the Battle of Grunwald. Major battles were the exceptions in the conflict. The Teutonic Order undertook around 300 military campaigns between 1305 and 1409. The Lithuanians made only 45 incursions into the Teutonic State.[52]

The oldest historiography around the Lithuanian crusades is divided between German, Lithuanian, and Polish sources and is usually dedicated to recording political events.[53]: 39, 76  Primary source material is difficult to interpret because of biased descriptions each side used of the other to petition for foreign support.[54]: 74  These propagandistic accounts are exemplified in Peter of Dusburg's 14th century writings like the Chronicon terrae Prussiae, which confused historical research on the crusades for centuries.[55]: 290  For similar reasons, many coeval crusading accounts mistakenly refer to the Lithuanians as ""Saracens"".[4]: 415  The order itself described the Lithuanians as ""heathens"", but French- or English-speaking crusaders often used the term even after the Lithuanians had mostly converted to Christianity.[4]: 415, 419  This probably contributed to the crusaders' confusion and served as a justification to continue crusades.[4]: 425

In Germany, the conflicts were largely forgotten or limited to the dispute between the Teutonic Order and the Kingdom of Poland that ended with the Peace of Thorn. Annalists like Wigand of Marburg often combined facts and oral recounts with folklore and myths.[53]: 43  In the 18th century, Prussian scholars questioned the sincerity of Gediminas's diplomatic efforts and implied promises of conversion.[54]: 76  In history books printed from the 1800s on, the Lithuanian crusade was minimized or recounted in single favorable episodes, such as the Battle of Rudau or the construction of settlements by German colonists.[11]: 60

The conflict is represented in the opposite way in Lithuania today.[22]: 229  Through the Middle Ages, Lithuanian historians like Jan Długosz based their work on the Lithuanian Chronicles. The chronicles comprise combinations of documents (known as redactions) that reflect official state interpretations of Lithuanian history.[53]: 49  The chronicles made arguments for Lithuanian nationalism by connecting the Lithuanian Palemonids dynasty to the rule of Ancient Rome. The historiographic record also includes the personal letters of the Lithuanian rulers Gediminas, Algirdas, and Vytautas, which were often written in Old Church Slavonic, German, or Greek.[53]: 59  These political accounts are supplemented by cultural records like those of Michalo Lituanus and Simonas Daukantas.[53]: 81  Samogitian writers have exalted local deeds of heroism because the region was the central Teutonic aim in the crusades.[56] Poland, present throughout the conflict, is not often mentioned, although Stanisław Sarnicki's chronicle includes discussion of the crusades.[53]: 68

Modern Lithuanian historical research was heavily influenced by Soviet culture and strictures until only recently. A well-regarded Lithuanian study by Edvardas Gudavičius, ""Kryžiaus karai Pabaltijyje"", was written to avoid Soviet censorship, leading Gudavičius to downplay Lithuanian independence and overstate the role of medieval popes in directing the Lithuanian crusades.[55]: 293  Similarly, Soviet historians often held that the Lithuanian coat of arms and governmental structure were all borrowed from Russian culture.[55]: 300  Gudavičius later proposed that the shared rule of Algirdas and Kęstutis should be seen as part of a Lithuanian tradition of ""submonarchs"" with Algirdas leading, rather than the historical belief that the two brothers ruled as equals.[55]: 294  Soviet researchers avoided writing about Algirdas.[55]: 301  The 1986 theory of Gudavičius's student Alvydas Nikžentaitis, that Gediminas was poisoned, challenged the accepted Soviet view of Lithuanian history. Perception of Lithuanian military strategy has changed as well, as historians discovered that the Lithuanians did occasionally use cavalry and make intentional tactical retreats to confuse their enemies, as they did at the Battle of Grunwald.[55]: 296, 300

Medievalist study of the Lithuanian crusades has been limited in English but increased with the fall of the Iron Curtain.[55]: 289  The 1993 research of S. C. Rowell in Lithuania Ascending made it easy for other historians to examine the political and cultural context of the Lithuanian crusades.[55]: 289–290  Rowell argues for the adoption of 16th century Russian sources which, though corrupted, contain information about the Lithuanian crusades.[55]: 290  These newer sources see the uses of religious conversion by Lithuanian rulers like Gediminas as a strategy for gaining political clout and conducting diplomacy; they do not describe the conversions as deceitful.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Crusade
History of Lithuanians in Baltimore,"The history of Lithuanians in Baltimore dates back to the mid-19th century. Thousands of Lithuanians immigrated to Baltimore between the 1880s and 1920s. The Lithuanian American community was mainly centered in what is now the Hollins–Roundhouse Historic District. Baltimore's Lithuanian community has founded several institutions to preserve the Lithuanian heritage of the city, including a Roman Catholic parish, a cultural festival, a dance hall, and a yeshiva.

In 1920, 2,554 foreign-born White people in Baltimore spoke either the Lithuanian language or the Latvian language.[1]

In 1940, 2,839 immigrants from Lithuania lived in Baltimore. These immigrants comprised 4.7% of the city's foreign-born white population.[2]

In the 1960 United States census, Lithuanian-Americans comprised 44% of the foreign-born population in South Baltimore's tract 22–2.[3]

By 1991, there were an estimated 20,000 Lithuanians living in the Baltimore area.[4]

The Lithuanian community in the Baltimore metropolitan area numbered 11,024 as of 2000, making up 0.4% of the area's population.[5] In the same year Baltimore city's Lithuanian population was 1,519, 0.2% of the city's population.[6]

In 2013, an estimated 1,092 Lithuanian-Americans resided in Baltimore city, 0.2% of the population.[7] As of September 2014, immigrants from Lithuania were the 102nd largest foreign-born population in Baltimore.[8]

Lithuanians began to settle in Baltimore in 1876.[9] The wave increased greatly during the 1880s[10] and continued in large numbers until the 1920s. By 1950, the Lithuanian community numbered around 9,000.[9] These Lithuanians settled primarily in a neighborhood north of Hollins Street that became known as Baltimore's Little Lithuania.[11][12][13]

In 1889, Jonas Šliūpas founded the Lithuanian Scientific Society in Baltimore. It promoted Lithuanian language and culture and was active until 1896.[14]

Three Roman Catholic churches have been designated as Lithuanian parishes: St. Alphonsus' beginning in 1917, St. John the Baptist Church from 1888 to 1917,  and St. Wenceslaus beginning in 1872. St. Alphonsus' is the only remaining Lithuanian parish in Baltimore, as St. Wenceslaus was re-designated as a Bohemian parish and St. John the Baptist Church closed in 1989.[15]

While most Lithuanians who settled in Baltimore were Roman Catholic, a large minority were Lithuanian Jews. Between the 1880s and the 1920s, Lithuanian Jews (also known as Litvaks) were a major component of Jewish immigration to Baltimore.[16] The Yeshivas Ner Yisroel, a prominent yeshiva in Baltimore, was founded as a Lithuanian (Litvish)-style Talmudic college by Jews from Lithuania and Belarus. Litvaks also helped found the B'nai Israel Synagogue.[16]

From the 1880s to the 1920s, the Hollins-Roundhouse neighborhood became established as the center of Baltimore's Lithuanian immigrant community.[11] Because of the large Lithuanian population in the area north of Hollins Street, the area became known as Little Lithuania. A few remnants of the neighborhood's Lithuanian heritage still remain, such as Lithuanian Hall located on Hollins Street.[17]

While other immigrant ethnic groups in Baltimore founded numerous ethnic building and loan associations between the 1860s and the 1910s, Lithuanians only founded one. This is because many Lithuanians shared the associations of other ethnic groups, especially those of the Polish.[18]

An annual Lithuanian Festival is held in Catonsville in Baltimore County, not far outside city limits.[19] The festival features Lithuanian food and drink, dances, and ethnic items.[20]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Lithuanians_in_Baltimore
Swedish Lithuania,"Swedish Lithuania, officially known as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Swedish: Storfurstendömet Litauen, Latin: Magnus Ducatus Lituaniæ), was a dominium directum protectorate of the Swedish Empire under the rule of King Charles X Gustav in accordance with the Union of Kėdainiai. It de jure existed from 1655 until 1657[1] when it was terminated and fully reincorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

In 1654, the Tsardom of Russia launched its invasion against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which resulted in huge swathes of the territory falling into the hands of the Russian army. Noting the weak military performance of the Commonwealth, the Swedish Empire sought to take advantage of the political turmoil and occupy parts of the Polish–Lithuanian state: Sweden wanted to make Lithuania a permanent part of its imperial domain as the territory was strategically important in securing the Baltic Sea from Russia. In the summer of 1655, the Swedish army invaded Western Poland and began threatening to do the same to Lithuania. After learning about King John II Casimir fleeing the country, Lithuanian magnate Janusz Radziwiłł and other members of the Lithuanian nobility began considering negotiations with Sweden.[2][3] This decision was also influenced by separatist religious motives as it was strongly supported by the Lithuanian Protestant elite.[4] After Sweden's occupation of northwestern Lithuania, commander Zygmunt Przyjemski informed King Charles X Gustav that Poland is willing to formally cede Lithuania to Sweden in exchange for peace — this proposal was rejected.[5]

On 17 August 1655, the Treaty of Kėdainiai was signed by Jonušas Radvila and other 400 pro-Swedish signatories.[6][7] The treaty laid out certain conditions — the Lithuanian nobility wanted Sweden to protect Lithuania from Moscow, guarantee the country's neutrality in the conflict, political and religious freedoms.[2] These conditions were rejected as they also vaguely mentioned Lithuania having the right to leave Sweden. The Swedish also avoided directly participating in the conflict with the Tsardom of Russia because, in reality, they didn’t have enough manpower in Swedish Livonia to properly assist Lithuania in case of need. Despite this, Sweden promised Lithuania that it would help them in reclaiming their lost territory.[2]

On 20 October 1655, over 1,000 nobles, mostly from Samogitia, gathered at the Kėdainiai Manor, signed the Union of Kėdainiai on behalf of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, dissolved the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and solemnly declared the establishment of a personal union with the Swedish Empire.[2][8] The Swedish side was represented by Lord High Treasurer Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie and Governor Bengt Skytte, with the latter also holding the position of viceroy.[3][9] King of Sweden Charles X Gustav became Grand Duke of Lithuania.[1] Following this, another act was signed by which the Lithuanian nobility pledged its loyalty to the Swedish Crown.[2] On 23 October 1655, the Lithuanian Advisory Council was inaugurated.[1] Swedish Lithuania was set up as a dominicum directum with Jonušas Radvila being promised exceptional rights to certain estates.[2] It is known that both Jonušas and Boguslavas Radvila (Bogusław Radziwiłł) initially wanted to acquire the Lithuanian territories of Minsk, Navahrudak, Brest Voivodeships and Volkovysk, Grodno Counties, as well as the Polish Podlaskie Voivodeship. Meanwhile, ethnic Lithuania was supposed to remain under the direct rule of Sweden.[7] Jonušas Radvila also hoped to become an uncrowned ruler of the entire Swedish protectorate, but his endeavour was unsuccessful.[10]

Seeking to improve Sweden’s reputation among the Lithuanian peasantry and secure a greater political advantage over the Lithuanian nobility, Gabriel De la Gardie was entrusted with assuring them the abolition of serfdom. However, this ultimately did not help to improve their relations with the peasantry as they were left with the burden of supplying significant resources to the Swedish forces and their military effort.[11]  The Swedish administration began confiscating estates from nobles who did not recognise their authority and set the tax rate to 110 000 thaler — many who refused or were unable to pay them were killed, arrested or deported to Sweden with their property being destroyed.[12] The Swedish troops were relocated in the country, with Šiauliai serving as the chief military headquarters and garrisons being stationed across Lithuania proper, including several regiments in Skirsnemunė.[13] For military purposes, Swedish cartographer Georg von Schwengeln and field marshal Erik Dahlbergh have produced a detailed map of the Kaunas region and southern Samogitia.[14]

As time passed, some layers of society, namely the minor nobility and peasantry, began to withdraw their support for Swedish rule. This was mostly a consequence of the Swedish administration introducing heavy taxation and its inability to control the brutality of its own army in the region. In the spring of 1656,[15] certain segments of nobility in Lithuania began revolting against the Swedish, which was followed by the Polish decisive victory against the Swedish Empire in the Battle of Prostki. In 1657, the remaining Swedish troops stationed in the Biržai Castle were ousted and Swedish Lithuania disintegrated. Following this, Boguslavas Radvila, who had served as the acting Grand Hetman of Lithuania and the commander of Swedish forces against Poland, faced trial and was exiled to Königsberg.[16]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Lithuania

Lithuania national football team,"The Lithuania national football team (Lithuanian: Lietuvos nacionalinė futbolo rinktinė) represents Lithuania in men's international football, and is controlled by the Lithuanian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Lithuania. They played their first match in 1923. In 1940, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union; the country regained its independence in 1990 and played their first match thereafter against Georgia on 27 May of that year.

Although Lithuania has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, nor the UEFA European Championship, they have successfully participated in the regional Baltic Cup tournament, which takes place every two years between Lithuania and their Baltic rivals, Latvia and Estonia. Lithuania has won the Baltic Cup championship 10 times out of 29 appearances, and only Latvia has won it more frequently. Despite this Lithuania holds the record for winning the most consecutive Baltic Cup championships, four titles in a row from 1996 to 2000.

From 2012 until 2022, the national team played their home matches at the LFF Stadium in Vilnius.

From 2022, the national team plays their home matches at the Darius and Girėnas Stadium in Kaunas.

On 24 June 1923, Lithuania played their first ever game, at the Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimosi Sąjunga Stadionas, resulting in a 5–0 loss against Estonia. In 1924, Lithuania entered the 1924 Olympics in France, losing 9–0 against Switzerland on 25 May 1924. Two days later, Lithuania suffered a 10–0 loss to Egypt, a record defeat to date. During the early years of the Lithuanian national team, Lithuania regularly played Baltic neighbours Estonia and Latvia, with Lithuania's first win coming in a 2–1 away win against Estonia on 24 August 1924 in Tallinn. In 1930, Lithuania won the third edition of the Baltic Cup in Kaunas.[3] On 13 October 1940, Lithuania played their final game for just shy of 50 years, a 4–3 win against Latvia, following the first Soviet annexation of the country.[4]

Lithuania's first game following the declaration of independence in 1990 was a 2–2 draw against Georgia in Tbilisi on 27 May 1990.[5] In the 1990s, Lithuania established a respectable presence in the World Cup and European Championship qualifiers: third place in their group in both Euro 1996 and the 1998 World Cup qualifiers. In the Euro 2004 qualifiers, they were once again contenders for qualification and managed an away draw with Germany and a home win over Scotland; however, a 1–0 defeat to Scotland in the final game ended their hopes. Although finishing fifth in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group, Lithuania were nevertheless competitive.

Lithuania drew with world champions Italy 1–1 in Naples in a Euro 2008 qualifying game on 2 September 2006, in the first competitive game that Italy played since the World Cup final.

On 6 September 2008, Lithuania defeated Romania 3–0 in a 2010 World Cup qualifier. The victory was regarded by many as ""a historic win.""[6] It was followed by another successful 2–0 performance against Austria in Marijampolė on 10 September 2008.

The following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.

The following players have been called up for the team in the last twelve months.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania_national_football_team
Lithuanians (tribe),"The Lithuanians  or Eastern Old Lithuanians (Latin: Letwini;[1] Low German: Lettowen;[2] Old East Slavic: Литъва, Литва;[3][a] Old Swedish: lättugha;[4] modern Lithuanian: rytiniai senlietuviai, senlietuviai) were one of the largest East Baltic tribes, inhabiting present-day Eastern Lithuania in the 5th–13th centuries.[5] Following the Northern Crusades, the ancient Lithuanians began gradually assimilating other neighbouring Baltic tribes, becoming the primary progenitor group of modern Lithuanians.

It is believed that ancient Lithuania covered around 80,000 km2 and was home to around 300,000 inhabitants, most of them living as farmers.[6] Traditionally historians divide the area into six attested lands – Nalšia, Deltuva, Upytė, Lietuva, Neris and Deremela,[b] with Lietuva (Lethowia)[1] passing on its name to the entire country. There was a seventh land laying in between Neris, Merkinė and Neman rivers but no records of its name remain.[7] Ancient Lithuania stretched from the middle reaches of Neman to the Southeast of Šventoji.

Because of the three archaeological cultures in Lithuania, some scholars divide the Lithuanian ethnos into three cultural groups – Samogitians (Western), Aukštaitians[c] (Central) and Lithuanians (Eastern). Traditionally, the Samogitian tribe is included within the broader Lithuanian ethnos as suggested by historical accounts, dividing Lithuania into two parts – Austechia (Aukštaitija) and Samogitia (Žemaitija)[8][9] – but their origins are a subject of ongoing debates. Linguist Jūratė Sofija Laučiūtė argues that prior to their assimilation, ancient Samogitians were a different tribe from the Lithuanians, which is evinced by certain linguistic features not explainable by phonetics alone, such as the ending -ou <*-ou of masculine nouns in genitive form (e.g. Samogitian velkou, Lithuanian vilkui, meaning (DAT) 'wolf'). Valdemaras Šimėnas suggests that both culturally and linguistically ancient Samogitians were closer to Curonians, Semigallians and Selonians than Lithuanians.[10] In the late 12th century, Samogitians and Lithuanians formed a tribal union, which was the basis for the future Lithuanian state.[11]

Lithuania proper consisted of two archaeological cultural areas – Central and Eastern – with the former never becoming a continuous ethnopolitical unit.[12] Though contested, based on the spread of cremation and West Baltic acculturation, it is believed that the Aukštaitians were a consequence of westward Lithuanian migration into a Samogitian heterogenous cultural zone, driven by Slavic expansion.[13][14] Central Lithuanian culture existed in the 6th–12th centuries, reaching its prosperity in the 9th–11th centuries. Burial practices and ceramics indicate that Central Lithuania was affected by the West Baltic cultures and belonged to the zone of maritime influence. Recent archeological research reveal that Vikings navigated the Neman River, engaging in trade with the local populations, whereas Kaunas emerged as a significant economic and political trading centre.[15] Lithuanians were familiar with surrounding waterways around the Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon, initially possessing fluvial watercraft. Their first maritime vessels were likely oar-powered and equipped with a single sail, which were subsequently replaced by cogs.[16] By the early 13th century, Lithuanian ships ventured into the Baltic Sea and reached the shores of Gotland where they would trade goods such as amber, honey, beeswax, flax, hemp or ash – it lasted until 1229 when Pope Gregory IX restricted the rights of traders and banned the practice of selling goods to the heathens.[17] In the 12th–13th centuries, Eastern Lithuania witnessed notable social and economic development, fostering advancements in trade, artisantry and political stability. In contrast, the western Baltic regions experienced a decline, as indicated by the substantially greater number of archaeological monetary finds in Eastern Lithuania.[18] From the 13th century, as trade relations advanced, ancient Lithuanians began using their own currency – long silver ingots with cut marks – known as ilgasis.[19]

Archaeologist Laurynas Kurila believes that by the 5th century, the Lithuanians began adopting a war-based societal model found in military democracies.[20] The tribal society was governed following the customary law and was based on a hierarchical structure consisting of four divisions – a duke, soldiers, free peasants (laukininkai) and slaves (šeimynykščiai). By the 9th century, a chieftain gradually became known as kunigas. Commencing in the 12th century, each ruler began to govern a particular land through hereditary succession and adopting the title kunigaikštis.[21]

In ancient Lithuanian culture, religious suicide was practised and likely common. The Lithuanians were known to engage in acts of honour suicide by sacrificing themselves to their gods or after defeat in battle.[22] In addition, Lithuanian women would take their own lives following the loss of their husbands. The latter custom was attested by Henry of Latvia when 50 Lithuanian wives of the defeated warriors chose to hang themselves to reunite with them in the afterlife.[23] In a letter from Pope Honorius III written in 1218, it is said that the Lithuanians practice human sacrifice of war captives to their gods.[24]

The deceased tribespeople were buried in the ground and by the 7th–8th centuries, cremation became widespread throughout the area.[25] They were positioned with men's heads facing West and women's heads facing East.[26] The Lithuanians dedicated separate burial mounds to the riding horses, sometimes half of an entire kurgan.[27]  The Lithuanians had the custom of purposely breaking weapons as well as jewellery when burning the deceased – this was probably done to send these items to the afterlife. They also produced small axes only used during funeral rites.[28]

Lithuanian soldiers were equipped with stabbing spears with socketed spearheads, throwing spears with hafted spearheads as well as shields as early as the 5th century. Both types of spears have been in use until the 9th century whereas the most recent shields date to the 8th century.[29] From the late 5th century, the Lithuanians also possessed ornamented battle axes and, as of the 10th century, they began crafting light, usually adorned, broad-bladed battle axes.[30] The findings in Varliškis and Čiobiškis burial mounds suggest that axes with narrow blades and blunt ends were also used as weapons until the 10th–11th century.[31] Both one-edged and two-edged swords are rarely found as they were probably expensive to produce and only wealthy chieftains could obtain them.[32] Around the 11th–12th century, the first chainmail armour started to appear.[33]

The Lithuanians were known as fierce warriors who constantly raided neighbouring lands, predominantly in Northeastern Europe,[34] seeking to capture people, cattle and horses.[35] Kievan Rus’ chronicles attest that the Lithuanians were defeated by Yaroslav the Wise and paid Kievan Rus’ tribute. Nonetheless, it remains unclear when exactly the said battle happened: both the Russian Primary Chronicle and The Chronicle of Novgorod mention one attack against the Lithuanians, with the first record claiming it took place in 1040 and the second one stating it happened in 1044.[36] Birchbark manuscript 590 mentions a Lithuanian military campaign against Karelia in c. 1060–80.[37] In the 11th century, the Lithuanians were recorded crossing the Orsha River and devastating surrounding locations.[38]

In 1131, Mstislav I of Kiev launched a campaign against Lithuania, but when the Kievans were heading back, the Lithuanians retaliated by annihilating one of their detachments.[39] By 1158, Lithuania was acting as a sovereign early feudal proto-state.[40] From the late 12th century, their number of military campaigns spiked. In 1183, The Chronicle of Novgorod mentions a Lithuanian attack on Pskov, marking the start of numerous raids against them.[41] A record from The Tale of Igor’s Campaign compares the devastating impact of the Lithuanian incursions to that of the Polovtsians.[42] Further incursions in 1185–86 led to Lithuanians taking many Livonian captives,[43] prompting the Livs to seek protection from Bishop Meinhard.[44] In 1187, their forces targeted the vicinity of Polotsk, resulting in the death of Iziaslav.[45] In 1188, the Lithuanians made an alliance with the Swedes against Novgorod.[46] Their plundering continued as they raided Karelia in 1191[47] as well as the countryside of Velikiye Luki in 1198.[34] Russa, a Novgorodian town south of Lake Ilmen, was likely fortified the following year in response to these raidings.[48]

In 1200, the Lithuanians devastated the lands near Lovat doing ""whatever they pleased"".[34] In 1201–02, they started a war raid against Semigallia, yet their plans were disrupted by an attack of the Principality of Polotsk on Lithuania itself.[42] In 1203, they allied with the Principality of Jersika and stormed Riga, taking the livestock of its residents.[49] In 1205, a band of 2,000 Lithuanians led by Žvelgaitis[50] marched into Estonia and returned with ""countless captives [possibly more than 1,000 Estonians] and an ineffable number of cattle and horses.""[51]  However, their victorious return with booty and prisoners of war was marred by an ambush of the allied Semigallian and German forces.[52][53] On Christmas Day of 1207, they stormed Treiden (Turaida), Livonia and looted the countryside, including the house of a priest.[53][54] The raiders also took prisoners most of whom were women and children.[35] In 1208, Semigallians and Germans invaded Lithuania, only to find its villages abandoned. On their way back home, the enemy was then attacked by Lithuanian raiders who defeated them and took many captives.[55] In 1209, Henry of Latvia described the Lithuanians as ruthless people whose neighbours live in constant fear and endure their relentless raids:

At that time, the Lithuanians so dominated over all the tribes living in these [neighbouring] lands, be they Christians or heathens, that few dared to live in their villages, especially the Latgalians who dared the least. Leaving their homes deserted, they always sought hideouts in the dark woods, but even so, they could not escape them because [the Lithuanians], constantly lurking in the forests, would capture and kill them, take others as captives, bring them to their land, and strip them of all their belongings. And Ruthenians fled through the woods and villages from the Lithuanians, even if they were few, as hares flee from a hunter, and the Livs and the Latgalians became food and fodder for the Lithuanians as sheep without a shepherd, trapped among a pack of wolves.[56]

The frequency of certain raids in the 1210s is likely related to the connections shared by the Lithuanians and Estonians who at times might have collaborated with one another – during a Novgorodian invasion of an Estonian vicinity, the Lithuanians invaded Novgorod.[57] In 1212, ancient Lithuanians returned to Estonia again and pillaged Sakala.[58] The following year, they raided Lennewarden (Lielvārde)[59] and burned down Pskov.[60] In 1219, Ösel (Saaremaa) faced a brutal onslaught by 1,500 Lithuanian raiders who landed in Sõrve,[61] ravaged the island and killed its locals:

Deluded by their bravery / They went through all the land [...] / All paths, and also tracks / Were covered rich in blood [...] / They taught folk how to die / Both men and women / If only they have failed to flee.[62]

Frequent campaigns on Novgorod by the Lithuanians in 1217, 1218, 1223, 1224, 1226, 1230 and 1234 severely weakened Novgorodians as they struggled to mount effective defences or swift counterattacks.[63] The increased focus on the Rus’ principalities was also facilitated by making a truce with Riga in 1226, after which 7,000 Lithuanian soldiers sacked Torzhok and Toropets.[64] From the 1230s, following the conquest of other neighbouring tribes, the Christian military orders in both the North and Southwest began posing an existential threat to the Lithuanians. As of 1231, the Danish Census Book mentions Lithuania (Littonia) as well as many other Baltic lands paying tribute to the Danes who ultimately did not succeed in subjugating them.[65] In late 1244, the Curonians, Samogitians and Lithuanians stormed Amboten Castle (Embūte), which the Livonian Order had taken over the previous year.[66] The Novgorod Fourth Chronicle mentions that the Lithuanians killed Mikhail Khorobrit during the Battle of Protva in 1248.[67]

In July 1251, with Mindaugas securing a crown from the pope, Lithuania was granted the status of a Catholic kingdom. Nonetheless, the period of peace between Lithuania and the Crusader states was short-lived. In 1258–59, despite withstanding a devastating Mongolian incursion, Lithuania was in political turmoil with its pro-pagan noblemen pushing for a renouncement of their alliance with the Livonian Order and securing favourable relations with the Tatars instead.[68]

In 1263, the Lithuanians sacked Pernau (Pärnu) and burned down its newly built Osilian-Maritimian cathedral city, Perona.[69] Unhindered, they marched further north and attacked Wiek (Läänemaa) as the Livonian knights who were protecting this land were sent away to Courland.[70] In 1270, the Battle of Karuse on frozen ice near the island of Mohn (Muhu) ensued: after returning from a raid campaign, the Lithuanians were unexpectedly attacked by the Livonian Brothers. However, they came out victorious against the knights, killing Master Otto of Luttenberg.[71] According to Peter of Dusburg, Knight Commander of Ragnit Ludwig of Liebenzell sailed to Aukštaitija and ""took part in many laudable battles in many campaigns at sea"" against the Lithuanians from 1294 to 1300.[72] In 1295, Teutonic Knights sailed the Neman River, pillaging a nearby Lithuanian village and taking captives on the way, but were then attacked by Lithuanian boats. Despite Lithuanians suffering the loss of 70 warriors, the Crusaders were ultimately defeated, with approximately 30 casualties, including that of Friar Dietrich of Esbek. In the same year, the Lithuanians sailed to the Neman island near Ragnit (Neman), preying on horses and cattle.[73] In 1296–97, they stormed German-colonised Culm (Chełmno) and sacked five villages near Golub Castle, capturing or slaughtering many Christians.[74]

Throughout the Northern Crusades, the majority of Baltic tribes suffered tremendous casualties in conflicts and revolts against their conquerors. The Lithuanians, who succeeded in establishing a state, gradually assimilated those residing in its territories. The migration of Baltic peoples who resisted German colonisation and sought refuge in Lithuania also contributed to the ongoing ethnogenesis. Historical records attest that after the destruction of Sidabrė Castle in 1290, 10,000 Semigallians fled to Lithuania.[75] Old Prussians met a similar fate with many seeking sanctuary in southern Lithuania after the unsuccessful Prussian uprisings.[76] Following the demise of Curonian and Prussian tribal societies, which acted as the primary Baltic cultural centre for 3,000 years, Lithuania emerged as their successor.[77]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanians_(tribe)
Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,"Hetmans of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Lithuanian: etmonas) were the highest-ranking military officers, second only to the King, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The first Polish title of Grand Crown Hetman was created in 1505. The title of hetman was given to the leader of the Polish Army and until 1581 it was awarded only for a specific campaign or war. Later it became a permanent title, as did all the titles in the Kingdom of Poland and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It could not be revoked unless treachery had been proven (from 1585). Hetmans were not paid for their services by the Royal Treasury.

From the end of 16th century there were two hetmans in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and two hetmans in the Crown: a Field Hetman and a Great Hetman (sometimes translated as Grand Hetman). As a result, there were in total four hetman titles: Great Crown Hetman, Field Crown Hetman, Great Lithuanian Hetman and Field Lithuanian Hetman. During joint military operations of the Crown and Grand Duchy of Lithuania armies, the Grand Crown Hetman usually was considered superior to others hetmans and served as commander-in-chief if the war actions ran along the borders of the Grand Duchy and vice versa.

Grand Hetmans were usually in command of the professional and mobilised army and during peace stayed at the capital involving themselves in politics, guarding the interests of the army and planning campaigns.

Polish Field Hetman was subordinates of Grand Hetman and when on the same battlefield commanded the mercenaries and artillery. During peace they usually were deployed on the eastern and southern borders of the Commonwealth, and commanded all local forces against constant skirmishes and small invasions of the Ottoman Empire and its vassals. Field Hetman were also called Frontier Hetman, since they did the same job as commanders of frontier garrisons before the title of hetman was introduced.

Lithuanian Field Hetman initially was called Court Hetman and commanded the guard of the Grand Duke, while Land Hetman commanded militia. Later this difference disappeared and they were renamed Field and Great Hetmans accordingly. Contrary to Polish practice Lithuanian Field Hetman had full control on army under his command and wasn't subordinated to the Great Hetman.

For a short period there was also an office of Royal Court Hetman, but it never gained much influence.

Hetman's competences and privileges, first officially described in 1527 in the act of nomination for Jan Tarnowski included:

The hetman had no right to order the forces of the royal court, the royal guard, units equipped by the cities and towns, or private individuals, although during wars those units often voluntarily pledged their obedience to hetmans. Hetmans had no control over the navy, although the Polish Navy was always of very limited importance. Hetmans usually had no direct control over the levy (pospolite ruszenie), but they could give orders to the regimentars who commanded it.

While hetmans were considered to be among the highest-ranking officials in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, their hetman status gave them no right to sit in either the Senate or Sejm, unless they held another office that automatically carried with it a seat or were elected as a representatives of local szlachta during sejmiks. Each hetman received a hetman's ceremonial mace, the bulawa, as the symbol of his position (it was added to his coat of arms). Less common was a horse-tail ensign and hetman's sign.

In some of the never realised plans of reconstruction of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from dual into triple state (Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth), the hetman was to be a head of the Ruthenian part, consisting of three Ukrainian voivodeships (see Treaty of Hadiach).

The reforms of 1776, stimulated by the first Partition of Poland,  limited the powers of the hetmans.

A hetman's chief aides and officers included:

Most of those aides also had a Field/Great and Crown/Lithuanian add-ons to their titles, depending on which hetman they were serving under.

Several new military titles were created after the 1635 by king Władysław IV Vasa, changing some of hetman's responsibilities:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetmans_of_the_Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth
Flag of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic,"The flag of the Lithuanian SSR was first adopted by the Lithuanian SSR in 1918, which was a plain red flag. After the Lithuanian SSR was established again in 1940, the flag was a red flag with the national name and a hammer and sickle in the upper canton. The flag in use from 1953 to 1988 was a red flag with the golden hammer and sickle and a gold-bordered red star in its upper canton with a white thin stripe and green thick band on the bottom.

During the Lithuanian–Soviet War, the first Lithuanian SSR used a plain red flag. This was later adopted by Lithuanian–Byelorussian SSR (Litbel).

When Lithuanian SSR was established again as a republic of the USSR, it adopted a new national flag on 30 July 1940. The flag was red with the Latin characters LIETUVOS TSR (Lithuanian SSR in the Lithuanian language) in gold sans-serif typeface in the upper canton, and a gold hammer and sickle below the text.[1]

On 15 July 1953, a new flag was adopted. It was modified to meet the new requirements for all flags of the Soviet socialist republics.[1] The top red portion took 2⁄3 of the width and incorporated the mandatory hammer and sickle and red star. The bottom part could be customized by each republic.[1] Lithuania added a narrow white (1⁄12 of the width) and a larger green (1⁄4 of the width) strips.[2] The green and white stripes thus represented the country's wide fields and forests, which serve the country's agricultural and forestry industries.

On 18 November 1988, the tricolour of Lithuania was adopted as the flag of the SSR, even before Lithuania declared independence in March 1990. The Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, inspired by pro-independence Sąjūdis, amended the constitution and adopted the tricolour flag of Lithuania that was used during the interwar years.[3]

Since Lithuania banned Soviet symbols in 2008, raising or otherwise using the Lithuanian SSR flag in public is illegal.[4]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic
German occupation of Lithuania during World War II,"The military occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany lasted from the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, to the end of the Battle of Memel on January 28, 1945. At first the Germans were welcomed as liberators from the repressive Soviet regime which had occupied Lithuania. In hopes of re-establishing independence or regaining some autonomy, Lithuanians organized a Provisional Government that lasted six weeks.

In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact and its Secret Additional Protocol, dividing Central and Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Lithuania was initially assigned to the German sphere, likely due to its economic dependence on German trade. After the March 1939 ultimatum regarding the Klaipėda Region, Germany accounted for 75% of Lithuanian exports and 86% of its imports.[1] To solidify its influence, Germany suggested a German–Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region, but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality.[2] When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the Wehrmacht took control of the Lublin Voivodeship and eastern Warsaw Voivodeship, which were in the Soviet sphere of influence. To compensate the Soviet Union for this loss, a secret codicil to the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty transferred Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence,[3] which was the justification for the Soviet Union to occupying Lithuania on June 15, 1940 and establishing the Lithuanian SSR.

Almost immediately after the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, the Soviets pressured the Lithuanians into signing the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. According to this treaty, Lithuania gained about 6,880 square kilometres (2,660 sq mi) of territory in the Vilnius Region (including Vilnius, Lithuania's historical capital) in return for allowing five Soviet military bases in Lithuania (total 20,000 troops).[4] The territories that Lithuania received from the Soviet Union were former territories of the Second Polish Republic, disputed between Poland and Lithuania since the Polish-Lithuanian War of 1920 and occupied by the Soviet Union following the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. The Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty was described by The New York Times as a ""virtual sacrifice of independence.""[5] Similar pacts were proposed to Latvia, Estonia, and Finland. Finland was the only state to refuse, and that sparked the Winter War. This war delayed the occupation of Lithuania: the Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs[6] and Russian soldiers were well-behaved in their bases.[7] As the Winter War ended in March and Germany was making rapid advances in the Battle of France, the Soviets heightened their anti-Lithuanian rhetoric and accused Lithuanians of kidnapping Soviet soldiers from their bases. Despite Lithuanian attempts to negotiate and resolve the issues, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum on June 14, 1940.[8] Lithuanians accepted the ultimatum and Soviet military took control of major cities by June 15. The following day identical ultimatums were issued to Latvia and Estonia. To legitimize the occupation, the Soviets staged elections to the so-called People's Seimas, which then asked to join the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.[9] This allowed Soviet propaganda claiming that Lithuania has voluntarily joined the Soviet Union.

Soon after the occupation started, Sovietization policies were implemented. On July 1, all political, cultural, and religious organizations were closed,[11] with only the Communist Party of Lithuania and its youth branch  allowed to exist. All banks (including all accounts above 1,000 litas), real estate larger than 170 square metres (1,800 sq ft), private enterprises with more than 20 workers or more than 150,000 litas of gross receipts were nationalized.[12] This disruption in management and operations created a sharp drop in production. Russian soldiers and officials were eager to spend their appreciated rubles and caused massive shortages of goods.[13] To turn small peasants against large landowners, collectivization was not introduced in Lithuania. All land was nationalized, farms were reduced to 30 hectares (74 acres), and extra land (some 575,000 hectares (5,750 km2)) was distributed to small farmers.[14] In preparation for eventual collectivization, new taxes between 30% and 50% of farm production were enacted.[11] The Lithuanian litas was artificially depreciated to 3–4 times its actual value and withdrawn by March 1941.[14] Before the elections to the People's Parliament, the Soviets arrested some 2,000 prominent political activists.[13] These arrests paralyzed any attempts to create anti-Soviet groups. An estimated 12,000 were imprisoned as ""enemies of the people.""[13] When farmers were unable to meet exorbitant new taxes, some 1,100 of the larger farmers were put on trial.[15] On June 14–18, 1941, less than a week before Germany's invasion, some 17,000 Lithuanians were deported to Siberia, where many perished due to inhumane living conditions (see June deportation).[16][17] Some of the many political prisoners were massacred by the retreating Red Army. These persecutions were key in soliciting support for the Nazis.

On June 22, 1941, the territory of the Lithuanian SSR was invaded by two advancing German army groups: Army Group North, which took over western and northern Lithuania, and Army Group Centre, which took over most of the Vilnius Region. The first attacks were carried out by the Luftwaffe against Lithuanian cities and claimed lives of some 4,000 civilians.[19] Most Russian aircraft were destroyed on the ground. Germans rapidly advanced, encountering only sporadic resistance from the Soviets and help from Lithuanians, who saw them as liberators and hoped that the Germans would re-establish their independence or at least autonomy.[citation needed]

Lithuanians took up arms against the Soviet for independence. Groups of men took control of strategic objects such as railroads, bridges, communication equipment and food warehouses, protecting them from potential scorched earth tactics. Kazys Škirpa, founder of LAF, had been preparing for the uprising since at least March 1941. The activists proclaimed Lithuanian independence and established the Provisional Government of Lithuania on June 23. Vilnius was taken by soldiers of the 29th Lithuanian Territorial Corps, many of them deserters from the Red Army, which had gang-pressed them when Lithuania and the Lithuanian Army changed hands. Smaller, less organized groups emerged in other cities and in the countryside.

The Battle of Raseiniai began June 23 as Soviets attempted to mount a counterattack, reinforced by tanks, but were overpowered by the 27th.[20] It is estimated that the uprising involved some 16,000[21] to 30,000 people and claimed lives of about 600 Lithuanians[21] and 5,000 Soviet activists. On June 24, Germans entered both Kaunas and Vilnius without a fight.[22] 
Within a week, the Germans had sustained 3,362 losses, but controlled the entire country.[23]

During the first days of war, German military administration, chiefly concerned with the region's security, tolerated Lithuanian attempts to establish their own administrative institutions and left a number of civilian issues to the Lithuanians. The Provisional Government in Kaunas attempted to establish the proclaimed independence of Lithuania and undo the damage of the one-year Soviet regime. During the six weeks of its existence, the Government issued about 100 laws and decrees, but they were largely not enforced. Its policies can be described as both anti-Soviet and antisemitic.[citation needed] The government organized volunteer forces, known as the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas (TDA), to serve as a basis for the re-established Lithuanian Army, but the battalion was soon employed by the Einsatzkommando 3 and Rollkommando Hamann for mass executions of the Lithuanian Jews in the Ninth Fort. At the time a rogue unit led by the infamous Algirdas Klimaitis rampaged through the city and the outskirts.[citation needed]

The Germans did not recognize the Lithuanian government, and at the end of July formed their own civil administration, part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland, which was divided into four Generalbezirke (General Districts). Adrian von Renteln became the Generalkommisssar of Generalbezirk Litauen and took over all government functions in Lithuania. The Provisional Government resigned on August 5; some of its ministers became General Advisers (Lithuanian: generalinis tarėjas) in charge of local self-government. The Germans did not have enough manpower to staff local administration; therefore, most local offices were headed by the Lithuanians. Policy decisions would have been made by high-ranking Germans and actually implemented by low-ranking Lithuanians. The General Advisers were mostly a rubber stamp institution that the Germans used as a scapegoat for unpopular decisions. Three of the advisers resigned within months, and other four were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp when they protested several German policies. Overall, local self-government was quite developed in Lithuania and helped to sabotage or hinder several German initiatives, including raising a Waffen-SS unit or providing men for forced labor in Germany.[citation needed]

Before the Holocaust, Lithuania was home to about 210,000[24] or 250,000[25] Jews and was one of the greatest centers of Jewish theology, philosophy, and learning which preceded even the times of the Gaon of Vilna. The Holocaust in Lithuania can be divided into three stages: mass executions (June–December 1941), ghetto period (1942 – March 1943), and final liquidation (April 1943 – July 1944).

Unlike in other Nazi-occupied countries where the Holocaust was introduced gradually (first limiting Jewish civil rights, then concentrating Jews in ghettos, and only then executing them in death camps), executions in Lithuania started on the first days of war. Einsatzkommando A entered Lithuania one day behind the Wehrmacht invasion to encourage self-cleansing.[26]: 107  According to German documents, on June 25–26, 1941, ""about 1,500 Jews were eliminated by Lithuanian partisans. Many Jewish synagogues were set on fire; on the following nights another 2,300 were killed.""[27] The killings provided justification for rounding up Jews and putting them in ghettos to ""protect them"", where by December 1941 in Kaunas, 15,000 remained, 22,000 having been executed.[26]: 110  The executions were carried out at three main groups: in Kaunas (Ninth Fort), in Vilnius (Ponary massacre), and in countryside (Rollkommando Hamann). In Lithuania, by 1 December 1941, over 120,000 Lithuanian Jews had been killed.[26]: 110  It is estimated that 80% of the Lithuanian Jews were killed before 1942,[28] many by or with the active participation of Lithuanians in units, such as Police Battalions.[26]: 148

The surviving 43,000 Jews were concentrated in the Vilnius, Kaunas, Šiauliai, and Švenčionys Ghettos and forced to work for the benefit of German military industry. On June 21, 1943, Heinrich Himmler issued an order to liquidate all ghettos and transfer the remaining Jews to concentration camps. Vilnius Ghetto was liquidated, while Kaunas and Šiauliai were turned into concentration camps and survived until July 1944.[29] Remaining Jews were sent to camps in Stutthof, Dachau, Auschwitz. Only about 2,000–3,000 of Lithuanian Jews were liberated from these camps.[29] More survived by withdrawing into Russia's interior before the war broke out or by escaping the ghettos and joining the Jewish partisans.

The genocide rate of Jews in Lithuania, up to 95–97%, was the highest in Europe. This was primarily due, with few notable exceptions, to widespread Lithuanian cooperation with the German authorities. Jews were widely blamed for the previous Soviet regime (see Jewish Bolshevism) and were resented for welcoming Soviet troops.[30] Targeted Nazi propaganda exploited the anti-Soviet sentiment and increased already existing, traditional anti-Semitism.[31]

Lithuanians formed several units that actively assisted Germans:[32]

10 of the Lithuanian police battalions, working with the Nazi Einsatzkommando, were involved in mass killings, and are thought to have executed 78,000 individuals.[26]: 148

As many as 15,000 - 20,000 Lithuanians worked in the General District of Lithuania and the Reich. A 12,000 – in the Luftwaffe, 400 – in Reich Labour Service,  and 15,000 in the Todt Organisation.[33]

Many members of the Lithuanian construction units were asked to join the Waffen-SS, of whom up to 40% eventually did, although no Lithuanian national unit was ever formed under the Waffen-SS, and all volunteers served on an individual basis. [34]

The majority of anti-Nazi resistance in Lithuania came from the Polish partisans and the Soviet partisans.[citation needed] Both began sabotage and guerrilla operations against German forces immediately after the Nazi invasion of 1941. The most important Polish resistance organization in Lithuania was, as elsewhere in occupied Poland, the Home Army (Armia Krajowa). The Polish commander of the Wilno (Vilnius) region was Aleksander Krzyżanowski.

The activities of Soviet partisans in Lithuania were partly coordinated by the Command of the Lithuanian Partisan Movement headed by Antanas Sniečkus and partly by the Central Command of the Partisan Movement of the USSR.[35]

Jewish partisans in Lithuania also fought against the Nazi occupation. In September 1943, the United Partisan Organization led by Abba Kovner, attempted to start an uprising in the Vilna Ghetto, and later engaged in sabotage and guerrilla operations against the Nazi occupation.[36][unreliable source?] In July 1944, as part of its Operation Tempest, the Polish Home Army launched Operation Ostra Brama in an attempt to recapture that city.[citation needed]

There was no significant violent resistance directed against the Nazis originating from the Lithuanian society. In 1943, several underground political groups united under the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (Vyriausias Lietuvos išlaisvinimo komitetas or VLIK). It became mostly active outside of Lithuania among emigrants and deportees, and was able to establish contacts in Western countries and get support for resistance operations inside Lithuania (see Operation Jungle). It persisted abroad for many years as one of the groups representing Lithuania in exile.[37][38]

In 1943, the Nazis attempted to raise a Waffen-SS division from the local population as they had in other countries, but widespread coordination between resistance groups led to a boycot. The Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (Lietuvos vietinė rinktinė) was eventually formed in 1944 under Lithuanian command, but was disbanded by the Nazis only a few months later for refusing to obey orders.[39][40][41] In particular, the relations between Lithuanians and the Poles were poor. Pre-war tensions over the Vilnius Region resulted in a low-level conflict between Poles and Lithuanians.[42] Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian units, primarily the Lithuanian Secret Police,[42] were active in the region and assisted the Germans in repressing the Polish population. In autumn 1943, Armia Krajowa started retaliation operations against the Lithuanian units and killed hundreds of mostly Lithuanian policemen and other collaborators during the first half of 1944. The conflict culminated in the massacres of Polish and Lithuanian civilians in June 1944 in the Glitiškės (Glinciszki) and Dubingiai (Dubinki) massacres.

The Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania as part of the Baltic Offensive in 1944, a two-fold military-political operation to rout German forces and ""liberate the Soviet Baltic peoples""[43] beginning in summer 1944.

Lithuania suffered significant losses in World War II and the first post-war decade. Historians attempted to quantify population losses and changes, but their task was complicated by the lack of precise and reliable data. There were no censuses taken between the 1923, when Lithuania had 2,028,971 residents,[44] and the Soviet census of 1959, when Lithuania had 2,711,400 residents.[45] Various authors provide different breakdowns but generally agree that the population losses between 1940 and 1953 were more than one million people, a third of the pre-war population.[46][47][48][49] The three largest categories of this number are:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Lithuania_during_World_War_II

Christianization of Lithuania,"The Christianization of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos krikštas) occurred in 1387, initiated by the Lithuanian royals Jogaila, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his cousin Vytautas the Great. It signified the official adoption of Catholic Christianity by Lithuania, the last pagan country in Europe.[1] However, Lithuania's first ruler to be baptised was Mindaugas in 1250s. This event ended one of the most complicated and lengthiest processes of Christianization in European history.

Lithuanians' contacts with the Christian religion predated the establishment of the Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century. The first known record of the name Lithuania (Litua), recorded in the Holy Roman Empire's Annals of Quedlinburg in 1009, relates to Chalcedonian missionaries led by Bruno of Querfurt, who baptised several rulers of the Yotvingians, a nearby Baltic tribe. However, Lithuanians had more active contacts with the Kievan Rus' and subsequent Eastern Slavic states, which had adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity following the Christianization of Kievan Rus' in the 10th century.

As the dukes of Lithuania extended their dominion eastwards, the influence of the Slavic states on their culture increased. Their subordinates and the people followed their example, borrowing, for instance, many of the East Slavic versions of Christian names in the 11th–12th centuries. This borrowing became increasingly widespread among the pagan population in Aukštaitija, though much less so in Samogitia. The influence of Orthodox Christianity on pagan Lithuanian culture is evidenced in about one-third of present-day Lithuanian surnames which are constructed from baptismal names are Old Church Slavonic in origin.[2] In addition, the Lithuanian words for ""church"", ""baptism"", ""Christmas"" and ""fast"" are classed as loanwords from Ruthenian rather than Polish.[3]

The emergence of a monastic state of the Livonian Order around the Lithuanian borders made it rather urgent to choose a state religion. The first Lithuanian Grand Duke to adopt Western Christianity was Mindaugas, although his nephew and rival Tautvilas had done that earlier, in 1250. The first translations of Catholic prayers from German were made during his reign and have been known since.[4][5]

In 1249, Tautvilas' ally Daniel of Galicia attacked Navahradak, and in 1250, another ally of Tautvilas, the Livonian Order, organized a major raid against Nalšia land and Mindaugas' domains in Lithuania proper. Attacked from the south and north and facing the possibility of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position, but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian Order and the Archbishop of Riga in his own interests. In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return.

Mindaugas and his family were baptised in the Catholic rite in 1250 or 1251. On July 17, 1251  Pope Innocent IV issued a papal bull proclaiming Lithuania a Kingdom and the state was placed under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. Mindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned at some time during the summer of 1253, and the Kingdom of Lithuania, formally a Christian state, was established. Even after nominally becoming a Catholic, King Mindaugas did not cease sacrificing to his own gods.[6] Despite the ruling family's baptism, Lithuania had not become a truly Christian state, since there were no fruitful efforts to convert its population; Lithuanians and Samogitians  stood firmly for their ancestral religion. Some of this might be attributed to the Golden Horde tumanbashi Burundaj's campaign in 1259 and 1260, which caused destruction in Lithuania proper and Nalšia.

Mindaugas' successors did not express enough interest in following in his footsteps. There were decades of vacillation between the Latin and the Orthodox options.[7] ""For Gediminas and Algirdas, retention of paganism provided a useful diplomatic tool and weapon... that allowed them to use promises of conversion as a means of preserving their power and independence"".[8] Grand Duke Algirdas had pursued an option of ""dynamic balance"". Throughout his reign, he teased both Avignon and Constantinople with the prospects of a conversion;[9] several unsuccessful attempts were made to negotiate the conversion of Lithuania.[10]

To avoid further clashes with the Teutonic Order, in 1349, Lithuanian co-ruler Kęstutis started the negotiations with Pope Clement VI for the conversion and had been promised royal crowns for himself and his sons. Algirdas willingly remained aside of the business and dealt with the order in the Ruthenian part of the state. The intermediary in the negotiations, Polish King Casimir III, made an unexpected assault on Volhynia and Brest in October 1349 that ruined Kęstutis' plan.  During the Polish-Lithuanian war for Volhynia, King Louis I of Hungary offered a peace agreement to Kęstutis on 15 August 1351, according to which Kęstutis obliged himself to accept Christianity and provide the Kingdom of Hungary with military aid, in exchange of the royal crown. Kęstutis confirmed the agreement by performing a pagan ritual[11] to convince the other side. In fact, Kęstutis had no intentions to abide the agreement and ran away on his way to Buda.[12]

By the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had emerged as a successor to Kievan Rus in the western part of its dominions.[13] Although its sovereign was pagan, the majority of the population was Slavic and Orthodox. To legitimize their rule in these areas, the Lithuanian royalty frequently married into the Orthodox Rurikid aristocracy of Eastern Europe. As a result, some Lithuanian rulers were baptised into Eastern Orthodoxy either as children (Švitrigaila) or adults. The first one was Vaišelga, son and heir of Mindaugas, who took monastic vows at an Orthodox monastery in Lavrashev[14] near Novgorodok and later established a convent there.[15]

The final attempt to Christianize Lithuania was made by Jogaila. Jogaila's Russian mother urged him to marry Sofia, daughter of Prince Dmitri of Moscow, who required him first to convert to Orthodoxy and to make Lithuania a fief of the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[16] That option, however, was unrealistic and unlikely to halt the crusades against Lithuania by the Teutonic Order. Jogaila chose therefore to accept a Polish proposal to become a Catholic and marry Jadwiga of Poland. On these and other terms, on 14 August 1385, at the castle of Krėva, Jogaila agreed to adopt Christianity, signing the Act of Krėva.

Jogaila was duly baptised at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 and became Władysław II Jagiełło, the King of Poland. The royal baptism was followed by the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and knights,[17] as well as Jogaila's brothers Karigaila, Vygantas, Švitrigaila and cousin Vytautas. Jogaila sent Dobrogost, Bishop of Poznań, as ambassador to Pope Urban VI with a petition for the erection of an episcopal see at Vilnius and the appointment of Andrzej Jastrzębiec to fill it.

Jogaila returned to Lithuania in February 1387. The baptism of nobles and their peasants was at first carried out in the capital Vilnius and its environs. The nobility and some peasants in Aukštaitija were baptized in spring, followed by the rest of the Lithuanian nobility. The parishes were established in ethnic Lithuania and the new Vilnius Cathedral was built in 1387 on the site of a demolished pagan temple.  According to the information of disputed accuracy provided by Jan Długosz, the first parochial churches were built in Lithuanian pagan towns Vilkmergė, Maišiagala, Lida, Nemenčinė, Medininkai, Kreva, Haina and Abolcy, all belonging to the Jogaila's patrimony. Jogaila destroyed the old places of worship: altars, sacred groves, killed grass snakes and other snakes that were regarded as divine guardians of households at the time.[18] The papal bull issued by Pope Urban VI on 12 March 1388 has information about destruction of pagan cult objects in Vilnius and provided legal grounds for establishment of the Vilnius Cathedral.[1] On 19 April 1389, Pope Urban VI recognized the status of Lithuania as a Roman Catholic state.[19] Lithuania was the last state in Europe to be Christianized.[1]

Samogitia was the last ethnic region of Lithuania to become Christianized in 1413, following the defeat of the Teutonic Order in the Battle of Grunwald and the Peace of Thorn and its subsequent return to the Lithuanian control.[20] In November 1413,  Vytautas himself sailed Neman River and Dubysa, reached the environs of Betygala, where he baptised the first groups of Samogitians.[21] In 1416, the construction of eight first parochial churches was started. The Diocese of Samogitia was established on 23 October 1417 and Matthias of Trakai became the first Bishop of Samogitia.[22] The cathedral was built in Medininkai around 1464.[20]

Ethnic Lithuanian nobles were the main converts to Catholicism, but paganism remained strong among the peasantry. Pagan customs prevailed for a long time among the common people of Lithuania and were covertly practiced. There had been no persecution of priests and adherents of the old faith. However, by the 17th century, following the Counter-Reformation (1545–1648), the Roman Catholic faith had essentially taken precedence over earlier pagan beliefs.

The conversion and its political implications had lasting repercussions for the history of Lithuania. As the majority of the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania outside Lithuania proper was Orthodox and the elite gradually converted to Roman Catholicism, religious tensions increased. Some of the Orthodox Gediminids left Lithuania for Muscovy, where they gave rise to such families as the Galitzine and the Troubetzkoy. The Orthodox population of present-day Ukraine and eastern Belarus often sympathized with the rulers of Muscovy, who portrayed themselves as the champions of Orthodoxy. These feelings contributed to such reverses as the Battle of Vedrosha, which crippled the Grand Duchy and undermined its position as a dominant power in Eastern Europe.

On the other hand, the conversion to Roman Catholicism facilitated Lithuania's integration into the cultural sphere of Central Europe and paved the way to the political alliance of Lithuania and Poland, finalized as the Union of Lublin in 1569.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Lithuania

Grand Chancellor of Lithuania,"The Grand Chancellor of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos didysis kancleris) was one of the highest offices in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The office functioned from the middle of the 15th century until the end of the real union with the Kingdom of Poland in 1795 and its subsequent partition among Prussia, Russia and Austria.[1] The chancellor possessed the Great Seal of Lithuania and had the Lithuanian Metrica at his disposal.[2]

It is thought that the role of chancellor originated from court positions of the manor of the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Although the role of a state chancellor existed since the times of Grand Duke Vytautas, it formally appeared during the reign of Casimir IV Jagiellon.[1] The expanding territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the increasing value of land, property as well as judicial institutions meant an increased need for written documents. The needs of Vytautas's political diplomacy with the Grand Duchy of Moscow, Byzantine Empire and tatars were met with the creation of two chancelleries - the first of which would prepare documents in Latin and German, while the second would prepare documents in Russian. Eleven scribes worked in those offices, some of whom were sent by Vytautas's cousin and king of Poland, Jogaila, from his estate in Poland (Mikalojus Cebulka and Mikalojus Maldrzykas are examples of such scribes). It is known that three scribes came from the Teutonic Order. Scribes from Volhynia were given the task of assisting in writing Ruthenian, although it is believed that some Ruthenian documents were prepared by Lithuanians.[3] Up until the Union of Lublin the role of the Grand Chancellor would be the second highest next to the Grand Duke since he would usually reside in Poland and consequently Grand Chancellor oversaw most of the Grand Duchy's politics as well as the Lithuanian Council of Lords.[1]

Since official roles weren't yet formalized, the scribe's office would be categorized as either a simple scribe or the secretary of the Grand Duke. During the reign of Casimir IV Jagiellon, the chancellery would be fully established. Its first grand chancellor was Sudivojus Valimantaitis. During the reign of Alexander Jagiellon, the chancellery became the center of the politics of the Grand Duchy. Offices became categorized into treasury-related matters and diplomacy-related matters. The Grand Chancellor would usually be a member of a noble magnate family, such as the Radziwill, Sapieha, Gasztowt families. Up until the creation of the Lithunaian Tribunal in 1581, the Grand Chancellor led the Grand Duchy's Supreme Court. In the 16th century, the number of scribes as well as literacy itself increased; tariffs and taxes would be more frequently and effectively checked within the country's territory. The Grand Chancellor would usually have a second role of being the Voivode of Vilnius as well as the Castellan of Vilnius,[3] although this practice would later be abandoned. Until the creation of the Permanent Council, the Grand Chancellor would oversee relations with the Russian Empire.[1]

Today the office of the chancellor has been replaced by that of the Prime Minister of Lithuania.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Chancellor_of_Lithuania
Lithuanian National Revival,"The Lithuanian National Revival, alternatively the Lithuanian National Awakening or Lithuanian nationalism (Lithuanian: Lietuvių tautinis atgimimas), was a period of the history of Lithuania in the 19th century, when a major part of Lithuanian-inhabited areas belonged to the Russian Empire (the Russian partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). It was expressed by the rise of self-determination of the Lithuanians that led to the formation of the modern Lithuanian nation and culminated in the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian state. The most active participants of the national revival included Vincas Kudirka and Jonas Basanavičius. The period largely corresponded to the rise of romantic nationalism and other national revivals of 19th-century Europe.

The revival was predated by a short period of the early 19th century known as the ""Samogitian revival"" led by students of Vilnius University, including Simonas Daukantas and Simonas Stanevičius. The most recent Lithuanian national revival may be linked to the late 20th century developments also known as the Singing Revolution.

Due to a long period of common Polish-Lithuanian statehood and nationality, and the Russian Empire's policy of Russification, many of the Lithuanian nobles in the 19th century had become Polonized and the language was generally used only by the poor and by the middle classes; some of the latter tended to use Polish as a status symbol for social advancement. Lithuanian was generally a spoken language and was not considered prestigious enough for written usage; it was, however, retained by some members of the minor nobility, especially in the Samogitian region. The language was not yet standardized; its grammar varied greatly from region to region in form of Aukštaitijan and Samogitian dialects and their sub-dialects. There were even expectations that the Lithuanian language would become extinct, as the eastern territories within what is modern-day Lithuania and northwestern Belarus became increasingly Slavicized,[1] and many people used Polish or Belarusian in their daily lives. At the beginning of the 19th century, the use of the Lithuanian language was largely limited to Lithuanian rural areas; the only area where Lithuanian was considered suitable for literature was German-controlled Lithuania Minor in East Prussia. Even here, an influx of German immigrants threatened the native language and Prussian Lithuanian culture.

Several factors contributed to its subsequent revival: the language drew attention from scholars of the emerging science of comparative linguistics; after the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861, social mobility increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; and language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe.[2] Within the Catholic Church, the barriers that had earlier prevented commoners from entering the priesthood were eased. A closer relationship developed between the educated clergy, who were increasingly of ethnic Lithuanian stock, and their parishioners, including empathy for their wish to use the Lithuanian language.[3] The emerging national movement sought to distance itself from both Polish and Russian influences, and the use of the Lithuanian language was seen as an important aspect of this movement.
[4]

The development of Lithuanian national culture and national identity was further burdened by the Lithuanian press ban, one of the repressive measures that followed the 1863 uprising. After the uprising, serfdom was finally abandoned. The revival began among young educated people of Lithuanian extraction who attended higher education studies at the universities of the Russian Empire and foreign states. Many were sons of wealthy farmers in origin and thus, having come from the peasant class was least affected by Polonisation. The movement resulted in the publication of the Lithuanian newspapers Aušra and Varpas, followed by the publication of poems and books in Lithuanian. These writings romanticized the past of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, depicting the nation as formerly a great power with many heroes.

The revival spearheaded the independence movement, with various organizations opposing Russification and Russian influence. Russian policy became harsher in response, and there were known instances of attacks on Catholic churches; meanwhile, a ban on the Lithuanian press continued. Yet even with a press ban, the literacy of Lithuanians continued to rise significantly and was one of the greatest among the nations in the Russian Empire, behind only Finns, Estonians and Latvians. The political Lithuanian nation had already been formed by the end of the 19th century. Political claims were voiced in the Great Seimas of Vilnius, and political and cultural activity continued to grow after the press ban was finally lifted in 1904.

The first important study on the Lithuanian national revival was written by Michał Pius Römer in 1908 - Lietuva. Studija apie lietuvių tautos atgimimą (Litwa. Studyum o odrodzeniu narodu litewskiego, Lithuania: Study of national revival).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_National_Revival
Resistance in Lithuania during World War II,"During World War II, Lithuania was occupied twice by the Soviet Union (1940–1941; post-1944) and once by Nazi Germany (1941–1944). Resistance took many forms.

During the occupations, there arose parallel resistance movements in Lithuania that had competing goals due to the different priorities of the several ethnicities, besides the fringe Soviet collaborators whose fate was tied to the Soviet Union and were more united by ideology than ethnicity. For example, the anti-Nazi resistance in Lithuania was fractured into the Lithuanian anti-Nazi resistance (the Lithuanian Front, the Lithuanian Liberty Army, the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters and more), the Jewish partisans, the Polish Home Army and the Soviet partisans.[1] Notably, although the latter two resistance movements fought against Nazi occupation, they also fought for Lithuania's occupation by their respective countries.[citation needed] Many Polish resistance members were against the possibility of an independent Lithuania after the war's end.[2][needs independent confirmation]

In 1940, President Antanas Smetona fled to Germany, not wanting his government to become a puppet of the Soviet occupation. Soviet attempts to capture him were unsuccessful, and he was able to settle in the United States.

In 1940, Jan Zwartendijk, the Dutch consul in Kaunas, and Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, and his wife Yukiko disobeyed orders and saved thousands of Jewish refugees from Poland by granting them visas.[3]

In 1941, the Lithuanian Activist Front (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Aktyvistų Frontas) formed an underground government, and following the June uprising, the Provisional Government of Lithuania maintained sovereignty for a brief period.

Soviet partisans began sabotage and guerrilla operations against German forces immediately after the Nazi invasion of 1941. The activities of Soviet partisans in Lithuania were partly coordinated by the Command of the Lithuanian Partisan Movement headed by Antanas Sniečkus and partly by the Central Command of the Partisan Movement of the USSR.[4]

In 1943, the Nazis attempted to raise a Waffen-SS division from the local population as they had in many other countries, but due to widespread coordination between resistance groups, the mobilization was boycotted. The Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (Lietuvos vietinė rinktinė) was eventually formed in 1944 under Lithuanian command, but was liquidated by the Nazis only a few months later for refusing to subordinate to their command.[5][6][7]

There was no significant violent resistance directed against the Nazis. Some Lithuanians, encouraged by Germany's vague promises of autonomy,[8] cooperated with the Nazis. Pre-war tensions over the Vilnius Region resulted in a low-level civil war between Poles and Lithuanians.[9] Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian units, primarily the Lithuanian Security Police,[9] were active in the region and assisted the Germans in repressing the Polish population. In the autumn of 1943, the Home Army began retaliatory operations against the Lithuanian units and killed hundreds of mostly Lithuanian Auxiliary policemen and other collaborators during the first half of 1944.[citation needed] The conflict culminated in the massacres of Polish and Lithuanian civilians in June 1944 in the Glitiškės (Glinciszki) and Dubingiai (Dubinki) villages.

Also in 1943, several underground political groups united under the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (Vyriausias Lietuvos išlaisvinimo komitetas, or VLIK). The committee issued a declaration of independence that went largely unnoticed. It became active mostly outside Lithuania among emigrants and deportees, and was able to establish contacts in Western countries and get support for resistance operations inside Lithuania (see Operation Jungle). It would persist abroad for many years as one of the groups representing Lithuania in exile.[10][11]

Lithuanian Liberty Army during Nazi Germany's occupation opposed German policies, but did not begin armed resistance. The armed struggle began in mid-1944 when Red Army reached the Lithuanian borders after the Minsk Offensive. The LLA became the first wave of the Lithuanian partisans, armed anti-Soviet guerrilla fighters. It attempted to become the central command of the armed struggle. However, the organization headquarters was liquidated by the Soviet security forces (NKVD and KGB) by April 1946. Many Lithuanian Liberty Army fighters joined the wider movement of Lithuanian partisans.

Jewish partisans also fought against the Nazi occupation. In September 1943, the United Partisan Organization, led by Abba Kovner, attempted to start an uprising in the Vilna Ghetto, and later engaged in sabotage and guerrilla operations against the Nazi occupation.[12]

In July 1944, as part of its Operation Tempest, the Polish Home Army launched Operation Ostra Brama, an attempt to recapture that city.

As of January 2008, 723 Lithuanians were recognized by Israel as Righteous among the Nations for their efforts in saving Lithuania's Jews from the Holocaust.[13] The total number of people who helped the Jews is most definitely underestimated.[14]

Lithuanian partisans, known as the Forest Brothers, began guerrilla warfare against the Soviet forces as soon as the front passed over them in 1944, and continued an armed struggle until 1953. The core of this movement was made up of soldiers from the Territorial Defense Force who had disbanded with their weapons and uniforms and members of the Lithuanian Liberty Army, established in 1941. The underground had extensive clandestine radio and press.[15] Thousands of people engaged in active and passive resistance against the Soviet authorities.[10] The various resistance organizations eventually united under the Movement of the Struggle for the Freedom of Lithuania (Lietuvos Laisvės Kovų Sąjūdis, or LLKS), issuing a declaration of independence in 1949 that would ultimately be signed into law by the independent Republic of Lithuania in 1999.[16]
The most famous of these partisans is probably Juozas Lukša, author of several books during the resistance and the subject of a recent film.

While armed resistance ended in the 1950s, nonviolent resistance continued in various forms (e.g. through Lithuanians living abroad, the Catholic press, safeguarding local traditions and the Lithuanian language, the Sąjūdis movement, etc.), until 1991 when Russia recognized the independence declared by Lithuania on March 11, 1990.

February 16, the date that Lithuania first declared its independence in 1918, played an important symbolic role during this period. The call for volunteers for the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, the VLIK declaration of independence, and the LLKS declaration of independence were all made on February 16.

House of Giedroyć,"The House of Giedroyć (Polish pronunciation: [ˈɡʲɛdrɔjtɕ]; Lithuanian: Giedraitis; Russian: Гедройц; French: Guedroitz) is an aristocratic clan and family which traces its origins to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. According to the 16th century Lithuanian Chronicle, they are descendants of Prince Giedrius, a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis.

Many family members were important figures in Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, French and British history or culture.

Cultural regions of Lithuania,"Lithuania can be divided into five historical and cultural regions (called ethnographic regions). The exact borders are not fully clear, as the regions are not official political or administrative units. They are delimited by culture, such as country traditions, traditional lifestyle, songs, tales, etc. To some extent, regions correspond to the zones of Lithuanian language dialects. This correspondence, however, is by no means strict. For example, although the Dzūkian dialect is called South Aukštaitian, it does not mean that Dzūkija is part of Aukštaitija. In certain parts of some regions, dialects of other regions are spoken, while for example in Samogitia, there are three indigenous dialects (southern, northern and western Samogitian), some of which are subdivided into subdialects.[citation needed]

No region, except for Samogitia, has ever been a political or an administrative entity. Throughout most of Lithuanian history the cultural regions of Aukštaitija, Suvalkija and Dzūkija where together known as the historical land of Lithuania Proper which was the core of the Lithuanian state during the Grand Duchy era. However, some work was done recently to delineate their boundaries more clearly, as there is a project to change the system of counties in Lithuania into ethnographic regions, which would be called lands (žemės). This project is also supported by the view that with the limited functions of counties, 10 of them are not needed for Lithuania. Another supporting argument is that in other countries historical territories are being revived, while in Lithuania artificially made counties exist. The project was supported by the former president Rolandas Paksas, yet now it is not clear when or if the project will be completed at all. However, Dzūkija quite recently adopted the coat of arms and emblem which would be used if the reform were to be implemented. Alytus County, which lies almost entirely within Dzūkija, adopted soon afterwards a coat of arms that is based on the Dzūkija coat of arms. Samogitia has a flag and a coat of arms dating from the time of the Duchy of Samogitia;[citation needed] these symbols are considerably older[citation needed] than the flag of Lithuania. Lithuania Minor has a flag used since the 17th century,[citation needed] and an anthem originating from the 19th century. However, if the reform were to be implemented, most likely there would be just four lands, not five, because most of Lithuania minor is located within the modern borders of Russia (in the Kaliningrad Oblast) and many Lithuanians were expelled from there. The relatively small remaining part is also populated mostly by relative newcomers, as much of the local population died in the Second World War or was expelled. Therefore, Lithuania minor would probably be attached to Samogitia.

Even though the regions are not political/administrative entities, most regions have their ""capitals"" (cities which are commonly considered to be capitals). These cities are not necessarily the largest in the region.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_regions_of_Lithuania

Provisional Government of Lithuania,"The Provisional Government of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Laikinoji Vyriausybė) was an attempted provisional government to form an independent Lithuanian state in the last days of the first Soviet occupation and the first weeks of the German occupation of Lithuania during World War II in 1941.

It was secretly formed on 22 April 1941, announced on 23 June 1941, and dissolved on 5 August 1941.[1] It was formed by members of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) in Kaunas and Vilnius.

""The Lithuanian nation, tormented by the brutal Bolshevik terror, decided to build its future on the basis of national unity and social justice.""

The Lithuanian Activist Front announced the creation of the provisional government on 22 June 1941, as the June Uprising in Lithuania began.[3]

The Nazi regime envisioned Lithuania as a future part of Greater Germany, and was not much interested in Lithuanian independence. It did allow the Provisional Government to operate while it was useful.[citation needed]

Literary historian Juozas Ambrazevičius-Brazaitis became acting prime minister instead of Škirpa.[4]
He served from June 23, 1941 to August 5, 1941.

Vygantas Vareikis [lt] wrote that the Lithuanian Provisional Government ""did not encourage brutal actions"" against Jews or LAF leaders, and the local press proposed that only high-ranking Communist officials and NKVD officers should be punished by death.[5] Lithuanian rebels had liberated Lithuania by the time the Wehrmacht arrived, and rescued over 300 political prisoners who would have been killed by Cheka.[6] The June Uprising laid the foundations for anti-Nazi resistance that later transformed into an anti-Soviet resistance.[6] The Provisional Government did little to stop the anti-Jewish violence encouraged by the Nazis and the anti-Semitic leadership of the Lithuanian Activist Front. Lithuanian police battalions formed by the Provisional Government helped the Nazis carry out the Holocaust.[7] Stanislovas Stasiulis pictured the history of the Holocaust in Lithuania as ""three layers and periods."" The first, he wrote, involves the relationship between Lithuanians and Jews during the Nazi occupation, and the second followed the Soviet re-occupation.[8] The third period of interest covers the historiography since 1990, he wrote, which has attempted new and open discussions of the defensive (emigré) and ideological (Soviet) reactions to the Holocaust. The Soviet refusal to acknowledge the racialism of the Holocaust helped trigger a defensive cultural response known as double genocide theory, which equated the Holocaust and the Stalinist brutality meted out to Lithuanian by the Soviets. Considered by some a form of Holocaust trivialization, this paradigm has sometimes been taken as far as portraying Nazi pogroms as retaliation.

LAF leader Kazys Škirpa, former Lithuanian envoy to Germany, was named prime minister. But he was in Berlin and the Germans put him under house arrest. Rapolas Skipitis, another minister-to-be in Berlin, was prevented from leaving as well.[9] Vytautas Bulvičius was to become Minister of Defence but the Soviets arrested him on 2 June and General Stasys Raštikis replaced him.[10]

The Provisional Government dissolved in August 1941 after deciding that it had failed to achieve an autonomous if not independent Lithuania under German patronage.[citation needed]

Poles in Lithuania,"The Poles in Lithuania (Polish: Polacy na Litwie, Lithuanian: Lietuvos lenkai), also called Lithuanian Poles,[3][4] estimated at 183,000 people in the 2021 Lithuanian census or 6.5% of Lithuania's total population, are the country's largest ethnic minority.

During the Polish–Lithuanian union, there was an influx of Poles into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the gradual Polonization of its elite and upper classes. At the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, almost all of Lithuania's nobility, clergy, and townspeople spoke Polish and adopted Polish culture, while still maintaining a Lithuanian identity.[5] Polonization also affected Lithuanian and Belarusian peasants and led to the formation of a long strip of land with a predominantly Polish population in the late 19th century, stretching to Daugavpils and including Vilnius. The rise of Polish nationalism and the Lithuanian National Revival led to conflicts between both groups, that, following World War I and the rebirth of both states, escalated into the Polish–Lithuanian War, whose main focus was Vilnius and the nearby region. In its aftermath, the majority of the Polish population living in the Lithuanian lands found themselves within the Polish borders, although many remained in interwar Lithuania. During World War II, the Polish population was persecuted by the USSR and Nazi Germany. Post-World War II, the borders were changed, territorial disputes were suppressed as the Soviet Union exercised power over both countries and a significant part of the Polish population, especially the best-educated, resettled from the Lithuanian SSR to the Polish People's Republic. At the same time, a significant number of Poles relocated from nearby regions of Byelorussian SSR to Vilnius and Vilnius region. After Lithuania regained independence, Lithuania–Poland relations were tense in the 1990s due to alleged discrimination of the Polish minority in Lithuania.[6][7][8][9][10]

Currently, the Polish population is grouped in the Vilnius region, primarily the Vilnius and Šalčininkai districts. In the city of Vilnius alone there are more than 85,000 Poles, who make up about 15% of the Lithuanian capital's population. Most Poles in Lithuania are Roman Catholic and speak Polish, although a minority of them speak Russian or Lithuanian, as their first language. Together with Vilnius City, Poles inhabit an area of approximately 4000 km2.

According to the 2021 Lithuanian census, the Polish minority in Lithuania numbered 183,421 persons or 6.5% of the population of Lithuania. It is the largest ethnic minority in Lithuania, the second largest being the Russian minority. Poles are concentrated in the Vilnius Region. Most Poles live in Vilnius County (170,919 people, or 21% of the county's population); Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, has 85,438 Poles, or 15.4% of the city's population. Especially large Polish communities are found in the district municipalities of Vilnius (46% of the population) and Šalčininkai (76%).

Lithuanian municipalities with a Polish minority exceeding 15% of the total population (according to the 2021 census) are listed in the table below:

The adoption of Polish cultural features by the nobles, townspeople, and clergy in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, combined with an influx of migrants from Poland, created a Lithuanian variant of the Polish language.[19] The local variety of Polish called Polszczyzna Litewska became the native tongue of the Lithuanian nobility in the 18th century.[20]

According to Polish professor Jan Otrębski's article published in 1931, the Polish dialect in the Vilnius Region and in the northeastern areas in general are very interesting variant of Polishness as this dialect developed in a foreign territory which was mostly inhabited by the Lithuanians who were Belarusized (mostly) or Polonized, and to prove this Otrębski provided examples of Lithuanianisms in the Tutejszy language.[21][22] In 2015, Polish linguist Mirosław Jankowiak [pl] attested that many of the Vilnius Region's inhabitants who declare Polish nationality speak a Belarusian dialect which they call mowa prosta ('simple speech').[23]

Out of the 234,989 Poles in Lithuania,[when?] 187,918 (80.0%) consider Polish to be their first language. 22,439 Poles (9.5%) speak Russian as their first language, while 17,233 (7.3%) speak Lithuanian. 6,279 Poles (2.7%) did not indicate their first language. The remaining 0.5% speak various other languages.[24] The Polish regiolect spoken by Lithuanian Poles is classified under Northern Borderlands dialect.[25] Most of Poles who live southwards of Vilnius speak a form of Belarusian vernacular called there ""simple speech"",[26] that contains many substratical relics from Lithuanian and Polish.[27]

As of 1980, about 20% of Polish Lithuanian students chose Polish as the language of instruction at school.[28] In the same year, about 60–70% of rural Polish communities chose Polish. However, even in towns with a predominantly Polish population, the share of Polish-language education was less than the percentage of Poles. Even though, historically, Poles tended to strongly oppose Russification, one of the most important reasons to choose Russian language education was the absence of a Polish-language college and university learning in the USSR, and during Soviet times Polish students in Lithuania were not allowed to get college/university education across the border in Poland. Only in 2007, the first small branch of the Polish University of Białystok opened in Vilnius. In 1980 there were 16,400 school students instructed in Polish. Their number declined to 11,400 in 1990. In independent Lithuania between 1990 and 2001, the number of Polish mother tongue children attending schools with Polish as the language of instruction doubled to over 22,300, then gradually decreased to 18,392 in 2005.[29] In September 2003, there were 75 Polish-language general education schools and 52 which provided education in Polish in a combination of languages (for example Lithuanian-Polish, Lithuanian-Russian-Polish). These numbers fell to 49 and 41 in 2011, reflecting a general decline in the number of schools in Lithuania.[30] Polish government was concerned in 2015 about the education in Polish.[31]

First Polish people in Lithuania were mainly enslaved war captives.[33] Poles started to migrate to the Grand Duchy in more noticeable numbers after Christianization of the country and establishment of the union between Poland and Lithuania in 1385.[34] In the 15th-16th centuries, there were not many Poles in Lithuania, but they enjoyed a privileged social status – they were found in highly regarded places and their culture was considered prestigious.[35] With time Polish people became part of the local landowning class.[36] Lithuanian nobles welcomed fugitive Polish peasants and settled them on uncultivated land, but they usually assimilated with Belarusians and Lithuanians peasants within few generations.[34] In the 16th century, the largest concentrations of Poles in Lithuania were located in Podlachia,[b] the border areas of Samogitia, Lithuania and Belarus, and the cities of Vilnius, Brest, Kaunas, Grodno, Kėdainiai, and Nyasvizh.[43] During that period, the royal and grand ducal courts were nearly entirely composed of Polish speakers.[44] Polish quickly supplanted Ruthenian as the language of Lithuanian elite after the latter had switched to speaking Ruthenian and Polish at the beginning of the 16th century.[35] Reformation gave another impetus to the spread of Polish, as the Bible and other religious texts were translated from Latin to Polish. Since the second half of the 16th century, Poles predominated in Protestant schools and printing houses in Lithuania, and the life of local protestant congregations.[45] There were also numerous Poles among the Jesuits residing in Lithuania.[46]

The influx of Poles to Lithuania significantly increased after the Union of Lublin.[47] This population movement created a fertile ground for socio-cultural Polonization of ethnically Lithuanian territories. While Poles and foreigners were generally prohibited from holding public offices in the Grand Duchy, Polish people gradually gained this right through the acquisition of Lithuanian land.[48] Poor nobles from the Crown rented land from local magnates.[49] The number of Poles grew also in the towns, among others in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Grodno.[50] Vilnius became the most important center of the Polish intelligentsia in the Grand Duchy,[51] with Poles predominating in the city in the mid-17th century.[52]

Already in the 16th century Polish became the first language of the Lithuanian magnates.[5] In the following centuries it was adopted by the Lithuanian nobility in general.[53][20] Even the Samogitian nobility used the Polish language already in the 17th century.[54] The Polish language also penetrated other social strata: the clergy, the townspeople, and even the peasants.[55] During the Commonwealth, a Polish-dominated territory started to be slowly formed in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,[34] such as Liauda, northeast of Kaunas (since the early 15th century).[citation needed] The Polish historian Władysław Wielhorski [pl] estimated that by the end of the 18th century, Polish and Polonized people constituted 25% of the Grand Duchy's inhabitants.[34]

Until the 1830s, Polish was the administrative language in the so called Western Krai, which included the territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that were annexed by the Russian Empire.[56] During the 19th century, Poles were the most numerous group among Vilnius' Christian inhabitants, and they also predominated in the municipal governing body in the early half of that century.[57] The Polish-language university was re-established in Vilnius in 1803 and closed in 1832.[58] After the 1863 uprising, public use of the Polish language and teaching it to peasants, as well as possession of Polish books by the latter became illegal.[59][60] Notwithstanding their varied ethnic roots, the members of szlachta generally opted for Polish self-identification in the course of the 19th century.[61]

In the 19th century, Polish culture spread among the lower classes of Lithuania,[62] mainly in Dzūkija and to a lesser degree in Aukštaitija. Linguists distinguish between official Polish language, used in the Church and cultural activities, and colloquial language, closer to the speech of the common people. Inhabitants of a significant part of the Vilnius region used a variant of the Belarusian language, which was influenced mainly by Polish, referred to as ""simple speech"" (Polish: mowa prosta). It was a kind of ""mixed language"" serving as an interdialect of the cultural borderland.[63] This language became a gateway to the progressive Slavization of the Lithuanian population. This led to the formation of a compact Polish language area between the Lithuanian and Belarusian language areas, with Vilnius as the center.[64] The position of Vilnius as an important Polish cultural center influenced the development of national identities among Roman Catholic peasants in the region.[65] The Lithuanian National Revival began in the 19th century as a self-defence reaction to the Polonization and by the 1880s started slowing down the process of Polonization of the ethnically Lithuanian population, but also cemented a sense of national identity among a significant portion of the Polish-speaking Lithuanian population. The feeling of a two-tier Lithuanian-Polish national identity, present throughout the period, had to give way to a clear national declaration.[citation needed]

From 1918 to 1921 there were several conflicts, such as the activity of the Polish Military Organisation, Sejny uprising and a foiled attempt at a Polish coup of the Lithuanian government.[66][67] The Polish–Lithuanian War and Żeligowski's mutiny led to such borders between Lithuania and Poland which resulted in many Poles living in the Lithuanian state and numerous Lithuanians outside of it. The loss of Vilnius was a painful blow to Lithuanian aspirations and identity, as most of the Vilnius region was part of the Second Polish Republic during the interwar period. The irredentist demand for its recovery became one of the most important elements of socio-political life in interwar Lithuania and resulted in the emergence of hostility and resentment against the Poles.[68]

In interwar Lithuania, people declaring Polish ethnicity were officially described as Polonized Lithuanians who needed to be re-Lithuanized, Polish-owned land was confiscated, Polish religious services, schools, publications and voting rights were restricted.[69] According to the 1923 Lithuanian census (without Vilnius and Klaipėda regions), there were 65,600 Poles in Lithuania (3.2% of the total population).[70] However, according to Polish Election Committee the number of Poles was actually 202,026, so about 10% of total population.[71] The Poles were concentrated in the districts of Kaunas, Kėdainiai, Kaišiadorys and Ukmergė, in each of which they constituted 20–30% of the population.[72] In 1919, Poles owned 90% of estates larger than 100 ha. By 1928, 2,997 large estates with a total area of 555,207 ha were parceled out, and 52,935 new farms were created in their place and given to Lithuanian peasants.[73]

Many Poles in Lithuania were signed in as Lithuanians in their passports, and as a result, they also were forced to attend Lithuanian schools.[citation needed] Polish education was organized by the Pochodnia.[citation needed] After the establishment of Valdemaras regime in 1926, 58[75] Polish schools were closed, many Poles were incarcerated, and Polish newspapers were placed under strict censorship.[76] Poles also had difficult access to higher education.[77] Over time, the Polish language was also removed from the Church and seminaries.[citation needed] The most tragic episode in the history of Poles in interwar Lithuania was an anti-Polish demonstration organized by the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union on May 23, 1930 in Kaunas, which turned into a riot.[78]

During the World War II expulsions and shortly after the war, the Soviet Union, forcibly exchanged population between Poland and Lithuania. During 1945–1948, the Soviet Union allowed 197,000 Poles to leave to Poland; in 1956–1959, another 46,600 were able to leave.[80][81] Ethnic Poles made up 80-91% of Vilnius population in 1944.[82][83] All Poles in the city were required to register for resettlement.[84] In most cases, the Soviet authorities blocked the departure of Poles who were interwar Lithuanian citizens and only 8.3% (less than 8,000) of those who registered for repatriation in Kaunas Region in 1945–1946 managed to leave for Poland.[85]

In the 1950s the remaining Polish minority was a target of several attempted campaigns of Lithuanization by the Communist Party of Lithuania, which tried to stop any teaching in Polish; those attempts, however, were stopped by Moscow.[86] The Soviet census of 1959 showed 230,100 Poles concentrated in the Vilnius region (8.5% of the Lithuanian SSR's population).[87] The Polish minority increased in size, but more slowly than other ethnic groups in Lithuania; the last Soviet census of 1989 showed 258,000 Poles (7.0% of the Lithuanian SSR's population).[87] The Polish minority, subject in the past to massive, often voluntary[88] Russification and Sovietization, and recently to voluntary processes of Lithuanization, shows many and increasing signs of assimilation with Lithuanians.[87]

When Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1990 large part of the Polish minority, still remembering the 1950s attempts to ban Polish,[86] was afraid that the independent Lithuanian government might want to reintroduce the Lithuanization policies. Furthermore, some Lithuanian nationalists, notably the Vilnija organization which was founded in 1988, considered eastern Lithuania's inhabitants as Polonized Lithuanians.[89] Due to their view of ethnicity as primordial, they argued that the Lithuanian state should work to restore their ""true"" identity.[89] Although, many Poles in Lithuania do have Lithuanian ancestry, they considered themselves ethnically Polish.[90]

According to the historian Alfred E. Senn, the Polish minority was divided into three main groups: Vilnius' inhabitants supported Lithuanian independence, the residents of Vilnius' southeastern districts and Šalčininkai were pro-Soviet, while the third group scattered throughout the country did not have a clear position.[91] According to surveys from the spring of 1990, 47% of Poles in Lithuania supported the pro-Soviet Communist party (in contrast to 8% support among ethnic Lithuanians), while 35% supported Lithuanian independence.[86]

In November 1988, Yedinstvo (literally ""Unity""), a pro-Soviet movement that opposed Lithuanian independence, was formed.[92] Under local Polish leadership and with Soviet support, the regional authorities in Vilnius and Šalčininkai region declared an autonomous region, the Polish National Territorial Region.[93] The same Polish politicians later voiced support for the Soviet coup attempt of 1991 in Moscow.[93]  Yedinstvo, which had never had the approval of the Polish government, collapsed after the failure of the GKChP in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which doomed any prospect of a return to Soviet rule.[92] Simultaneously, after the August Coup's failure, the Polish autonomous region was immediately declared illegal by the Lithuanian government, which instituted direct rule in those areas.[94][93]

In April 1989, another more moderate organization of Lithuanian Poles, the Association of Poles in Lithuania (Polish: Związek Polaków na Litwie, ZPL), was established. Its first leader was Jan Sienkiewicz.[95] ZPL supported the 1991 Lithuanian independence referendum. On 29 January 1991, Lithuanian government granted minorities right of schooling in their native language and use of it in official institutions.[96]

A new Citizenship Law was enacted in December 1991, that granted citizenship to every person that lived in eastern Lithuania before 1940, if they did not have citizenship of another country, thus excluding some persons that emigrated to Lithuania after the war.[97]

Such a situation caused tension in Polish–Lithuanian relations.[96] Direct rule was lifted and local elections were organised in December 1992.[98] The ZPL also strengthened its attitude, demanding that the Polish minority be granted a number of rights, such as the establishment of a Polish university, increasing the rights of the Polish language, increasing subsidies from the central budget, and others.[99] ZPL took part in the 1992 parliamentary elections winning 2.07% of the votes and four seats in Seimas.

In 1994, Lithuanian parliament limited participation in local elections to political parties, accordingly ZPL established Electoral Action for Lithuanian Poles (Polish: Akcja Wyborcza Polaków na Litwie, AWPL). In January 1995 a new Language Law was enacted which required representatives of local institutions to know Lithuanian language, also all secondary schools were required to teach Lithuanian.

Polish–Lithuanian relations eased only in 1994, when both countries signed a treaty of good neighborhood.[100] The treaty protected the rights of the Polish minority in Lithuania and the Lithuanian minority in Poland.[101] It also defined nationality as a matter of individual choice, which was contrary to the definition popular among Lithuanian nationalists, and even to the definition given in Lithuania's National Minorities Right Law of 1989, which defined nationality as something inherited. The Treaty defined that to the Polish ethnic minority belongs to persons who have Lithuanian citizenship, are of Polish origin or consider themselves to belong to the Polish nationality, culture and traditions as well as viewing the Polish language as their native language.[102]

The situation of the Polish minority assumed international significance again in 1995 after the publication of a Council of Europe report prepared by a commission headed by György Frunda (the so-called ""Frunda Report""), which criticized Lithuanian policy toward the Polish minority, particularly the lack of recognition of the Polish university.[103] However, this did not significantly affect Lithuanian politics. In 1996, the special provisions that made an entry of ethno-political parties parliament easier were removed, and from then on they had to meet the usual electoral threshold. The restoration of property lost during the communist period was also a burning issue, which was implemented very slowly in the lands inhabited by Poles. Poles protested against the expansion of Vilnius' borders.[104]

Tensions arose regarding Polish education and the spelling of names. The United States Department of State stated, in a report issued in 2001, that the Polish minority had issued complaints concerning its status in Lithuania, and that members of the Polish Parliament criticized the government of Lithuania over alleged discrimination against the Polish minority.[105] In 2006 Polish Foreign Minister Stefan Meller asserted that Polish educational institutions in Lithuania are severely underfunded.[106] Similar concerns were voiced in 2007 by a Polish parliamentary commission.[107] According to a report issued by the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency in 2004, Poles in Lithuania were the second least-educated minority group in Lithuania.[108] The branch of the University of Białystok in Vilnius educates mostly members of the Polish minority.

A report by the Council of Europe, issued in 2007, stated that on the whole, minorities were integrated quite well into the everyday life of Lithuania. The report expressed a concern with Lithuanian nationality law, which contains a right of return clause.[109] The citizenship law was under discussion during 2007; it was deemed unconstitutional on 13 November 2006.[110] A proposed constitutional amendment would allow the Polish minority in Lithuania to apply for Polish passports.[111]

Lithuanian constitutional law stipulated that everyone (not only Poles) who has Lithuanian citizenship and resides within the country has to write their name in the Lithuanian alphabet and according to the Lithuanian pronunciation; for example, the name Kleczkowski has to be spelled Klečkovski in official documents.[112][113][114][115] Poles who registered for Lithuanian citizenship after dissolution of the Soviet Union were forced to accept official documents with Lithuanian versions of their names.[116] On April 24, 2012 the European Parliament accepted for further consideration the petition (number 0358/2011) submitted by a Tomasz Snarski about the language rights of Polish minority, in particular about enforced Lithuanization of Polish surnames.[117][118]

Representatives of the Lithuanian government demanded removal of illegally placed Polish names of the streets in Maišiagala, Raudondvaris, Riešė and Sudervė as by a Lithuanian law, all the street name signs must be in a state language.[119][120] as by constitutional law all names have to be in Lithuanian. Tensions have been reported between the Lithuanian Roman Catholic clergy and its Polish parishioniers in Lithuania.[121][122][123] The Seimas voted against foreign surnames in Lithuanian passports.[124]

In late May 2008, the Association of Poles in Lithuania issued a letter, addressed to Lithuania's government, complaining about anti-minority (primarily, anti-Polish) rhetoric in media, citing upcoming parliamentary elections as a motive, and asking for better treatment of the ethnic minorities. The association also filed a complaint with the Lithuanian prosecutor, asking for investigation of the issue.[125][126][127]

The Law on Ethnic Minorities lapsed in 2010.[128] As of 2023 Lithuania has not ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.[129]

There are opinions[by whom?] in some Polish media that the Polish minority in Lithuania is facing discrimination. As mentioned above, Petition 0358/2011 on language rights of Poles living in Lithuania was filed with the European Parliament in 2011.[130] Polish Election Action in Lithuania claimed that the education legislation is discriminatory.[131] In 2011, former Polish President Lech Wałęsa criticized the government of Lithuania over its alleged discrimination against the Polish minority.[132]

Until 2022 Lithuania continued to enforce the Lithuanized[clarification needed] spelling of surnames of Poles in Lithuania, with some exceptions, in spite of the 1994 Polish–Lithuanian agreement,[133] Lithuanian legislative system and the Constitution, see section ""Surnames"" for details.

Until 2010, Lithuanian-Polish bilingual street signs were considered legal in Lithuania if placed in the areas with significant Polish populations.[134] However, the Law on National Minorities, which guaranteed this, was discontinued. As a result, such signs are now prohibited and Lithuanian courts enforce their removal under the threat of fines.[134][135][136] The refusal of Lithuanian authorities to install or allow bilingual road signs (against the legislative base of Lithuania) in areas densely populated by Lithuanian Poles is at times described by the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania and some Polish media as linguistic discrimination.[131][135]

The official spelling of the all non-Lithuanian (hence Polish) name in a person's passport is governed by the 31 January 1991 Resolution of the Supreme Council of Lithuania No. I-1031 ""Concerning name and surname spelling in the passport of the citizen of the Republic of Lithuania"". There are the following options. The law says, in part:[137]

2. In the passport of a citizen of the Republic of Lithuania, the first name and surname of persons of non-Lithuanian origin shall be spelt in Lithuanian. On the citizen's request in writing, the name and surname can be spelt in the order established as follows:

a) according to pronunciation and without grammatisation (i.e. without Lithuanian endings) or

b) according to pronunciation alongside grammatisation (i.e. adding Lithuanian endings).

3. The names and surnames of the persons, who have already possessed citizenship of other State, shall be written according to the passport of the State or an equivalent document available in the passport of the Republic of Lithuania on its issue.

This resolution was challenged in 1999 in the Constitutional Court upon a civil case of a person of Polish ethnicity who requested his name to be entered in the passport in Polish. The Constitutional Court upheld the 1991 resolution. At the same time, it was stressed out citizen's rights to spell their name whatever they like in areas ""not linked with the sphere of use of the state language pointed out in the law"".[138]

In 2022, the Seimas passed a law allowing members of ethnic minorities to use the full Latin alphabet, including q, w and x, letters which are not considered part of the Lithuanian alphabet, but not characters with diacritics (such as ł and ä), in their legal name if they declare their status as an ethnic minority and prove that their ancestors used that name. In response, several ethnically Polish Lithuanian politicians changed their legal names to be closer to the Polish spelling, most notably Justice Minister Ewelina Dobrowolska (formerly spelled ""Evelina Dobrovolska""), but requests for name changes from the general population were low.[139][140] From May 2022 when law came into action until the end of July 2023 only 337 people changed their names to include non-Lithuanian language symbols and only less than 5 of those declared to be of Polish descent.[141] By the end of August 2023 the number of people of Polish descent that changed their names to include non-Lithuanian symbols increased to 203 which was approximately 0.11% of all Poles in Lithuania.[142]

The Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance is an ethnic minority-based political party formed in 1994, able to exert significant political influence in the administrative districts where Poles form a majority or significant minority. This party has held seats in the Seimas (Parliament of Lithuania) for the past decade. In the 2020 and 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary elections it received just below 4.97% and 3.88% of the national vote, respectively. The party is more active in local politics and controls several municipal councils.[143] It cooperates with other minorities, mainly the Lithuanian Russian Union.

The Union of Poles in Lithuania is an organization formed in 1989 to bring together Polish activists in Lithuania. It numbers between 6,000 and 11,000 members. Its work concerns the civil rights of the Polish minority and engages in educational, cultural, and economic activities.[144]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_in_Lithuania
Lithuania–Russia relations,"Lithuania–Russia relations or the Russo-Lithuanian relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Lithuania and the Russian Federation. They have been marked by a long and turbulent history dating back to the Middle Ages. The modern-day relations have been mostly hostile. The two countries share a common border through Kaliningrad Oblast. Lithuania has an embassy in Moscow with consulates in Kaliningrad and in Sovetsk, whereas Russia has an embassy in Vilnius.

Despite today's difference in population and area between the countries, Lithuania (also as part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and Russia (including its predecessor Principality of Moscow) were more equal regional powers in the past, competing for supremacy in Eastern Europe. The two states fought numerous wars, with Lithuania controlling sizeable parts of modern-day Russia in the Late Middle Ages, and Russia controlling the bulk of Lithuania in the late modern period.

In response to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Bucha massacre, in April 2022, Lithuania downgraded the diplomatic relations and expelled the Russian ambassador.[1] As of 2022, the relations between the countries have been reduced to the bare minimum.[2]

The origins of the relations between contemporary Lithuania and Russia can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania came into contact with the Principality of Moscow.[3] The rivalry between the Lithuanian dukes and Muscovite princes began in the first half of the 14th century and soon resulted in Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–1372).[4]
In this conflict, the Principality of Tver sided with Lithuania.[4] The conflict resumed again in the 15th century, as the rulers of both powers had aspirations to seize the territories of the former Kievan Rus', resulting in a number of campaigns, territorial changes, complex alliances and regional rulers changing sides.[4] On 31 August 1449, Casimir IV Jagiellon and Vasily II of Moscow signed the first treaty between Lithuania and Muscovy, referred to as the Treaty of Eternal Peace (1449).[5] The wars continued in 1487–1494, 1500–1503 and 1512–1522 with a number of truce and peace treaties signed in this period.[5] In the early 16th century, Lithuania lost the eastern cities of Bryansk, Kursk and Smolensk to Muscovy.

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania co-formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Ivan IV seized the territories in the north and, in 1547, consolidated them under the Tsardom of Russia. Both states continued to have wars, either directly or within alliances, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Following the Great Northern War, which involved many European powers, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth began to decline and was eventually partitioned by the neighbouring powers. After the third partition in 1795, the bulk of the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was taken over by the Russian Empire.[6] The new provinces were often called ""Lithuanian"", but in 1840, Nicholas I prohibited the use of the name.[7] There were two major rebellions against the Russian rule, the November Uprising of 1830 and the January Uprising of 1863, but they failed to restore the Polish–Lithuanian state.[8][9]

During the 1905 Russian Revolution, a large congress of Lithuanian representatives in the Great Seimas of Vilnius demanded a wide political autonomy for Lithuania (by which they meant the northwestern portion of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania)[10] on 5 December of that year. The tsarist regime made a number of concessions as the result of the 1905 uprising. The Baltic states once again were permitted to use their native languages in schooling and public discourse, and Catholic churches were again built in Lithuania. Latin alphabet was restored after a period of the Lithuanian press ban. However, even Russian liberals were not prepared to concede autonomy similar to the degree it already existed in Estonia and Latvia, albeit under Baltic German hegemony. Many Baltic Germans looked toward aligning the Baltics (Lithuania and Courland in particular) with Germany.[11]

After the outbreak of hostilities in World War I, Germany occupied Lithuania and Courland in 1915. Vilnius fell to the Germans on 19 September 1915 and Lithuania was incorporated into Ober Ost under a German government of occupation.[12] As open annexation could result in a public-relations backlash, the Germans planned to form a network of formally independent states that would in fact be dependent on Germany.[13] However, the defeat of Germany in World War I and the October Revolution in Russia created an opportunity for the Lithuanian leaders to organize the Vilnius Conference and begin the process of reestablishing a fully independent Lithuanian state.[14] On 18 February 1918, the Council of Lithuania signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania, proclaiming the Republic of Lithuania.

During the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–19, which followed the retreating German troops, a Lithuanian–Soviet War was fought between the newly independent Lithuania and the Soviet Russia. At the same time, the Soviet Russia created short-lived puppet states: Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic which was soon merged into the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, the Soviet military campaign was unsuccessful and the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed on 12 July 1920. In the treaty, the Soviet Russia recognized fully independent Lithuania, including its claims to the disputed Vilnius Region.[15]

Following the peace treaty with Soviet Russia, Lithuania secretly allowed the Soviet forces a passage through its territory as they moved against Poland.[15] On 14 July 1920, the advancing Soviet army captured Vilnius and returned it to Lithuanians, but on 26 August 1920 the city was again captured by the Polish army which defeated the Soviets. To prevent further fighting, the Suwałki Agreement was signed by Poland and Lithuania on 7 October 1920; it left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side of the armistice line.[16] It never went into effect, however, because Polish General Lucjan Żeligowski, acting on Józef Piłsudski's orders, staged the Żeligowski's Mutiny: a military offensive presented as a mutiny.[16] He invaded Lithuania on 8 October 1920, captured Vilnius the following day, and established a short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania in eastern Lithuania on 12 October 1920. The ""Republic"" was a part of Piłsudski's federalist scheme, which never materialized due to opposition from both the Polish and Lithuanian nationalists.[16]

On 30 December 1922, Soviet Russia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and the latter state inherited the Lithuania–Russia relations.

The Third Seimas of Lithuania was elected in May 1926. For the first time, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party lost their majority and went into opposition. It was sharply criticized for signing the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact, even though it affirmed Soviet recognition of Lithuanian claims to Poland-held Vilnius.[17]

At the beginning of World War II, when the Soviet Union invaded Poland, Soviet troops took over Vilnius Region. The region belonged to Interwar Poland, but according to the 1920 Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and later treaties it was recognized to Lithuania.[18] As a result, Soviets and Germans re-negotiated the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On 28 September 1939, they signed the Boundary and Friendship Treaty.[19] Its secret attachment detailed that to compensate the Soviet Union for German-occupied Polish territories, Germany would transfer Lithuania, except for a small territory in Suvalkija, to the Soviet sphere of influence.[20] The exchange of territories was also motivated by Soviet control of Vilnius: the Soviet Union could exert significant influence on the Lithuanian government, which claimed Vilnius to be its de jure capital.[21] In the secret protocols, both Soviet Union and Germany explicitly recognized Lithuanian interest in Vilnius.[22] Accordingly, by the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of 10 October 1939, Lithuania would acquire about one fifth of the Vilnius Region, including Lithuania's historical capital, Vilnius, and in exchange would allow five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops to be established across Lithuania.[citation needed]

After months of intense propaganda and diplomatic pressure, the Soviets issued an ultimatum on 14 June 1940.[23] Soviets accused Lithuania of violating the treaty and abducting Russian soldiers from their bases.[20] Soviets demanded that a new government, which would comply with the Mutual Assistance Treaty, would be formed and that an unspecified number of Soviet troops would be admitted to Lithuania.[24] With Soviet troops already in the country, it was impossible to mount military resistance.[23] Soviets took control of government institutions, installed a new pro-Soviet puppet government, and announced elections to the People's Seimas. Following the sham election, the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the Soviet Union on 3 August 1940.[25] One local Communist party emerged from underground with 1500 members in Lithuania.[26]

In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army reached eastern Lithuania.[27] By July 1944, the area around Vilnius came under control of the Polish Resistance fighters of the Armia Krajowa, who also attempted a takeover of the German-held city during the ill-fated Operation Ostra Brama.[28] The Red Army captured Vilnius with Polish help on 13 July.[28] The Soviet Union re-occupied Lithuania and Joseph Stalin re-established the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1944 with its capital in Vilnius.[28] The Soviets secured the passive agreement of the United States and Great Britain (see Yalta Conference and Potsdam Agreement) to this annexation. By January 1945, the Soviet forces captured Klaipėda on the Baltic coast. The heaviest physical losses in Lithuania during World War II were suffered in 1944–45, when the Red Army pushed out the Nazi invaders.[29] It is estimated that Lithuania lost 780,000 people between 1940 and 1954 under the Nazi and Soviet occupations.[30]

After Stalin's death in 1953, the deportees were slowly and gradually released. The last deportees were released only in 1963. Some 60,000 managed to return to Lithuania, while 30,000 were prohibited from settling back in their homeland. Soviet authorities encouraged the immigration of non-Lithuanian workers, especially Russians, as a way of integrating Lithuania into the Soviet Union and encouraging industrial development,[30] but in Lithuania this process did not assume the massive scale experienced by other European Soviet republics.[31]

As allies of the Soviet Union during World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom recognized the occupation of the Republic of Lithuania at Yalta Conference in 1945 de facto. However, the US, UK her Western governments did not recognize the seizure of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in 1940 and in 1944 de jure according to the Welles Declaration of 23 July 1940.[32] As a result of this doctrine, most Western countries continue to recognize Lithuania as an independent, sovereign de jure state subject to international law represented by the legations appointed by the pre-1940 state which functioned through the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service.

During the occupation of Lithuania, at least 130,000 people, 70% of them women and children,[33] were forcibly transported to labor camps and other forced settlements in remote parts of the Soviet Union, such as the Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Krai. Among the deportees were about 4,500 Poles.[34] These deportations did not include Lithuanian partisans or political prisoners (approximately 150,000 people) deported to Gulag forced labor camps.[35] Deportations of the civilians served a double purpose: repressing resistance to Sovietization policies in Lithuania and providing free labor in sparsely inhabited areas of the Soviet Union. Approximately 28,000 of Lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions.[citation needed]

In 1956 and 1957, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved releases of larger groups of the deportees, including the Lithuanians. Deportees started returning in large numbers creating difficulties for local communists – deportees would petition for return of their confiscated property, were generally considered unreliable and required special surveillance. Soviet Lithuanian officials, including Antanas Sniečkus, drafted local administrative measures prohibiting deportee return and petitioned Moscow to enact national policies to that effect.[36] In May 1958, the Soviet Union revised its policy regarding the remaining deportees: all those who were not involved with the Lithuanian partisans were released, but without the right to return to Lithuania.[37] The last Lithuanians—the partisan relatives and the partisans—were released only in 1960 and 1963 respectively.[38] Majority of the deportees released in May 1958 and later never returned to Lithuania.[39]

About 60,000 deportees returned to Lithuania.[40] Upon return, they faced further difficulties: their property was long looted and divided up by strangers, they faced discrimination for jobs and social guarantees, their children were denied higher education. Former deportees, resistance members, and their children were not allowed to integrate into the society. That created a permanent group of people that opposed the regime and continued non-violent resistance.[41]

Lithuania declared sovereignty on its territory on 18 May 1989 and restored independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990 as the Republic of Lithuania. It was the first Soviet republic to do so. All legal ties of the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the republic were cut as Lithuania declared the restitution of its independence. The Soviet Union claimed that this declaration was illegal, suggesting that Lithuania had to follow the process of secession mandated in the Soviet Constitution. Lithuania claimed that the Soviet annexation itself was illegal and claimed state continuity. In January 1991, during the January Events, Soviet military attempted to crack down on the Lithuanian independence, killing 14 civilians and injuring over 140.[42][43] 14 civilians were killed and over 140 were injured.[44] Following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, most countries recognized the Lithuanian independence, and the Soviet Union itself did that on 6 September 1991.

On 27 July 1991, the Russian government re-recognized Lithuania and the two countries re-established diplomatic relations on 9 October 1991. President Boris Yeltsin and the Chairman of the Supreme Council Vytautas Landsbergis met to discuss economic ties. The Russian troops stayed in Lithuania for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993.[citation needed] Since the reestablishment of independence, only two Lithuanian leaders have visited Moscow: one by Algirdas Brazauskas in 1997 and Valdas Adamkus in 2001 and 2005.[45][46][47] A planned 1999 trip to Moscow was reportedly canceled due to Boris Yeltsin's illness.[48] The first telephone conversation took place between Dalia Grybauskaitė and Dmitry Medvedev in 2009.[49]

Following Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, concerns about the geopolitical environment led Lithuania to begin preparing for a possibility of a military conflict with Russia. In December 2014, Russia carried out a military drill in nearby Kaliningrad with 55 naval vessels and 9,000 soldiers.[50] In 2015, Lithuanian Chief of Defence Jonas Vytautas Žukas announced plans to reinstate conscription, which had previously ended in 2008, to bolster the ranks of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The plan succeeded, while the vast majority are voluntary, with only about 10% by today (as of late 2010s) being drawn from compulsory conscription involuntarily. [51] The Ministry of National Defence also published a 98-page manual for citizens to prepare them for a possibility of armed conflict or occupation.[52] In 2017, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence was deployed to Lithuania and other NATO members in the eastern flank.[53]

Following the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania has strongly condemned the invasion and called for military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.[54] President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda declared a state of emergency on 24 February 2022. On the same day, Lithuania also requested NATO to activate the Article 4 on joint consultations.[55]

Together with the other EU member states, Lithuania banned Russian language media channels and imposed sanctions on Russia, and Russia, in turn, added all EU countries to the list of ""unfriendly nations"".[56] Soon after Lithuania expelled four Russian diplomats.[57] On 4 April, in response to the Bucha massacre, Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and closed the consulate in Klaipėda.[1] In April 2022, the Russian government decided to withdraw its consent to the functioning of the Consulate-General of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg.[58]

On 10 May, Lithuania's Seimas voted unanimously to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine as constituting terrorism and genocide. The motion described Russia's war crimes in Ukraine as including ""deliberate killing of civilians, mass rape, forcible relocation of Ukrainian citizens to Russia and the destruction of economic infrastructure and cultural sites"". The motion claimed that Russian forces were targeting Ukrainian civilian sites for bombing and described Russia as a state which ""supports and perpetrates terrorism"".[59] In response to the resolution, Leonid Slutsky stated that the resolution was part of an ""anti-Russia project"", accused Lithuania of Russophobia and said that ""the level of relations with Lithuania has already been lowered significantly"".[60]

On 8 June 2022 Russian parliamentarian Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov submitted a bill to the Duma to repeal the recognition by the Russian state of Lithuania's independence.[61] He thought that in this way the other two Baltic states might have their independence reversed too. An academic from the Institute of Commonwealth of Independent States brought up several expansionist devices and suggested that the Baltic States were ""making the same mistake as Ukraine, which believed that the Russian Federation would never send troops because the United States was behind it.""[62] Towards the end of June, Lithuania announced that it would be blocking the transport of Russian goods through their territory from mainland Russia to Kaliningrad. Russia criticised Lithuania for this.[63]

In September 2022, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have decided to close entry for the Russian citizens with Schengen visas, including those issued by third countries.[64] In 2022, around 4,000 Russian citizens applied for a residence permit in Lithuania, while 38 had their permanent residence permit revoked over security concerns.[65]

In December 2022, diplomatic relations between Lithuania and Russia were downgraded to the level of acting chargé d'affaires after the Russian ambassador was expelled and the Lithuanian ambassador recalled.[66]

In August 2023, following a survey, Lithuania announced that 254 Russian and 910 Belarusian citizens living in Lithuania posed a threat to national security and that their residence permits will be revoked.[67][68]

In September 2023, following the new explanation of the EU sanctions by the European Commission, Lithuania together with the other Baltic States and Finland banned the vehicles with the Russian license plates from entering their territory.[69][70]

In October 2024, Lithuania denounced several treaties with Russia and Belarus, including a treaty on double taxation of income and a treaty on legal assistance.[71]

In 2021 Russia exported $4.56 billion of goods to Lithuania with crude oil, the main product. Exports from Lithuania were $4.14 billion with wine being the top product. From 1995 to 2021 Russian exports have risen by 6.04% p.a. with Lithuanian exports rising at 8.06% on average.[72]

Lithuanian calendar,"The Lithuanian calendar is unusual among Western countries in that neither the names of the months nor the names of the weekdays are derived from Greek or Norse mythology. They were formalized after Lithuania regained independence in 1918, based on historic names, and celebrate natural phenomena; three months are named for birds, two for trees, and the remainder for seasonal activities and features. The days of the week are simply ordinal numbers. The Lithuanian calendar shows some similarities with the Slavic calendars.

Lithuanian researcher Libertas Klimka [lt] proposed that there was a simple astronomical observatory on the Birutė Hill in Palanga before the Christianization of Lithuania.[1]

The so-called Sceptre of Gediminas cause much speculation about a medieval Lithuanian calendar. It was found on the shore of the Strėva River near Kietaviškės [lt] in 1680. It was an iron stick 68.6 centimetres (27.0 in) in length covered in brass tin with small golden nails that formed various symbols grouped in a spiral of 39 rows. The original was lost at the end of the 19th century, but copies were made and one is kept at the National Museum of Lithuania. A copy owned by the historian Teodor Narbutt was studied and described by the Russian astronomer Matvey Gusev who argued that the symbols marked lunar months and days. No similar artifacts have been found since and researchers doubt its authenticity.[2][3]

The Julian calendar was used in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; the Gregorian calendar was adopted by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1586, a few years after its promulgation in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. In 1800, following Lithuania's annexation by the Russian Empire, the Julian calendar again became the norm, although a part of ethnic Lithuania left of Nemunas River (Suvalkija) retained the Gregorian calendar (see Aleksotas).[4] The Russian Revolution of 1917 re-instated the Gregorian calendar, which had been the Western European standard for over a century, in January 1918. These changes caused some confusion before their usage became familiar.[5]

The standardization of month names was made difficult by the fact that publication of the Lithuanian language in Latin script was illegal from 1864 to 1904 (see Lithuanian press ban) and some drift in the usages occurred.

Month names are not capitalized in the Lithuanian language, reflecting their secular origins.

The days of the week are named in sequence, beginning with Monday. They are pirmadienis (""first day""), antradienis, trečiadienis, ketvirtadienis, penktadienis, šeštadienis, and sekmadienis. They are not capitalized.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_calendar
Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars,"The Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars (also known as the Russo-Lithuanian Wars or simply Muscovite Wars or Lithuanian Wars)[nb 1] were a series of wars between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (in the later wars allied with the Kingdom of Poland) and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which was later unified with other Russian principalities to eventually become the Tsardom of Russia. After several defeats at the hands of Ivan III and Vasily III, the Lithuanians were increasingly reliant on Polish aid, which eventually became an important factor in the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Before the first series of wars in the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania controlled vast stretches of Eastern European land, from Kiev to Mozhaysk, following the collapse of Kievan Rus' after the Mongol invasions. Over the course of the wars, particularly in the 16th century, the Muscovites expanded their domain westwards, taking control of many principalities.[1][2]

Alexandr Nevsky, the Prince of Novgorod, decided to go on a campaign after the Lithuanians attacked the border area and robbed many locals. He headed to Lithuania, where he freed all the prisoners and defeated the Lithuanians at Lake Zizicekoe. On the way back, the Lithuanians tried to take revenge, but were destroyed again.[3]

The Grand Duchy of Moscow and Lithuania had fought each other since the reign of Gediminas, who defeated a coalition of Ruthenian princes in the Battle on the Irpin River and seized Kiev, the former capital of Kievan Rus'. By the mid-14th century, an expanding Lithuania had absorbed Chernigov and Severia. Algirdas, the successor of Gediminas, allied with the Principality of Tver and undertook three expeditions against Moscow, attempting to take advantage of the youth of the Grand Prince of Moscow, Dmitry Ivanovich, who nevertheless succeeded in fending off these encroachments.[citation needed]

The first intrusions of Lithuanian troops into the Moscow principality occurred in 1363. In 1368, Algirdas carried out the first major expedition against Moscow. Having devastated the Muscovite borderland, the Lithuanian prince routed the troops of the Prince of Starodub [ru] Simeon Dmitrievich Krapiva and Prince of Obolensk [ru] Konstantin Yurievich [ru]. On November 21, Algirdas routed the Moscow sentry troops on the river Trosna. However, he could not seize the Moscow Kremlin. The troops of Algirdas ruined the area around the city and captured a significant portion of the Muscovite population. In 1370, Algirdas made another expedition against Moscow. He ruined the area around Volok Lamskiy. On December 6, he besieged Moscow and started to devastate the surrounding area. Having received the message that Prince Vladimir Andreevich was coming to help Moscow, Algirdas returned to Lithuania. In 1372 Algirdas attacked the Moscow principality again and reached Lyubutsk. However, the Grand Prince of Moscow Dmitry Ivanovich routed the sentry troops of Algirdas, and the Lithuanians concluded an armistice with Moscow. In 1375, Algirdas devastated the Smolensk principality.[4]

Some Muscovite elements wished to take over all of the land that was formerly of the Kievan Rus', most of which was now in the Lithuanian state. Furthermore, Moscow sought to expand its access to the Baltic Sea, an increasingly important trade route. Thus, the conflict between Lithuania and Moscow was only just beginning.[5][6]

Conflicts resumed during the reign of Dmitry's son Vasily I, who was married to Sophia, the sole daughter of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas the Great. In 1394, Vytautas devastated the Principality of Ryazan, leaving many settlements in ashes. In 1402, he quarrelled with his son-in-law over control of the Principality of Smolensk. After Vytautas captured his capital, Yury of Smolensk fled to Vasily's court and tried to enlist his assistance in regaining Smolensk. Vasily hesitated until Vytautas advanced on Pskov. Alarmed by Lithuania's continuing expansion, Vasily sent an army to aid the Pskovians against his father-in-law. The Russian and Lithuanian armies met near the Ugra River, but neither commander ventured to commit his troops to battle. A peace ensued, whereby Vytautas kept Smolensk.

Ivan III considered himself an heir to the fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Russia,[7] and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'.[8] Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The supremacy of the Golden Horde, known as the ""Mongol Yoke,"" ended in 1480 with the defeat of Ahmed Khan bin Küchük in the Great Stand on the Ugra River. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and annexed the Principality of Tver in 1483.[9] Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests.

Around 1486–1487, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian–Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Moscow[9] and its ally Meñli I Giray, Khan of Crimea.[10] Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk;[11] raided Mosalsk; and attacked the territory of the Dukes of Vyazma.[12] Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians. Ivan III officially declared war in 1493, but the conflict soon ended.[12] Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate a peace treaty. An ""eternal"" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494. The agreement marked the first Lithuanian territorial losses to Moscow: the Principality of Vyazma and a sizable region in the upper reaches of the Oka River.[8] The lost area was estimated to be approximately 87,000 km2 (34,000 sq mi).[13] A day before the treaty's official confirmation, Alexander Jagiellon was betrothed to Helena, daughter of Ivan III (the role of the groom was performed by Stanislovas Kęsgaila as Alexander was in Poland).[14]

Hostilities were renewed in May 1500,[15] when Ivan III took advantage of a planned Polish–Hungarian campaign against the Ottoman Empire:[8] While preoccupied with the Ottomans, Poland and Hungary would not assist Lithuania. The pretext was the alleged religious intolerance toward the Orthodox in the Lithuanian court. Helena was forbidden by her father Ivan III to convert to Catholicism, which provided numerous opportunities for Ivan III, as the defender of all Orthodox, to interfere in Lithuanian affairs and rally Orthodox believers.[8]

The Muscovites promptly overran Lithuanian fortresses in Bryansk, Vyazma,[15] Dorogobuzh, Toropets, and Putivl.[16] Local nobles, particularly the Vorotynskys, often joined the Muscovite cause. Another attack came from the southeast into Kiev Voivodeship, Volhynia, and Podolia.[14] On July 14, 1500, the Lithuanians suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha, and the Lithuanian Grand Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski was captured. The defeat was one of the reasons for the proposed Union of Mielnik between Poland and Lithuania.[17] In November 1501, the Lithuanians were defeated again in the Battle of Mstislavl. The Crimean Tatars destroyed the Golden Horde, a Lithuanian ally, when its capital New Sarai was conquered in 1502.[18]

In June 1501, John I Albert, King of Poland, died leaving his brother Alexander Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania, the strongest candidate for the Polish throne. Alexander became preoccupied with the succession.[19] To counter religious accusations, Alexander attempted to establish a church union between Catholics and Orthodox as it was envisioned at the Council of Florence – the Orthodox would retain their traditions but would accept the pope as their spiritual sovereign.[20] The Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus' agreed to such an arrangement, but Helena protested. Polish nobles, including Bishop Erazm Ciołek and Cardinal Frederick Jagiellon, discussed the issue of royal divorce.[21]

In the meantime, the war continued, just not as successfully for Moscow. As Lithuanian forces arrived in the region, the Muscovite forces had to move slowly. Additionally, the Livonian Order, led by Wolter von Plettenberg, joined the war as a Lithuanian ally.[16] The Livonian troops won the Battle of the Siritsa River in August 1501, besieged Pskov, and won the Battle of Lake Smolino in September 1502. In 1502, Ivan III organized a campaign to capture Smolensk, but the city withstood the siege as Muscovites chose a poor strategy and had insufficient artillery.[16] Peace negotiations began in mid-1502. Alexander asked Vladislaus II of Hungary to act as the mediator, and a six-year truce was concluded on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1503.[22] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost approximately 210,000 square kilometres (81,000 sq mi),[13] or a third of its territory: Chernigov, Novgorod-Seversk, Starodub, and lands around the upper Oka River.[8] Russian historian Matvei Kuzmich Liubavskii counted Lithuanian losses at 70 volosts, 22 towns, and 13 villages.[23] The Lithuanians also acknowledged Ivan's title, sovereign of all Russia.[10][7]

Historian Edvardas Gudavičius said: ""The war of 1492–1494 was a kind of reconnaissance mission conducted by the united Russia. [The terms of] the ceasefire of 1503 showed the planned political aggression of Russia, its undoubted military superiority. The concept of the sovereign of all Russia, put forward by Ivan III, did not leave room for the existence of the Lithuanian state"".[7]

During the Muscovite–Lithuanian War of 1503, the Crimean Tatar armies pillaged the Lithuania's southern towns of Slutsk, Kletsk, and Nyasvizh and even threatened the capital city of Vilnius. Alexander Jagiellon then ordered the construction of a defensive wall around his capital, which was completed in 1522.[24]

In 1506, Alexander died. Vasili III, who succeeded his father Ivan III in 1505, advanced his bid for the Polish throne,[25] but Polish nobles chose Sigismund I the Old, who was crowned both as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1507, Sigismund I sent envoys to Moscow to request the return of the territories acquired by the 1503 truce.[26] At the same time, Khan Meñli I Giray broke off his alliance with Moscow due to its campaign against Kazan.[25] Sigismund I received an yarlıq for the Muscovite territories of Novgorod, Pskov, and Ryazan.[25]

The war was intertwined with a rebellion by Michael Glinski, Court Marshal of Lithuania, a favorite of Alexander Jagiellon and a man of opportunity.[27] When Sigismund I the Old succeeded Alexander in 1506, he did not show the same favors to Glinski. Jan Zabrzeziński, Voivode of Trakai and Glinki's old political opponent, accused Glinski of treason – he alleged that Glinski poisoned Grand Duke Alexander and had ambitions of becoming king himself.[28] Glinski then organized a rebellion, murdered Zabrzeziński in February 1508, and declared himself the defender of the Orthodox faith (even though he was a Catholic of Mongol descent).[28] His followers unsuccessfully attacked the Kaunas Castle in an attempt to liberate the prisoner Ahmad, Khan of the Great Horde.[29] Glinski then established himself in Turov and contacted Vasili III. Glinski started retreating towards Moscow and attempted to capture Minsk, Slutsk, Mstsislaw, and Krychaw. He only managed to take Mazyr when his relative opened the gates.[29] Near Orsha, he joined with Muscovite forces but was defeated by Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski.[30] This series of defeats demonstrated the rebellion, despite its claims to protect the rights of the Orthodox, was not supported by the general population and did not spread.[29] The war eventually ended with the inconclusive 'eternal peace treaty' on October 8, 1508, which maintained the territorial accords of the 1503 truce.[31]

Despite the peace treaty, the relationship between the two countries remained tense. Sigismund I demanded Michael Glinski's extradition for trial, while Vasili III demanded better treatment of his widowed sister Helena.[32] Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was paying Khan Meñli I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[33] At the same time, Albert of Prussia became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and was unwilling to acknowledge Poland's suzerainty as required by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466).[34] The tension eventually resulted in the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521) and allied Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor with Vasili III.[33]

In December 1512, Moscow invaded the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture Smolensk, a major trading center.[35] Their first six- and four-week sieges in 1513 failed,[36] but the city fell in July 1514.[37] Prince Vasily Nemoy Shuysky was left as viceregent in Smolensk.[37] This angered Glinski, who threatened to rejoin Sigismund I but was imprisoned by the Russians.[38]

Russia then suffered a series of defeats in the field. In 1512, Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Konstanty Ostrogski, ravaged Severia and defeated a 6,000-strong Russian force. On 8 September 1514, the Russians suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Orsha.[39] Despite their victory, his army was unable to move quickly enough to recapture Smolensk.[40] In 1518, Russian forces were beaten during the siege of Polotsk,[41] when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their patron saint, Saint Casimir. The Russians invaded Lithuania again in 1519, raiding Orsha, Mogilev, Minsk, Vitebsk, and Polotsk.[42]

By 1521, Sigismund had defeated the Grand Master and allied with the Kazan and Crimean Tatar hordes against Moscow.[43] Khan of Crimea, Mehmed I Giray carried out a ruinous attack on the Moscow principality, resulting in a commitment from the grand prince to pay tribute.[44] The Lithuanian troops led by Dashkovich participated in the attack and tried to take Ryazan.[45]

In 1522, a treaty was signed that called for a five-year truce, no prisoner exchange, and for Russia to retain control of Smolensk.[46] The truce was subsequently extended to 1534.[47]

Upon Vasily's death in 1533, his son and heir, Ivan IV, was only three years old. His mother, Elena Glinskaya, acted as the regent and engaged in power struggles with other relatives and boyars.[48] The Polish–Lithuanian monarch decided to take advantage of the situation and demanded the return of territories conquered by Vasily III.[49] In the summer of 1534, Grand Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł and the Tatars devastated the area around Chernigov, Novgorod Seversk, Radogoshch, Starodub, and Briansk.[43] In October 1534, a Muscovite army under the command of Prince Ovchina-Telepnev-Obolensky, Prince Nikita Obolensky, and Prince Vasily Shuisky invaded Lithuania, advancing as far as Vilnius and Naugardukas, and built a fortress on Lake Sebezh the following year, before being stopped.[50] The Lithuanian army under Hetman Radziwill, Andrei Nemirovich, Polish Hetman Jan Tarnowski, and Semen Belsky launched a powerful counterattack and took Gomel and Starodub.[51]

In 1536, the fortress Sebezh defeated Nemirovich's Lithuanian forces when they tried to besiege it, and then the Muscovites attacked Liubech, razed Vitebsk, and built fortresses at Velizh and Zavoloche.[51] Lithuania and Russia negotiated a five-year truce, without prisoner exchange, in which Homel stayed under the king's control, while Moscow kept Sebezh and Zavoloche.[52]

In 1547, the Tsardom of Russia was officially proclaimed when Ivan IV was crowned as tsar of all Russia. The tsar sought to gather the ethnically Ruthenian lands of the former Kievan Rus', engaging with other powers around the Baltic Sea in the Livonian War.

During the reign of Sigismund II Augustus in Poland and Lithuania, Tsar Ivan IV invaded Livonia, first in 1558 when the Livonian Knights sought an alliance with Poland and Lithuania; the Poles and Lithuanians were able to defend only southern Livonia. Lithuania and Poland were initially allied with Denmark and fought against the Tsardom of Russia allied with Sweden; after several years the coalitions changed and Poland–Lithuania allied themselves with Sweden against Russia and Denmark. Eventually, the 1570 ceasefire divided Livonia between the participants, with Lithuania controlling Riga and Russians expanding access to the Baltic Sea by taking hold of Narva.

The Lithuanians felt increasingly pressured by the Tsar; further, Lithuanian lesser nobility pressured the Grand Duke and magnates for gaining the same rights as Polish nobility (szlachta), i.e. the Golden Freedoms. Eventually, in 1569, after Sigismund II Augustus transferred significant territories of the Grand Duchy to Poland and after months of hard negotiations, Lithuanians partially accepted Polish demands and entered in alliance with the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the next phase of the conflict, in 1577, Ivan IV took advantage of the Commonwealth's internal strife (called the war against Danzig in Polish historiography), and, during the reign of Stefan Batory in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, invaded Livonia, quickly taking almost the entire territory, except for Riga and Reval (now Tallinn). That war would last from 1577 to 1582.

Stefan Batory replied with a series of three offensives against Russia, trying to cut off Livonia from the main Russian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men, he retook Polatsk, Polish–Lithuanian troops also devastated Smolensk region, and Severia up to Starodoub.[54] During the second, in 1580, with 29,000-strong army Stefan Batory took Velizh, Usvyat,[54] Velikiye Luki. In 1581 the Lithuanians burnt down Staraya Russa,[54] with a 100,000-strong army Stefan Batory started the Siege of Pskov but failed to take the fortress. The prolonged and inconclusive siege led to negotiations, which with the aid of papal legate Antonio Possevino ended in the peace of Jam Zapolski in which the Tsar renounced his claims to Livonia and Polotsk but conceded no core Russian territories. The peace lasted for a quarter of a century, until the Commonwealth's forces invaded Russia in 1605.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovite–Lithuanian_Wars

National symbols of Lithuania,"The national symbols of Lithuania are used in Lithuania and abroad to represent the country and its people, history, culture, and nature. These symbols are seen in official capacities, such as flags, coats of arms, postage stamps, and currency, and in URLs. They appear less formally as recurring themes in  literature, art and folk art, heraldry, monuments, clothing, personal decoration, and as the names of parks, bridges, streets, and clubs. The less formal manifestations may be classified as national emblems.

Some of the symbols are more heavily weighted with meaning than others. For instance, during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the Lithuanian flag and the national anthem were replaced; the Lithuanian Coat of Arms was not shown in official capacities. On the other hand, in keeping with the Soviet policy of encouraging what were seen as harmless expressions of ethnic identity, Lithuanian national costumes were often featured on postal stamps and elsewhere.

Lithuania was occupied by Soviet Union in 1940–1941, later it was controlled by the Nazi government during World War II and was a Soviet Socialist Republic from 1944 until 1990. The latter situation is generally seen by Lithuanians as an occupation. Public displays of both the Nazi swastika and the hammer and sickle were banned in 2008.[1]

The flag was officially designated in 1918, and was re-instituted in 1988. Yellow represents the sun, light, and goodness, green symbolizes the beauty of nature, freedom, and hope, and red stands for the land, courage, and the blood spilled for Lithuania. The colors of the flag also appear in clothing, URLs[dubious – discuss], and team uniforms.

Lithuanian law states that the flag should be hoisted on historical holidays such as February 16 (marking the re-establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1918), March 11 (commemorating the re-establishment of Lithuania's independence in 1990), July 6 (marking the coronation of Mindaugas as King of Lithuania), July 15 (marking the Battle of Grunwald), October 25 (Constitution Day), and near historically significant buildings such as the Presidential Palace.

The state emblem of the Republic of Lithuania is Vytis (the white knight). The heraldic shield features a red field with an armoured knight on a white horse holding a silver sword aloft in his right hand.

The charging knight is known to have been first used as the state emblem in 1366 on the seal of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The earliest coins featuring Vytis date from the second half of the 14th century. Vytis is engraved on all current Lithuanian coins, is displayed on many Lithuanian postage stamps and official documents, and is part of the URL of official Lithuanian websites.

Former United States NFL player Joe Jurevicius bears a Vytis prominently tattooed on his arm as a symbol of his Lithuanian ancestry.

""Tautiška giesmė"" is the national anthem of Lithuania. The music and lyrics were written in 1898 by Vincas Kudirka. The song was first publicly performed in Vilnius in 1905, and became the official national anthem in 1919. It was replaced by another national anthem during the Soviet era, and was reinstated in 1992 when the new constitution was ratified. Lietuva brangi (Precious Lithuania), written by the poet Maironis, is another important song sometimes called the unofficial national anthem.[2]

Gediminas and Mindaugas are generally regarded as the founding fathers of Lithuania. Gediminas was said to have had a dream which led to the founding of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania; in this dream, an iron wolf howled all night near the site of the present-day Gediminas Tower. A seer interpreted this as meaning that a great city should be built there.
""What is destined for the ruler and the state of Lithuania, let it be: the iron wolf means a castle and a town which will be established by the ruler on this site. The town will be the capital of the Lithuanian lands and the dwelling of rulers and the glory of their deeds shall echo throughout the world"". Mindaugas was the first king of Lithuania, crowned in 1253.

The Columns of Gediminas have been dated to the 14th century. They were often drawn on walls and fences as protest against the Soviet occupation. EuroBasket 2011, which was held in Lithuania, used a modified version of the columns in its logo.[3] Gediminas is a frequently used street name, most notably Gediminas Avenue in Vilnius. Mindaugas and Gediminas are popular first names for men in Lithuania.

During the period of Vytautas the Great, Lithuania reached the biggest extension of its territory. Victory in Battle of Grunwald of 1410 (known as Battle of Žalgiris in Lithuanian) with Polish coalition became a turning point of Lithuanian history, establishing a permanent western border. During the Interwar period of Lithuania, Vytautas was regarded as the greatest ruler in Lithuanian history and 1930 was officially declared as the Year of Vytautas. Many public events, encouraged by authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona were held in 1930, generating a cult of Vytautas.

The most prominent landmark in Lithuania is probably the medieval Gediminas Tower in Vilnius; it is one of the highest points in the city, and the flag of Lithuania is flown there. During the Soviet occupation, the flag of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was displayed there; on October 7, 1988, during the independence movement that was finalized by the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania on March 11, 1990, the Lithuanian tricolor was re-hoisted atop the tower. Other significant landmarks include the Vilnius Castle Complex and its Cathedral Square, Trakai Island Castle and Hill of Crosses; they frequently appear in books, posters, stamps, and tourist brochures.

In addition to its formal use in churches, the cross in Lithuania long ago became a frequent subject of folk art. Lietuviškas kryžius is a stylized folk art cross put up at crossroads, in cemeteries, near houses, and as votive offerings in churches. The crosses combine elements of architecture, sculpture, blacksmith art, and painting. They often feature organic flourishes, motifs of the sun, birds, and represent the World Tree. To plead for grace or to express gratitude, the crosses are built as memorials to the dead or as the signs of spiritual protection at certain places. The art of Lithuanian cross crafting was acknowledged as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001 by UNESCO.

A distinctive two-barred cross – the Vytis Cross – appears on the shield held by the knight in Lithuania's coat of arms. Adopted by Grand Duke Jogaila as his personal insignia, it is usually associated with the Jogaila dynasty. This cross is displayed on Lithuanian aircraft. The Order of the Cross of Vytis is a Lithuanian Presidential Award conferred on those who have defended Lithuania's freedom and independence. The Lithuanian Air Force adopted this cross in its roundel and the Special Investigation Service and Lithuanian Riflemen's Union adopted it in the logo.

The Hill of Crosses, containing thousands of crosses of all sizes, is the best known pilgrimage site in Lithuania.

Wooden carvings of Rūpintojėlis, ""The Jesus who cares for us,"" are often seen at crossroads and in cemeteries. He always rests his head on his right arm, his left hand rests on his knee, a crown of thorns on his head shows drops of blood, and his face is full of solicitude and sorrow.

The pose may represent Jesus' anticipation of his crucifixion, after his scourging and crowning with thorns. It is also said to depict Jesus after his resurrection and before his ascension. One legend has it that Jesus traveled throughout the world wearing his crown of thorns; during his journeys, he sometimes sat on stones near the road and wept.

The patron saint of Lithuania and Poland is Saint Casimir, who is held to have a special affinity for young people; he died in his twenties. His image often appears in stained glass in Lithuanian churches, often holding a lily. Saint Casimir's Day is celebrated on March 4. He was said to have appeared as an apparition in 1518 at the Daugava River during the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars, encouraging the Lithuanians.

After his death, his relics in Vilnius became a frequent destination of pilgrims; St. Casimir's Fair developed around these pilgrimages, became an annual event, and is still held today.

Other saints who may be seen in coats of arms and elsewhere include Saint George and Saint Christopher.

Lithuania folk costumes make use of linen weavings in geometric patterns. The full costume is worn only by folk dance groups and the like, but the characteristic fabrics appear in belts, ties, scarves, and other accessories worn on national holidays.
Some parts of the folk costume are customary to only particular regions of Lithuania. Delmonas (or dalmonas, plural delmonai) – is a part of women's garb, originated in Lithuania Minor. It is essentially an elaborately decorated purse (outwear pocket), visibly attached to the waist by a waist-band, made out of dark colored velvet, silk, wool or cotton and elaborately embroided with colorful threads and glass beads. This female costume feature represents the Prussian Lithuanians and is not common to other ethnographic regions of Lithuania. In 2019 Delmonai of Lithuania Minor were inscribed into The Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Lithuania as a form of folk art, traditional craftsmanship or agricultural activities.[5]

The white stork (gandras) was declared the national bird of Lithuania in 1973.[6] Lithuanians believe that storks bring harmony to the families on whose property they nest; they have also kept up the tradition of telling their children that storks bring babies. Stork Day is celebrated on March 25 with various archaic rituals: gifts for children, attributed to the storks, such as fruits, chocolates, pencils, and dyed eggs, are hung on tree branches and fences; snakes are caught, killed and buried under the doorstep; straw fires are lit. Notably, Lithuania is a beneficial and important habitat for these birds: it has the highest known nesting density in the world.[7]

Other birds of note are the common cuckoo (gegutė) – its call is said to sweep away the last traces of winter, and the month of May (gegužės mėnuo) is named for this bird. The rock pigeon (balandis) is commemorated in the month of April (balandžio mėnuo).

Lithuania's special animals include the aurochs, the moose, the wolf (vilkas), and the bear (lokys). According to a popular legend, an iron wolf in Gediminas' dream encouraged the Grand Duke to establish Vilnius and make the city his capital. The Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade (motorizuotoji pėstininkų brigada 'Geležinis vilkas') is now the core unit of the Lithuanian Army. The bear is an ancient symbol of Samogitia, one of the regions of Lithuania, and appears in the coat of arms of Šiauliai district. A moose is shown in the Lazdijai district municipality coat of arms and the aurochs is featured in the Kaunas coat of arms.

The national plant is rue (rūta). A bride traditionally wears a little crown made of rue, which is a symbol of maidenhood. During the wedding the crown is burned, symbolizing the loss of careless childhood and entrance into the world of adulthood.

Trees of special significance include oak (ąžuolas), birch (beržas), linden (liepa), and spruce (eglė). A veneration of oak trees comes from pagan times, when they were of religious significance. The Stelmužė Oak, thought to be at least 1,500 years old, is the best-known tree in the country. The significance of trees is reflected in the Lithuanian calendar. The month of June is, in Lithuanian, ""birch"" (birželio mėnuo), and the month of July is ""linden"" (liepos mėnuo).

Amber, nicknamed ""Lithuanian gold"", has been harvested from the shores of the Baltic Sea since prehistoric times. The Palanga Amber Museum holds thousands of amber specimens and artifacts. Most women in Lithuania are believed to possess some item of amber jewelry.

Basketball, Lithuania's most popular sport, could be also considered a national symbol. During the 1980s basketball was an important outlet of national feelings, particularly when the country's favorite team, Žalgiris Kaunas, played against CSKA Moscow in the finals of the Soviet Union league. The Lithuanian basketball medals in the 1992 Olympic Games encouraged this symbolism.  The 1992 and 1996 basketball teams, which were partially sponsored by the Grateful Dead, sported red, yellow, and green tie-died T-shirts echoing the colors of the flag, featuring the now-trademarked Slam Dunking Skeleton created by New York sports artist Greg Speirs.[9][10][11][12]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_Lithuania
Occupation of the Baltic states,"The occupation of the Baltic states was a period of annexation of
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by the Soviet Union from 1940 until its dissolution in 1991. For a period of several years during World War II,  Nazi Germany occupied the Baltic states after it invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.

The initial Soviet invasion and occupation of the Baltic states began in June 1940 under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, made between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in August 1939 before the outbreak of World War II.[1][2] The three independent Baltic countries were annexed as constituent Republics of the Soviet Union in August 1940. Most Western countries did not recognise this annexation, and considered it illegal.[3][4] In July 1941, the occupation of the Baltic states by Nazi Germany took place, just weeks after its invasion of the Soviet Union. The Third Reich incorporated them into its Reichskommissariat Ostland. In 1944, the Soviet Union recaptured most of the Baltic states as a result of the Red Army's Baltic Offensive, trapping the remaining German forces in the Courland Pocket until their formal surrender in May 1945.[5]

During the 1944–1991 Soviet occupation many people from Russia and other parts of the former USSR were settled in the three Baltic countries, while the local languages, religion and customs were suppressed in an ""extremely violent and traumatic"" occupation.[6][7] Colonization of the three Baltic countries included mass executions, deportations and repression of the native population.

While there has been a broad international consensus that the Baltic states were illegally occupied and annexed,[8][9][10][11][12][13] the Soviet Union never acknowledged that they were forcefully taken over.[14] The post-Soviet government of Russia maintains the claim that the incorporations of Baltic states was in accordance with international law,[15][16] and school textbooks state that the Baltic states voluntarily joined the Soviet Union after home-grown popular socialist revolutions.[17] As most Western governments maintained that Baltic sovereignty had not been legitimately overridden,[18] they thus continued to recognise the Baltic states as sovereign political entities represented by the Baltic Legations, which functioned in Washington and elsewhere as governments in exile.[19]

The Baltic states regained de facto independence in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia started to withdraw its troops from the Baltics starting with Lithuania in August 1993. However, it was a violent process and Soviet forces killed several Latvians and Lithuanians.[20] The full withdrawal of troops deployed by Moscow ended in August 1994.[citation needed] Russia officially ended its military presence in the Baltics in August 1998 by decommissioning the Skrunda-1 radar station in Latvia. The dismantled installations were repatriated to Russia and the site returned to Latvian control, with the last Russian soldier leaving Baltic soil in October 1999.[21][22]

Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a ten-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact. The pact contained a secret protocol by which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet ""spheres of influence"".[23] In the north, Finland, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.[23] Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its ""political rearrangement""—the areas east of the Narev, Vistula and San Rivers going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west.[23] Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned the majority of Lithuanian territory to the Soviet Union.[24] Under the secret protocol, Lithuania would regain its historical capital Vilnius, previously subjugated during the inter-war period by Poland.

Following the end of the Soviet invasion of Poland on 6 October, the Soviets pressured Finland and the Baltic states to conclude mutual assistance treaties. The Soviets questioned the neutrality of Estonia after the escape of an interned Polish submarine on 18 September. On 24 September, the Estonian foreign minister was given an ultimatum: The Soviets demanded a treaty of mutual assistance to establish military bases in Estonia.[25][26] The Estonians were coerced to accept naval, air and army bases on two Estonian islands and at the port of Paldiski.[25] The corresponding agreement was signed on 28 September 1939. Latvia followed on 5 October 1939 and Lithuania shortly thereafter, on 10 October 1939. The agreements permitted the Soviet Union to establish military bases on the Baltic states' territory for the duration of the European war[26] and to station 25,000 Soviet soldiers in Estonia, 30,000 in Latvia and 20,000 in Lithuania starting October 1939.

In May 1940, the Soviets turned to the idea of direct military intervention, but still intended to rule through puppet regimes.[27] Their model was the Finnish Democratic Republic, a puppet regime set up by the Soviets on the first day of the Winter War.[28] The Soviets organised a press campaign against the allegedly pro-Allied sympathies of the Baltic governments. In May 1940, the Germans invaded France, which was overrun and occupied a month later. In late May and early June 1940, the Baltic states were accused of military collaboration against the Soviet Union by holding meetings the previous winter.[29]: 43  On 15 June 1940, the Lithuanian government was extorted to agree to the Soviet ultimatum and permit the entry of an unspecified number of Soviet troops. President Antanas Smetona proposed armed resistance to the Soviets but the government refused,[30] proposing their own candidate to lead the regime.[27] However, the Soviets refused this proposal and sent Vladimir Dekanozov to take charge while the Red Army occupied the state.[31]

On 16 June 1940, Latvia and Estonia also received ultimata. The Red Army occupied the two remaining Baltic states shortly thereafter. The Soviets dispatched Andrey Vyshinsky to oversee the takeover of Latvia and Andrey Zhdanov to Estonia. On 18 and 21 June 1940, new ""popular front"" governments were formed in each Baltic country, made up of Communists and fellow travelers.[31] Under Soviet surveillance, the new governments arranged rigged elections for new ""people's assemblies."" Voters were presented with a single list, and no opposition movements were allowed to file candidates. To get the required turnout to 99.6%, votes were forged.[29]: 46  A month later when the new assemblies met their sole item of business for each of them was a resolution to join the Soviet Union. In each case, the resolution passed by acclamation. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union duly accepted the requests in August, thus sanctioning them under Soviet law. Lithuania was incorporated into the Soviet Union on 3 August, Latvia on 5 August, and Estonia on 6 August 1940.[31] The deposed presidents of Estonia and Latvia, Konstantin Päts and Kārlis Ulmanis, were deported to the USSR and imprisoned. They died later in the Tver region[32] and Central Asia respectively. In June 1941, the new Soviet governments carried out mass deportations of ""enemies of the people"". Estonia alone lost an estimated 60,000 citizens.[29]: 48  Consequently, many Balts initially greeted the Germans as liberators when they invaded a week later.[33]

The Soviet Union immediately started to erect border fortifications along its newly acquired western border — the so-called Molotov Line.

On 22 June 1941 the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The Baltic states, recently Sovietized by threats, force, and fraud, generally welcomed the German armed forces.[34] In Lithuania, a revolt broke out and an independent provisional government was established. As the German armies approached Riga and Tallinn, attempts to reestablish national governments were made. Baltic citizens hoped that the Germans would reestablish Baltic independence. Such hopes soon evaporated and Baltic cooperation became less forthright or ceased altogether.[35] The Germans aimed to annex the Baltic territories into the Third Reich where ""suitable elements"" would be assimilated and ""unsuitable elements"" exterminated. In practice, the implementation of occupation policy was more complex; for administrative convenience the Baltic states were included with Belorussia in the Reichskommissariat Ostland.[36] The area was governed by Hinrich Lohse who was obsessed with bureaucratic regulations.[36] The Baltic area was the only eastern region intended to become a full province of the Third Reich.[37]

Nazi racial attitudes to the peoples of the three Baltic countries differed between Nazi authorities. In practice, racial policies were directed not against the majority of Balts but rather against the Jews. Large numbers of Jews were living in the major cities, notably in Vilnius, Kaunas and Riga. The German mobile killing units slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Jews; Einsatzgruppe A, assigned to the Baltic area, was the most effective of four units.[37] German policy forced the Jews into ghettos. In 1943 Heinrich Himmler ordered his forces to liquidate the ghettos and to transfer the survivors to concentration camps. Some Latvians and Lithuanian conscripts collaborated actively in the killing of Jews, and the Nazis managed to provoke pogroms locally, especially in Lithuania.[38] Only about 75 percent of Estonian and 10 percent of Latvian and Lithuanian Jews survived the war. However, for the majority of Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians, the German rule was less harsh than Soviet rule had been, and it was less brutal than German occupations elsewhere in eastern Europe.[39] Local puppet regimes performed administrative tasks and schools were permitted to function. However, most people were denied the right to own land or businesses.[40]

The Soviet administration had forcibly incorporated the Baltic national armies at the wake of the occupation in 1940. Most of the senior officers were arrested and many of them murdered.[41] During the German invasion, the Soviets conducted a forced general mobilisation that took place in violation of the international law. Under the Geneva Conventions, this act of violence is seen as a grave breach and war crime, because the mobilised men were treated as arrestants from the very beginning. In comparison with the general mobilisation proclaimed in the Soviet Union, the age range was extended by 9 years in the Baltics; all reserve officers were also taken. The aim was to deport all men capable to fight to Russia, where they were sent to convict camps. Almost half of them perished because of the transportation conditions, slave labour, hunger, diseases, and the repressive measures of the NKVD.[41][42] In addition, destruction battalions were formed under the command of the NKVD.[43] Hence, Baltic nationals fought in both German and Soviet army ranks. There was the 201st Latvian Rifle Division. The 308th Latvian Rifle Division was awarded the Red Banner Order after the expulsion of the Germans from Riga in the autumn of 1944.[44]

An estimated 60,000 Lithuanians were drafted into the Red Army.[45] During 1940, on the basis of disbanded Lithuanian Army, Soviet authorities organized 29th Territorial Rifle Corps. Decrease in quality of life and service conditions, forceful indoctrination of Communist ideology, caused discontent of recently Sovietized military units. Soviet authorities responded with repressions against Lithuanian officers of the 29th Corps, arresting over 100 officers and soldiers and subsequently executing around 20 in Autumn 1940. By that time allegedly near 3,200 officers and soldiers of 29th Corps were considered ""politically unreliable"". Due to high tensions and soldiers' discontent the 26th Cavalry Regiment was disbanded. During the 1941 June deportations over 320 officers and soldiers of 29th Corps were arrested and deported to concentration camps or executed. The 29th Corps collapsed with the German invasion into Soviet Union: on June 25–26 a rebellion broke in its 184th Rifle Division. The other division of the 29th Corps, the 179th Rifle Division lost most of its soldiers during the retreat from Germans mostly to deserting of its soldiers. A total of less than 1,500 soldiers from initial strength of around 12,000 reached the area of Pskov by August 1941. By the second part of 1942, most of Lithuanians remaining in the Soviet ranks as well as male war refugees from Lithuania were organized into 16th Rifle Division during its second formation. 16th Rifle Division, despite officially called ""Lithuanian"" and mostly commanded by officers of Lithuanian origin, including Adolfas Urbšas, was ethnically very mixed, with up to 1/4 of its personnel made of Jews and thus being the largest Jew formation of Soviet Army. A popular joke of those years said that the 16th Division was called Lithuanian, because there were 16 Lithuanians among its ranks.

The 7000-strong 22nd Estonian Territorial Rifle Corps got heavily beaten in the battles around Porkhov during the German invasion in summer 1941, as 2000 were killed or wounded in action, and 4500 surrendered. The 25,000—30,000 strong 8th Estonian Rifle Corps lost 3/4 of its troops in the Battle of Velikiye Luki in winter 1942/43. It participated in the capture of Tallinn in September 1944.[41] About 20,000 Lithuanians, 25,000 Estonians, and 5000 Latvians died in the ranks of the Red Army and labor battalions.[42][44]

The Nazi administration also conscripted Baltic nationals into the German armies. The Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, composed of volunteers, was formed in 1944. The LTDF reached a size of roughly 10,000 men. Its goal was to fight the approaching Red Army, provide security and conduct anti-partisan operations within the territory claimed by Lithuanians. After brief engagements against Soviet and Polish partisans, the force self-disbanded.[46] Its leaders were arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps,[47] and many of members were executed by the Nazis.[47] Latvian Legion, created in 1943, consisted of two conscripted divisions of the Waffen-SS. On 1 July 1944 the Latvian Legion had 87,550 men. Another 23,000 Latvians were serving as Wehrmacht ""auxiliaries"".[48] Among other battles, they participated in the Siege of Leningrad, in the Courland Pocket fighting, the defence of the Pomeranian Wall, at the Velikaya River for Hill ""93,4"" and in the defence of Berlin. The 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) was formed in January 1944 through conscription. Consisting of 38,000 men, it took part in the Battle of Narva, the Battle of Tannenberg Line, the Battle of Tartu, and Operation Aster.

There were several attempts to restore independence during the occupation. On 22 June 1941 the Lithuanians overthrew Soviet rule two days before the Wehrmacht arrived in Kaunas, where the Germans then allowed a Provisional Government to function for over a month.[40] The Latvian Central Council was set up as an underground organisation in 1943, but it was destroyed by the Gestapo in 1945. In Estonia in 1941, Jüri Uluots proposed restoration of independence; later, by 1944, he had become a key figure in the secret National Committee. In September 1944, Uluots briefly became acting president of independent Estonia.[49] Unlike the French and the Poles, the Baltic states had no governments in exile located in the West. Consequently, Great Britain and the United States lacked any interest in the Baltic cause while the war against Germany remained undecided.[49] The discovery of the Katyn massacre in 1943 and callous conduct towards the Warsaw uprising in 1944 had cast shadows on relations; nevertheless, all three victors still displayed solidarity at the Yalta conference in 1945.[50]

By 1 March 1944 the siege of Leningrad was over and Soviet troops were on the border with Estonia.[51] The Soviets launched the Baltic Offensive, a twofold military-political operation to rout German forces, on 14 September. On 16 September the High Command of the German Army issued a plan in which Estonian forces would cover the German withdrawal.[52] The Soviets soon reached the Estonian capital Tallinn, where the NKVD's first mission was to stop anyone escaping from the state; however, many refugees did manage to escape to the West. The NKVD also targeted the members of the National Committee of the Republic of Estonia.[53] German and Latvian forces remained trapped in the Courland Pocket until the end of the war, capitulating on 10 May 1945.

After reoccupying the Baltic states, the Soviets implemented a program of sovietization, which was achieved through large-scale industrialisation rather than by overt attacks on culture, religion or freedom of expression.[54] The Soviets carried out massive deportations to eliminate any resistance to collectivisation or support of partisans.[55] Baltic partisans, such as the Forest Brothers, continued to resist Soviet rule through armed struggle for a number of years.[56]

The Soviets had previously carried out mass deportations in 1940–41, but the deportations between 1944 and 1952 were even greater.[55] In March 1949 alone, the top Soviet authorities organised a mass deportation of 90,000 Baltic nationals.[57]

The total number deported in 1944–55 has been estimated at over half a million: 124,000 in Estonia, 136,000 in Latvia and 245,000 in Lithuania.[citation needed]

The estimated death toll among Lithuanian deportees between 1945 and 1958 was 20,000, including 5,000 children.[58]

The deportees were allowed to return after Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech in 1956 denouncing the excesses of Stalinism; however, many did not survive their years of exile in Siberia.[55] After the war, the Soviets outlined new borders for the Baltic republics. Lithuania gained the regions of Vilnius and Klaipėda while the Russian SFSR annexed territory from the eastern parts of Estonia (5% of prewar territory) and Latvia (2%).[55]

The Soviets made investments to integrate the Baltic economies into the larger Soviet economic sphere to extract energy resources and the manufacture of industrial and agricultural products.[59] In all three republics, manufacturing industry was developed resulting in some of the best industrial complexes in the sphere of electronics and textile production. The rural economy suffered from the lack of investments and the collectivization.[60] Baltic urban areas had been damaged during wartime and it took ten years to recuperate housing losses. New constructions were often of poor quality and ethnic Russian immigrants were favored in housing.[61] Estonia and Latvia received large-scale immigration of industrial workers from other parts of the Soviet Union that changed the demographics dramatically. Lithuania also received immigration but on a smaller scale.[59]

Ethnic Estonians constituted 88 percent of the population before the war, but in 1970 the figure dropped to 60 percent. Ethnic Latvians constituted 75 percent, but the figure dropped 57 percent in 1970 and further down to 50.7 percent in 1989. In contrast, the drop in Lithuania was only 4 percent.[61] Baltic communists had supported and participated the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. However, many of them were killed during the Great Purge in the 1930s. The new regimes of 1944 were established mostly by native communists who had fought in the Red Army. However, the Soviets also imported ethnic Russians to fill political, administrative and managerial posts.[63]

The Baltic States were net contributors rather than beneficiaries during the illegal occupation. Detailed archival records of budget revenues and expenditures demonstrate that significantly more money was extracted from these territories than was ever invested back, even including large Soviet expenditures on its military and other repressive structures created to oppress the native population. The myth of generous Soviet “aid” in industrializing and developing the Baltics is false propaganda that conceals the substantial revenues and profits were siphoned off by the occupying Soviets.[64][65][66][better source needed]

In Latvia’s case specifically, archival evidence proves that from 1946 to 1990, the USSR drew far more resources from Latvian territory than it spent on it, with over 18% of revenues net-transferred out of the republic. The same pattern holds true for Estonia and Lithuania. This economic exploitation and heavy militarization explain why the Baltic nations, which had been relatively advanced before the war, became economically stunted compared to Western Europe, underlining the extractive nature of the Soviet occupation.[64][65][66][better source needed]

The period of stagnation brought the crisis of the Soviet system. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms occasioned the reawakening of nationalism in the Baltic republics.[67] The first major demonstrations against the environment were Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals and by the end of 1988 the reform wing had gained the decisive positions in the Baltic republics.[68] At the same time, coalitions of reformists and populist forces assembled under the Popular Fronts.[69] The Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic made the Estonian language the state language again in January 1989, and similar legislation was passed in Latvia and Lithuania soon after. The Baltic republics declared their aim for sovereignty: Estonia in November 1988, Lithuania in May 1989 and Latvia in July 1989.[70] The Baltic Way, that took place on 23 August 1989, became the biggest manifestation of opposition to the Soviet rule.[71] In December 1989, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocol as ""legally untenable and invalid.""[72]

On 11 March 1990 the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet declared Lithuania's independence.[73] Pro-independence candidates had received an overwhelming majority in the Supreme Soviet elections held earlier that year.[74] On 30 March 1990, seeing full restoration of independence not yet feasible due to large Soviet presence, the Estonian Supreme Soviet declared the Soviet Union an occupying power and announced the start of a transitional period to independence. On 4 May 1990, the Latvian Supreme Soviet made a similar declaration.[75] The Soviet Union immediately condemned all three declarations as illegal, saying that they had to go through the process of secession outlined in the Soviet Constitution of 1977. However, the Baltic states argued that the entire occupation process violated both international law and their own law. Therefore, they argued, they were merely reasserting an independence that still existed under international law.

By mid-June, after unsuccessful economic blockade of Lithuania, the Soviets started negotiations with Lithuania and the other two Baltic republics. The Soviets had a bigger challenge elsewhere, as the Russian Federal Republic proclaimed sovereignty in June.[76] Simultaneously the Baltic republics also started to negotiate directly with the Russian Federal Republic.[76] After the failed negotiations the Soviets made a dramatic but failed attempt to break the deadlock and sent in military troops killing twenty and injuring hundreds of civilians in what became known as the ""Vilnius massacre"" in Lithuania and ""The Barricades"" in Latvia during January 1991.[77] In August 1991, the hard-line members attempted to take control of the Soviet Union. A day after the coup on 21 August, the Estonians proclaimed full independence, after an independence referendum was held in Estonia on 3 March 1991,[78] alongside a similar referendum in Latvia the same month. It was approved by 78.4% of voters with an 82.9% turnout. Independence was restored by the Estonian Supreme Council on the night of 20 August.[78] The Latvian parliament made similar a declaration on the same day. The coup failed but the collapse of the Soviet Union became unavoidable.[79] After the coup collapsed, the Soviet government recognised the independence of all three Baltic states on 6 September 1991.

The Russian Federation assumed the burden and the subsequent withdrawal of the occupation force, consisting of about 150,000 former Soviet, now Russian, troops stationed in the Baltic states.[80] In 1992 there were still 120,000 Russian troops there,[81] as well as a large number of military pensioners, particularly in Estonia and Latvia.

During the period of negotiations, Russia hoped to retain facilities such as the Liepāja naval base, the Skrunda anti-ballistic missile radar station, the Ventspils space-monitoring station in Latvia and the Paldiski submarine base in Estonia, as well as transit rights to Kaliningrad through Lithuania.

Contention arose when Russia threatened to keep its troops where they were. Moscow tied its concessions to specific legislation guaranteeing the civil rights of ethnic Russians, which was seen as an implied threat in the West, in the U.N. General Assembly and by Baltic leaders, who viewed it as Russian imperialism.[81]

Lithuania was the first to see complete the withdrawal of Russian troops—on 31 August 1993[82]—owing in part to the Kaliningrad issue.[81]

Subsequent agreements to withdraw troops from Latvia were signed on 30 April 1994, and from Estonia on 26 July 1994.[83] Continued linkage on the part of Russia resulted in a threat by the U.S. Senate in mid-July to halt all aid to Russia in case the forces were not withdrawn by the end of August.[83] Final withdrawal was completed on 31 August 1994.[84] Some Russian troops remained stationed in Estonia in Paldiski until the Russian military base was dismantled and the nuclear reactors suspended operations on 26 September 1995.[85][86] Russia operated the Skrunda-1 radar station until it was decommissioned on 31 August 1998. The Russian Government then had to dismantle and remove the radar equipment; this work was completed by October 1999 when the site was returned to Latvia.[87] The last Russian soldier left the region that month, marking a symbolic end to the Russian military presence on Baltic soil.[88][89]

During the 1940–1941 and 1944–1991 occupations 605,000 inhabitants of the three countries in total were either killed or deported (135,000 Estonians, 170,000 Latvians and 320,000 Lithuanians). Their properties and personal belonging were confiscated and given to newly arrived colonists – economic migrants, Soviet military, NKVD personnel, as well as functionaries of the Communist Party.[90]

The estimated human costs of the occupations are presented in the table below.[91]

The Baltic States maintain that the occupations during the war and the Soviet occupation after it had significant demographic, social and economic consequences, causing huge damage in all spheres, including the damage to the environment.[92][93][94] All three countries suffered depopulation and repression. It is estimated that during the 1939–1945 wartime occupations alone, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lost 25%, 30%, and 15% of their populations respectively.[95]

The Baltic states suffered huge economic losses because of the Soviet occupation, but estimates vary due to different methodologies. In 1995, Lithuania estimated that the occupation caused more than 23 billion euros (at the prices of that time) in damage, including loss of population, destruction of property, economic collapse, and other losses.[96] However, this methodology does not assess the losses in economic growth. Economically, Lithuania was a net donor to the USSR budget.[97] The country suffered the most before 1958, when more than half of the annual national budgets were sent to the USSR budget; later this figure decreased, but remained high until 1973, when it was about 25% of the annual national budgets; in total, Lithuania sent about a third of all its annual national budgets to the USSR budget during the entire period of occupation.[98] The special Latvian commission in 2016 calculated the economic damage of the occupation using a different methodology and estimated it at 185 billion euros (at the prices of that year).[99] According to the Estonian estimates in 2005, the economic losses from the last period of the Soviet occupation alone exceed 100 billion dollars.[100]

During the occupation period, the Baltic states suffered significant economic underdevelopment and lag compared to the other European countries. For example, in the late interwar period, Latvia's GDP per capita in international dollars (PPP) did not differ significantly from Finland's, but by 1965 it had already fallen to 64% of Finland's level (Finland – $2,221, Latvia – $1,418).[94] In 1975, this figure was 45%; in 1986, it was 50%, and in 1990, it was 45%, so by the end of the Soviet occupation, Latvia's GDP per capita (PPP) was less than half that of Finland.[94] Pre-war Estonia was also at a similar economic level to Finland, but experienced similar economic lag and underdevelopment during the occupation.[94]

The Soviet Union and its successor Russia have never paid reparations to the Baltic countries.[101]

Due to colonization and russification, the Soviet occupation also significantly changed the demographic and linguistic situation, especially in Latvia and Estonia. In 1944, Estonians made up 88–90% of the population, but according to the 1989 census, this number had decreased to 61.5%.[102] In Latvia, between 1945 and 1955 alone, the number of immigrants reached 535,000, most of whom came from Russia.[94] In 1940, Latvians made up about 79% of Latvia's population, but by 1989 this number had dropped to 52%.[103]

According to Israeli author Yaël Ronen [he] of the Minerva Center for Human Rights at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, illegal regimes typically take measures to change the demographic structure of the territory held by the regime, usually via two methods: the forced removal of the local population and transfer their own populations into the territory.[104] He cites the case of the Baltic states as an example of where this phenomenon has occurred, with the deportations of 1949 combined with large waves of immigration in 1945–50 and 1961–70.[104] When the illegal regime transitioned to a lawful regime in 1991, the status of these settlers became an issue.[104]

The Baltic states' governments themselves,[8][9] the United States[105][106] and its courts of law,[107] the European Parliament,[10][108][109] the European Court of Human Rights[11] and the United Nations Human Rights Council[12] have all stated that these three countries were invaded, occupied and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union under provisions of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.[13] There followed occupation by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944 and then again occupation by the Soviet Union from 1944 to 1991.[110][111][112][113][114] This policy of non-recognition has given rise to the principle of legal continuity of the Baltic states, which holds that de jure, or as a matter of law, the Baltic states remained independent states under illegal occupation throughout the period from 1940 to 1991.[115][116][117] The Baltic states have repeatedly sought financial compensation from Russia for damages inflicted during the illegal occupation, both individually and collectively.[118][119][120][121][122]

However, the Soviet Union never formally acknowledged that its presence in the Baltics was an occupation or that it had annexed these states[14] and considered the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republics  three of its constituent republics. On the other hand, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic recognized in 1991 that the events of 1940 were an ""annexation"".[123]

Historically revisionist[124] Russian historiography and school textbooks continue to maintain that the Baltic states voluntarily joined the Soviet Union after their each of their peoples carried out socialist revolutions independent of Soviet influence.[125] The post-Soviet government of Russia and its state officials insist that incorporation of the Baltic states was in accordance with international law[126][127] and gained de jure recognition by the agreements made in the February 1945 Yalta and the July–August 1945 Potsdam conferences and by the 1975 Helsinki Accords,[128][129] which declared the inviolability of existing frontiers.[130] However, this claim has been described by British army think tank CHACR as both ""nefarious"" and a ""horrifying insult"" — part of an intentional propaganda campaign to spread a myth of Baltic ""incorporation"".[131]
Russia also agreed to Europe's demand to ""assist persons deported from the occupied Baltic states"" upon joining the Council of Europe in 1996.[132][133][134] Also, when the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic signed a separate treaty with Lithuania in 1991, it acknowledged the 1940 annexation as a violation of Lithuanian sovereignty and recognised the de jure continuity of the Lithuanian state.[135][136]

The Baltic claim of continuity with the pre-war republics has been accepted by most Western powers.[137] As a consequence of the policy of non-recognition of the Soviet seizure of these countries,[115][116] combined with the resistance by the Baltic people to the Soviet regime, the uninterrupted functioning of rudimentary state organs in exile in combination with the fundamental legal principle of ex injuria jus non oritur, that no legal benefit can be derived from an illegal act, the seizure of the Baltic states was judged to be illegal[138] thus sovereign title never passed to the Soviet Union and the Baltic states continued to exist as subjects of international law.[139]

The official position of Russia, which chose in 1991 to be the legal and direct successor of the USSR,[140] is that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the Soviet Union freely and of their own accord in 1940, and, with the dissolution of the USSR, these countries became newly created entities in 1991. Russia's stance is based upon the desire to avoid financial liability, since acknowledging the Soviet occupation would set the stage for future compensation claims from the Baltic states.[141]

The principle of the legal continuity of the Baltic states recognized by the international community, holds that de jure, or as a matter of law, the Baltic states remained independent states under illegal occupation throughout the period from 1940 to 1991.[115][116][117] However, during the illegal occupation, the Baltic states suffered damages valued at hundreds of billions of dollars. A report by an independent commission formed by the Latvian government in 2016 concluded that the criminal actions of the Soviet occupation had inflicted on Latvia alone constituted over €185 billion in economic damages.[142] In 2011, a report concluded that the damage continued to incur costs to the Latvian government of €100 million a year.[143]

The Baltic states have repeatedly sought financial reparations from Russia for damages inflicted during the illegal occupation, both individually and collectively.[118][119][120][121][122]

In 2000, the Seimas (Lithuania's parliament) passed a law seeking compensation from Russia for the criminal damages inflicted upon Lithuania during the illegal Soviet occupation of the Baltics.[144] The move was endorsed by then-Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar and then-Latvian Prime Minister Andris Berzins who both supported cooperation in the Baltic Assembly on the issue.[144]

In 2008, the Lithuanian government again stated that seeking financial compensation from Russia for the illegal Soviet occupation of Lithuania was a priority.[145] In 2011, Lithuania continued to seek reparations with foreign minister Audronius Azubalis labeled it ""ridiculous to talk with Russia without resolving issues related to the occupation.""[146] On 23 May 2012, Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius formed a commission to move the issue forward and called for the issue of financial compensation from Russia to be included as a condition of EU-Russia relations.[147][148]

Soviet historians saw the 1940 annexation as a voluntary entry into the USSR by the Balts.[149] Soviet historiography promoted the interests of Russia and the USSR in the Baltic area, and it reflected the belief of most Russians that they had moral and historical rights to control and to Russianize the entire former Russian empire.[150] To Soviet historians, the 1940 annexation was not only a voluntary entry but was also the natural thing to do. This concept taught that the military security of mother Russia was solidified and that nothing could argue against it.[151]

Prior to perestroika, the Soviet Union denied the existence of the secret protocols and viewed the events of 1939–40 as follows:[152]

The Stalin-edited Falsifiers of History, published in 1948, says the June 1940 invasions were needed because ""[p]acts had been concluded with the Baltic States, but there were as yet no Soviet troops there capable of holding the defences"".[156] It also states regarding those invasions that ""[o]nly enemies of democracy or people who had lost their senses could describe those actions of the Soviet Government as aggression"".[157]

In the reassessment of Soviet history during perestroika, the USSR condemned the 1939 secret protocol between itself and Germany that led to the invasion and occupations in the Baltic countries.[152]

During the Soviet era, there was relatively little interest in the history of the Baltic states, which historians generally treated as a single entity due to the uniformity of Soviet policy in these territories.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, two general camps have evolved in Russian historiography. One, the liberal-democratic (либерально-демократическое), condemns Stalin's actions and the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and does not consider the Baltic states as having joined the USSR voluntarily. The other, the national-patriotic (национально-патриотическое), contends that the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was necessary to the security of the Soviet Union, that the Baltics' joining the USSR was the will of the proletariat—both in line with the politics of the Soviet period, ""the 'need to ensure the security of the USSR', 'people's revolution' and 'joining voluntarily'""—and that supporters of Baltic independence were the operatives of western intelligence agencies seeking to topple the USSR.[124]

Soviet-Russian historian Vilnis Sīpols [ru] argues that Stalin's ultimatums of 1940 were defensive measures taken against of the German threat and had no connection with the 'socialist revolutions' in the Baltic states.[158] The arguments that the USSR had to annex the Baltic states in order to defend the security of those countries and to avoid German invasion into the three republics can also be found in the college textbook ""The Modern History of Fatherland"".[159]

Sergey Chernichenko, a jurist and vice-president of the Russian Association of International Law, argues there was no declared state of war between the Baltic states and the Soviet Union in 1940, and that Soviet troops occupied the Baltic states with their agreement, and also that USSR violation of prior treaty provisions did not constitute occupation. Subsequent annexation was neither an act of aggression nor forcible and was completely legal according to international law as of 1940. Accusations of ""deportation"" of Baltic nationals by the Soviet Union are therefore baseless, he says, as individuals cannot be deported within their own country. He claims the Waffen-SS was being convicted at Nuremberg as a criminal organization and their commemoration in the ""openly encouraged pro-Nazi"" (откровенно поощряются пронацистские) Baltics as heroes seeking to liberate the Baltics from the Soviets) is an act of ""nationalistic blindness"" (националистическое ослепление). With regard to the current situation in the Baltics, Chernichenko contends the ""theory of occupation"" is the official thesis used to justify the ""discrimination of Russian-speaking inhabitants"" in Estonia and Latvia and prophesies the three Baltic governments will fail in their ""attempt to rewrite history"".[160]

According to the revisionist historian Oleg Platonov ""from the point of view of the national interests of Russia, unification was historically just, as it returned to the composition of the state ancient Russian lands, albeit partially inhabited by other peoples"". The Molotov–Ribbentrop pact and protocols, including the dismemberment of Poland, merely redressed the tearing away from Russia of its historical territories by ""anti-Russian revolution"" and ""foreign intervention"".[161]

On the other hand, Professor and Dean of the School of International Relations and Vice-Rector of Saint Petersburg State University, Konstantin K. Khudoley views the 1940 annexation of the Baltic states as involuntary. He considers the elections were not free and fair and the decisions of the newly elected parliaments to join the Soviet Union cannot be considered legitimate as these decisions were not approved by the upper chambers of the parliaments of the respective Baltic states. He also contends that the annexation of the Baltic states had no military value in defence of possible German aggression, as it bolstered anti-Soviet public opinion in future allies Britain and the US and turned the native populations against the Soviet Union: the subsequent guerrilla movement in the Baltic states after the Second World War caused domestic problems for the Soviet Union.[162]

With the advent of Perestroika and its reassessment of Soviet history, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1989 condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Germany and the Soviet Union that had led to the division of Eastern Europe and the invasion and occupation of the three Baltic countries.[citation needed]

While this action did not state the Soviet presence in the Baltics was an occupation, the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and Republic of Lithuania affirmed so in a subsequent agreement in the midst of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia, in the preamble of its 29 July 1991, ""Treaty Between the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and the Republic of Lithuania on the Basis for Relations between States"", declared that once the USSR had eliminated the consequences of the 1940 annexation which violated Lithuania's sovereignty, Lithuania–Russia relations would further improve.[136]

However, Russia's current official position directly contradicts its earlier rapprochement with Lithuania[163] as well as its signature of membership to the Council of Europe, where it agreed to the obligations and commitments including ""iv. as regards the compensation for those persons deported from the occupied Baltic states and the descendants of deportees, as stated in Opinion No. 193 (1996), paragraph 7.xii, to settle these issues as quickly as possible...."".[134][164] The Russian government and state officials maintain now that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states was legitimate[165] and that the Soviet Union liberated the countries from the Nazis.[166] They assert that the Soviet troops initially entered the Baltic countries in 1940 following agreements and the consent of the Baltic governments. Their position is that the USSR was not in a state of war or engaged in combat activities on the territories of the three Baltic states, therefore, the word ""occupation"" cannot be used.[167] ""The assertions about [the] 'occupation' by the Soviet Union and the related claims ignore all legal, historical and political realities, and are therefore utterly groundless"".—Russian Foreign Ministry.

This particular Russian viewpoint is called the ""Myth of 1939–40"" by international affairs professor David Mendeloff,[168] who states that the assertion that Soviet Union neither ""occupied"" the Baltic states in 1939 nor ""annexed"" them the following year is widely held and deeply embedded in Russian historical consciousness.[169]

The Baltic states proclaimed independence after the signing of the Armistice, and Bolshevik Russia invaded at the end of 1918.[170] Izvestia wrote in its 25 December 1918, issue: ""Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are directly on the road from Russia to Western Europe and therefore a hindrance to our revolutions... This separating wall has to be destroyed"". Bolshevik Russia, however, did not gain control of the Baltic States and in 1920 concluded peace treaties with all three of them. Subsequently, at the initiative of the Soviet Union,[171] additional non-aggression treaties were concluded with all three Baltic States:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states
Resistance in Lithuania during World War II,"During World War II, Lithuania was occupied twice by the Soviet Union (1940–1941; post-1944) and once by Nazi Germany (1941–1944). Resistance took many forms.

During the occupations, there arose parallel resistance movements in Lithuania that had competing goals due to the different priorities of the several ethnicities, besides the fringe Soviet collaborators whose fate was tied to the Soviet Union and were more united by ideology than ethnicity. For example, the anti-Nazi resistance in Lithuania was fractured into the Lithuanian anti-Nazi resistance (the Lithuanian Front, the Lithuanian Liberty Army, the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters and more), the Jewish partisans, the Polish Home Army and the Soviet partisans.[1] Notably, although the latter two resistance movements fought against Nazi occupation, they also fought for Lithuania's occupation by their respective countries.[citation needed] Many Polish resistance members were against the possibility of an independent Lithuania after the war's end.[2][needs independent confirmation]

In 1940, President Antanas Smetona fled to Germany, not wanting his government to become a puppet of the Soviet occupation. Soviet attempts to capture him were unsuccessful, and he was able to settle in the United States.

In 1940, Jan Zwartendijk, the Dutch consul in Kaunas, and Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, and his wife Yukiko disobeyed orders and saved thousands of Jewish refugees from Poland by granting them visas.[3]

In 1941, the Lithuanian Activist Front (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Aktyvistų Frontas) formed an underground government, and following the June uprising, the Provisional Government of Lithuania maintained sovereignty for a brief period.

Soviet partisans began sabotage and guerrilla operations against German forces immediately after the Nazi invasion of 1941. The activities of Soviet partisans in Lithuania were partly coordinated by the Command of the Lithuanian Partisan Movement headed by Antanas Sniečkus and partly by the Central Command of the Partisan Movement of the USSR.[4]

In 1943, the Nazis attempted to raise a Waffen-SS division from the local population as they had in many other countries, but due to widespread coordination between resistance groups, the mobilization was boycotted. The Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (Lietuvos vietinė rinktinė) was eventually formed in 1944 under Lithuanian command, but was liquidated by the Nazis only a few months later for refusing to subordinate to their command.[5][6][7]

There was no significant violent resistance directed against the Nazis. Some Lithuanians, encouraged by Germany's vague promises of autonomy,[8] cooperated with the Nazis. Pre-war tensions over the Vilnius Region resulted in a low-level civil war between Poles and Lithuanians.[9] Nazi-sponsored Lithuanian units, primarily the Lithuanian Security Police,[9] were active in the region and assisted the Germans in repressing the Polish population. In the autumn of 1943, the Home Army began retaliatory operations against the Lithuanian units and killed hundreds of mostly Lithuanian Auxiliary policemen and other collaborators during the first half of 1944.[citation needed] The conflict culminated in the massacres of Polish and Lithuanian civilians in June 1944 in the Glitiškės (Glinciszki) and Dubingiai (Dubinki) villages.

Also in 1943, several underground political groups united under the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (Vyriausias Lietuvos išlaisvinimo komitetas, or VLIK). The committee issued a declaration of independence that went largely unnoticed. It became active mostly outside Lithuania among emigrants and deportees, and was able to establish contacts in Western countries and get support for resistance operations inside Lithuania (see Operation Jungle). It would persist abroad for many years as one of the groups representing Lithuania in exile.[10][11]

Lithuanian Liberty Army during Nazi Germany's occupation opposed German policies, but did not begin armed resistance. The armed struggle began in mid-1944 when Red Army reached the Lithuanian borders after the Minsk Offensive. The LLA became the first wave of the Lithuanian partisans, armed anti-Soviet guerrilla fighters. It attempted to become the central command of the armed struggle. However, the organization headquarters was liquidated by the Soviet security forces (NKVD and KGB) by April 1946. Many Lithuanian Liberty Army fighters joined the wider movement of Lithuanian partisans.

Jewish partisans also fought against the Nazi occupation. In September 1943, the United Partisan Organization, led by Abba Kovner, attempted to start an uprising in the Vilna Ghetto, and later engaged in sabotage and guerrilla operations against the Nazi occupation.[12]

In July 1944, as part of its Operation Tempest, the Polish Home Army launched Operation Ostra Brama, an attempt to recapture that city.

As of January 2008, 723 Lithuanians were recognized by Israel as Righteous among the Nations for their efforts in saving Lithuania's Jews from the Holocaust.[13] The total number of people who helped the Jews is most definitely underestimated.[14]

Lithuanian partisans, known as the Forest Brothers, began guerrilla warfare against the Soviet forces as soon as the front passed over them in 1944, and continued an armed struggle until 1953. The core of this movement was made up of soldiers from the Territorial Defense Force who had disbanded with their weapons and uniforms and members of the Lithuanian Liberty Army, established in 1941. The underground had extensive clandestine radio and press.[15] Thousands of people engaged in active and passive resistance against the Soviet authorities.[10] The various resistance organizations eventually united under the Movement of the Struggle for the Freedom of Lithuania (Lietuvos Laisvės Kovų Sąjūdis, or LLKS), issuing a declaration of independence in 1949 that would ultimately be signed into law by the independent Republic of Lithuania in 1999.[16]
The most famous of these partisans is probably Juozas Lukša, author of several books during the resistance and the subject of a recent film.

While armed resistance ended in the 1950s, nonviolent resistance continued in various forms (e.g. through Lithuanians living abroad, the Catholic press, safeguarding local traditions and the Lithuanian language, the Sąjūdis movement, etc.), until 1991 when Russia recognized the independence declared by Lithuania on March 11, 1990.

February 16, the date that Lithuania first declared its independence in 1918, played an important symbolic role during this period. The call for volunteers for the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, the VLIK declaration of independence, and the LLKS declaration of independence were all made on February 16. This day has become a national holiday in Lithuania.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_in_Lithuania_during_World_War_II
Provisional Government of Lithuania,"The Provisional Government of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Laikinoji Vyriausybė) was an attempted provisional government to form an independent Lithuanian state in the last days of the first Soviet occupation and the first weeks of the German occupation of Lithuania during World War II in 1941.

It was secretly formed on 22 April 1941, announced on 23 June 1941, and dissolved on 5 August 1941.[1] It was formed by members of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) in Kaunas and Vilnius.

""The Lithuanian nation, tormented by the brutal Bolshevik terror, decided to build its future on the basis of national unity and social justice.""

The Lithuanian Activist Front announced the creation of the provisional government on 22 June 1941, as the June Uprising in Lithuania began.[3]

The Nazi regime envisioned Lithuania as a future part of Greater Germany, and was not much interested in Lithuanian independence. It did allow the Provisional Government to operate while it was useful.[citation needed]

Literary historian Juozas Ambrazevičius-Brazaitis became acting prime minister instead of Škirpa.[4]
He served from June 23, 1941 to August 5, 1941.

Vygantas Vareikis [lt] wrote that the Lithuanian Provisional Government ""did not encourage brutal actions"" against Jews or LAF leaders, and the local press proposed that only high-ranking Communist officials and NKVD officers should be punished by death.[5] Lithuanian rebels had liberated Lithuania by the time the Wehrmacht arrived, and rescued over 300 political prisoners who would have been killed by Cheka.[6] The June Uprising laid the foundations for anti-Nazi resistance that later transformed into an anti-Soviet resistance.[6] The Provisional Government did little to stop the anti-Jewish violence encouraged by the Nazis and the anti-Semitic leadership of the Lithuanian Activist Front. Lithuanian police battalions formed by the Provisional Government helped the Nazis carry out the Holocaust.[7] Stanislovas Stasiulis pictured the history of the Holocaust in Lithuania as ""three layers and periods."" The first, he wrote, involves the relationship between Lithuanians and Jews during the Nazi occupation, and the second followed the Soviet re-occupation.[8] The third period of interest covers the historiography since 1990, he wrote, which has attempted new and open discussions of the defensive (emigré) and ideological (Soviet) reactions to the Holocaust. The Soviet refusal to acknowledge the racialism of the Holocaust helped trigger a defensive cultural response known as double genocide theory, which equated the Holocaust and the Stalinist brutality meted out to Lithuanian by the Soviets. Considered by some a form of Holocaust trivialization, this paradigm has sometimes been taken as far as portraying Nazi pogroms as retaliation.

LAF leader Kazys Škirpa, former Lithuanian envoy to Germany, was named prime minister. But he was in Berlin and the Germans put him under house arrest. Rapolas Skipitis, another minister-to-be in Berlin, was prevented from leaving as well.[9] Vytautas Bulvičius was to become Minister of Defence but the Soviets arrested him on 2 June and General Stasys Raštikis replaced him.[10]

The Provisional Government dissolved in August 1941 after deciding that it had failed to achieve an autonomous if not independent Lithuania under German patronage.[citation needed]

June Uprising in Lithuania,"The June Uprising (Lithuanian: Birželio sukilimas) was a brief period in late June 1941 between the first Soviet and the Nazi occupations.

A year prior, on June 15, 1940, the Red Army occupied Lithuania and established the unpopular Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, which silenced its critics and suppressed resistance with political repression and state terrorism.[5] When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, the Lithuanian Activist Front initiated the June uprising for which it had been preparing since late 1940 and formed the short-lived provisional government.[1] The Lithuanian insurgents liberated Kaunas and Vilnius before the Wehrmacht arrived and within a week, all of the Lithuanian territory was free from the occupying Red Army.

The June uprising was directed militarily against the Soviets but politically against the Germans, who were against the declaration of Lithuanian independence, the establishment of the Provisional Government of Lithuania and various Lithuanian self-rule institutions.[1] The German Army was greeted by anti-communist Lithuanians as liberators from repressive Soviet rule, because of the widespread hopes that Germany would help to recreate Lithuanian independence.[1] For many Lithuanians, even a somewhat autonomous status, akin to the Slovak Republic, was appealing compared to the Soviet occupation.[6] This was not granted by the German occupiers, who steadily replaced Lithuanian institutions with their own and established the Reichskommissariat Ostland on July 17, 1941. Deprived of any real power, the provisional government disbanded itself on August 5.[citation needed] Lithuanians were quickly disillusioned with German obstruction to their independence and their subsequent anti-Nazi resistance was passive, in order to not aid Soviet victory and save up Lithuanian military power to resist a future Soviet re-occupation.[7]

In 1918, Lithuania achieved independence in the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution and secured its statehood during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. Initially prior to World War II, Lithuania declared neutrality and its Seimas passed the neutrality laws.[8]

In June 1940 the Lithuanian government submitted to the Soviet ultimatum and Lithuania was occupied, transformed into the Lithuanian SSR, and incorporated into the Soviet Union. The Soviets began implementing various Sovietization policies, including nationalization of private property, and mass arrests of political activists and others dubbed ""enemies of the people"". These arrests targeted many prominent politicians such as Aleksandras Stulginskis, Juozas Urbšys, Leonas Bistras, Antanas Merkys, Pranas Dovydaitis, Petras Klimas, government officials, military officers, and members of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union. The Lithuanian Army was reorganized as the 29th Rifle Corps of the Red Army. The Soviets also closed all non-communist cultural, religious and political organizations. The economic situation steadily worsened and the standard of living decreased.

A year later, just a week before the uprising, some 17,000 Lithuanians, mainly the intelligentsia, were taken with their entire families and deported to Siberia, where many died of the inhumane living conditions. It was the single most important precipitating event that incited popular support for the uprising and a positive predisposition toward the German invasion. Those who escaped the deportations or arrests spontaneously organized themselves into armed groups hidden in the forests and waited for the wider uprising.[10]

The ultimate goal of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), formed in the fall of 1940, was to re-establish Lithuanian independence. Started by Kazys Škirpa in Berlin, the LAF sought to unify the Lithuanian resistance, and organize and conserve resources for the planned uprising against the Soviets.[11] It acted as an umbrella organization[12] and many groups used the LAF name even though they were not connected with the LAF in Berlin.[13] The LAF established its military–political headquarters in Vilnius and organizational headquarters in Kaunas.[11] The communication and coordination between the centers in Berlin, Kaunas, and Vilnius were rather poor. The headquarters in Vilnius suffered heavily from Soviet arrests, especially in early June 1941, and became largely defunct.[14] Most of those arrested activists were executed in December 1941 in the Soviet Union.

In March 1941, the LAF in Berlin published a memorandum, titled Brangūs vergaujantieji broliai (English: Dear Enslaved Brothers), with instructions on how to prepare for the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.[15] Insurgents were asked to secure strategic objects like prisons, railroads, bridges, communication hubs and factories, guarding them against potential sabotage by the retreating Red Army, while Central Headquarters was to organize a provisional government and declare independence.[16] In April, a list of the members of the provisional government, was compiled.[17] The prime minister's post was reserved for Škirpa, four ministers were from Vilnius, six from Kaunas, and one from Berlin. The members represented a wide spectrum of pre-war political parties and, as such, claimed to represent a majority of the Lithuanian people.[18] Some have suggested that not all of the designated ministers knew about their proposed appointment to the provisional government.[19] On June 14, the Nazi authorities in Berlin insisted that Škirpa and his activists not form any government or make any public declarations without their prior approval.[19] Škirpa agreed to this, but had very little control over the activists in Lithuania itself.

At 3:15 am on June 22, the territory of the Lithuanian SSR was invaded by two advancing German army groups: Army Group North, which took over western and northern Lithuania, and Army Group Centre, which took over most of the Vilnius Region. The Germans amassed some 40 divisions, 700,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, and 1,200 airplanes for the attack on the Lithuanian SSR.[20] The Soviets had about 25 divisions, 400,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, and 1,344 airplanes in the Baltic Military District.[21] 7 rifle and 6 motorized divisions from the 8th and 11th armies were located within Lithuanian territory.[20]

The first attacks were carried out by the Luftwaffe against airports, airfields, and Lithuanian cities (Kėdainiai, Raseiniai, Karmėlava, Panevėžys, Jurbarkas, Ukmergė, Šiauliai, and others). These attacks killed some 4,000 civilians.[21] Most of the Soviet Air Forces' aircraft were obliterated on the ground (322 airplanes were lost in the air versus 1,489 destroyed on ground).[21] The Germans rapidly advanced, encountering only sporadic resistance from the Soviets near Kaltinėnai, Raseiniai, and Šiauliai, and assistance from the Lithuanians. In the Battle of Raseiniai, the Soviets attempted a counterattack, reinforced by tanks, but suffered heavy losses.[22] Within a week, the Germans had sustained 3,362 casualties but controlled all of Lithuania.[2] Soviet losses were heavy and not known precisely; estimates put them at 12–15 divisions.[2] The Red Army also lost most of the aircraft stationed there, tanks, artillery, and other equipment.[22]

Despite the generally friendly Lithuanian attitude, the Germans carried out punitive executions. For example, 42 civilians from Ablinga village were killed in response to German deaths:[23] After two German guards in Alytus were shot by unknown perpetrators, the Nazis shot 42 Lithuanian insurgents.[24] The terror in Alytus continued the next day: the Germans selected men, age 15–50, and executed them in groups of 20–25.[15]

More atrocities were carried out by the retreating Red Army. About 4,000 political and criminal prisoners arrested during the first Soviet occupation were transported to Soviet Union.[25] The NKVD organized prisoner massacres in Rainiai, Pravieniškės and Panevėžys. Forty mass killing sites have been identified in Lithuania.[26] Many others were killed en route to Soviet prisons. The largest such massacre took place near Chervyen in present-day Belarus. A list of NKVD victims in Lithuania, compiled during the Nazi occupation, includes 769 people that did not participate in the uprising.[27]

The uprising began in the early morning of June 22, 1941, the first day of the war. LAF's main forces were concentrated in Kaunas. At 10:00 am LAF held a meeting in Žaliakalnis, dividing responsibilities. It decided that its main goal was not to fight the Soviets but to secure the city (i.e. organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence.[28] By the evening of June 22, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, radio stations and radiophone.[28] Control of the telephone systems allowed Lithuanians to disconnect all known communist numbers and talk to each other without passwords or codes.[29] The Soviets had sabotaged the radio station, and repairs were carried out at night from June 22 to 23. Spare parts were delivered by medical students driving an ambulance.[30] Despite fears that not enough Lithuanian forces were guarding the radio tower, on the morning of June 23, Leonas Prapuolenis read the declaration of Lithuanian independence and the list of members of the provisional government. The broadcast was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.[30]

Also on the morning of June 23, 1941, insurgents raided Soviet armories in Šančiai,[31] Panemunė, and Vilijampolė.[32] Now armed, Lithuanians spread through the city. The Vilijampolė Bridge across the Neris River received special attention from the insurgents, as they expected the Germans to enter the city across this bridge.[29] When the Lithuanians got there however, it was already wired with explosives. Forty Soviet troops and three armored vehicles protected the bridge and waited for the right moment to detonate.[33] When the Soviets retreated from Lithuanian fire, Juozas Savulionis ran to the middle of the bridge, cut the wires, and saved it from destruction. On his way back Savulionis was killed by Soviet fire, becoming one of the uprising's first victims.[33]

The bridges over the Nemunas were prematurely destroyed by the retreating Soviets. This forced the Red Army units in Suvalkija to bypass Kaunas and may have saved the insurgents in that city. The Metalas factory became the headquarters of Šančiai insurgents who attempted to stop Soviet soldiers from crossing the Neman River by boat, or from building a pontoon bridge. In this fighting about 100 insurgents were killed, and 100 Soviets (including several officers) were taken prisoner,[31] and a large booty of equipment (including three tanks which no one knew how to operate) was captured.[34] Other groups secured police stations, shops, warehouses, and attempted to re-establish general order in the city. The insurgents hastily organized their own police and freed some 2,000 political prisoners.[34] They also organized publication of daily Į laisvę [lt] (English:Towards Freedom). Commander of the Red Army's 188th Rifle Division, Colonel Piotr Ivanov, reported to the 11th Army staff that during the retreat of his division through Kaunas ""local counterrevolutionaries from the shelters purposefully and severely fired to the Red Army (which) suffered heavy losses of soldiers and military equipment"".[35]

On June 24, 1941, the Red Army's tank units in Jonava were ordered to retake Kaunas. The insurgents radioed the Germans for assistance. The Luftwaffe bombed the tank units and they did not reach the city. It was the first coordinated Lithuanian–German action.[36] The first German scouts, Lieutenant Flohret and four privates entered Kaunas on June 24 and found it in friendly hands.[37] A day later the main forces marched into the city without impediment, almost in a parade.[38] On June 26, the German military command was ordered to disband and disarm the rebel groups.[39] Two days later Lithuanian guards and patrols were also relieved of their duties.

According to self-registration in July, there were about 6,000 insurgents,[40] spontaneously organized into 26 groups in Kaunas.[41] The largest groups numbered 200–250 men. Total Lithuanian casualties in Kaunas have been estimated at 200 dead and 150 wounded.[40]

In Vilnius, the LAF, commanded by Vytautas Bulvičius, had been dismantled by Soviet arrests just before the war and at the time Lithuanians formed only a small minority of the city's population.[4] The uprising there was smaller in scale and only started on June 23. The insurgents took over the post office, radio station, and other institutions, and raised the Lithuanian flag over Gediminas' Tower. It was easier to take control of Vilnius as most of the Red Army's units were located outside it and retreated rather quickly.[37] The first German units entered the city on June 24. The 7th Panzer Division, commanded by Hans Freiherr von Funck, had expected Red Army resistance in Vilnius and made plans to bombard that city.[2]

The 7,000–8,000 ethnic Lithuanians in the 29th Rifle Corps formed after the dissolution of the Lithuanian Army in 1940[42] deserted, and began gathering in Vilnius starting June 24. The 184th Rifle Division near Varėna was one of the first to face the advancing Germans.[43] Taking advantage of chaos among the Soviet officers, Lithuanians separated from the main corps with only a few losses and gathered in Vilnius. Only 745 soldiers of the 184th Rifle Division reached the Soviet Union.[23] The 179th Rifle Division was ordered to retreat from Pabradė–Švenčionėliai towards Pskov.[43] On June 27, the division crossed the Lithuanian border and the Lithuanian soldiers mutinied. At least 120 Lithuanians were killed in various shootouts while attempting to desert.[citation needed] About 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers (of 6,000) of the 179th Rifle Division reached Nevel.[23] Lithuanians hoped that the deserters would form the core of the new Lithuanian Army, but the Germans organized them into police battalions employed by the Germans. Some of them helped perpetrate the Holocaust.[23]

The uprising spread to other cities, towns, and villages. The level of rebel activities varied greatly across Lithuania and the uprising was spontaneous and chaotic.[4] Men joined the uprising even though they had never heard of the LAF or organized resistance in Kaunas. In most areas the insurgents followed the pattern set in Kaunas and Vilnius: to take control of local institutions, most importantly, the police, and secure other strategic objects. The insurgents also arrested Soviet activists, freed political prisoners, and hoisted Lithuanian flags.[42] A lack of guns and ammunition was almost everywhere; these were mostly obtained by disarming surrendered Soviet troops.[44] Most active insurgents were in the districts of Švenčionys, Mažeikiai, Panevėžys, and Utena.
[3] In some areas like Šiauliai had no noticeable rebel activities.[3] Once Germans entered a settlement they disarmed the insurgents. However, some local institutions (police, various committees) de facto established by the insurgents were later legalized de jure.[45]

In the Soviet era, insurgents were persecuted and the uprising was censored from the history books. Memoirs and studies, published mainly by Lithuanian-Americans, inflated the number of Lithuanians activists to 90,000 or 113,000 and casualties to 2,000 or 6,000.[3] After Lithuania regained independence in 1990 and new documents became available, historians revised the estimates down to 16,000–20,000 active participants and 600 casualties.[3] Most insurgents were young men, between 18 and 25 years old.[37] Soviet losses have been estimated at 5,000 men.[4]

Attention! Attention! This is Kaunas speaking. Independent Lithuania. Declaration of the restoration of Lithuania’s independence. Formed Provisional Government of the newly reborn Lithuania declares that it is restoring the free and independent state of Lithuania. In front of the pure conscience of the whole world, the young state of Lithuania enthusiastically promises to contribute to the organization of Europe on a new basis. The Lithuanian nation, tormented by the brutal Bolshevik terror, decided to build its future on the basis of national unity and social justice.

On June 23, 1941, at 9:28 am, ""Tautiška giesmė"", the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas.[48] LAF member Leonas Prapuolenis read independence declaration Atstatoma laisva Lietuva (Free Lithuania is Restored).[49] Prapuolenis announced the members of the provisional government and also asked the people to guard public and private property, workers to organize protection of factories, public institutions, and other important objects, and policemen to patrol their territories preserving the general public order. The message was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.

The first meeting of the provisional government took place on June 24. LAF activist Juozas Ambrazevičius replaced Kazys Škirpa, who was under house arrest in Berlin, as the prime minister. The new government attempted to take full control of the country, establish the proclaimed independence, and start a de-Sovietization campaign. During its six-week existence over 100 laws, some prepared in advance, were issued, dealing with de-nationalization of land, enterprises, and real estate, restoration of local administrative units, formation of police, and other issues. The government did not have power in the Vilnius Region, under the control of a different army group.[50] Hoping to survive, the government cooperated fully with the Nazi authorities.[38]

The Germans did not recognize the new government, but also did not take any actions to dissolve it by force (unlike the government of Stepan Bandera in Ukraine). At first German military administration tolerated the activities of the government as it did not attempt to take control of civilian institutions.[45] The Reichskommissariat Ostland, German civil administration (Zivilverwaltung) was established on July 17.[51] Rather than use brute force, the civil administration slowly removed the government's powers (for example, not allowing it to print its decrees in newspapers, or broadcast radio announcements) and supplanted its institutions, forcing the provisional government to either self-disband or to become a puppet institution.[38] Willing to cooperate if that meant recognition and some semblance of autonomy, the government did not agree to become an instrument of German occupation.[38] The government self-disbanded on August 5 after signing a protest against the Germans usurping the powers of the Lithuanian government.[52]

Usurpation of public life continued after the demise of the provisional government. The Lithuanian Activist Front was banned in September 1941 and some of its leaders transported to concentration camps. In December the last legal party of Lithuania, pro-Nazi Lithuanian Nationalist Party [lt], was also banned.[51] Most of the laws adopted by the provisional government remained paper declarations. However, a couple of laws of no immediate interest to the Germans, including local administration and education, had somewhat lasting effects.[53] The remaining government developed local administration staffed with Lithuanians. Thia allowed some passive resistance when German orders from the top could be blocked by the bottom. For example, Lithuanians resisted recruiting for a Waffen-SS division, quotas for forced labor in Germany, and the Germanization of Lithuanian schools.[54]  However many museums, libraries and other cultural centres were plundered by the Nazis, and the artefacts shipped to Germany. As they retreated from Lithuania, the Nazis burned to the ground hundreds of buildings, plants, bridges and railways before the advancing Soviet troops, and transported some of the disassembled machinery, inventories, and raw materials to Germany.[55]

Despite its failure to establish independence and meager long-term results, as Kazys Škirpa summarized in his memoirs, the uprising demonstrated the determination of the Lithuanian people to have their own independent state and dispelled the myth that Lithuania had joined the Soviet Union voluntarily in June 1940.[56] The uprising also contributed to unusually rapid German advances against Soviet Union: Pskov was reached in 17 days.[18] The events of June 1941 also caused some controversies. At the time, Lithuanian diplomats abroad, including former president Antanas Smetona and Stasys Lozoraitis, described the uprising as ""Nazi-inspired"".[56] These statements might have been attempts to persuade the United States, Great Britain, and other Western powers that Lithuania was not an ally of the Nazis.[57] The Provisional Government has been criticized for antisemitic slogans and decrees, particularly the Žydų padėties nuostatai (Regulations on the Status of Jews) of August 1. Its military unit, the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas (TDA), was employed by the Einsatzkommando and Rollkommando Hamann[citation needed] and local Lithuanian collaborators often drawn from the LAF in the mass executions of Lithuanian Jews in the Seventh fort of the Kaunas Fortress and in the provinces.[58] Jewish survivors and Lithuanian historians have documented that members of the LAF, especially in Kaunas but also in other towns, committed indiscriminate and gruesome excesses against Jewish residents, including mass killings of unarmed civilians, including women and children, often before the Nazis arrived to take control,[citation needed] most notably characterized by the Kaunas pogrom but also in many other towns throughout Lithunania.[59]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Uprising_in_Lithuania
Statutes of Lithuania,"The Statutes of Lithuania, originally known as the Statutes of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, were a 16th-century codification of all the legislation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and its successor, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Statutes consist of three legal codes (1529, 1566, and 1588), all written in Ruthenian, translated into Latin and later Polish.[1] They formed the basis of the legal system of the Grand Duchy and were ""the first full code of laws written in Europe since Roman Law""[2][3][4] and ""a major milestone inasmuch as it is the first attempt to codify significant East European legal trends"".[5] The Statutes evolved hand-in-hand with the Lithuanian expansion into Slavic lands, thus the main sources of the statutes were Ruthenian Laws, Baltic tribes had neither written culture nor systematic laws, while the Ruthenians published codified collections of law 5 centuries before the first statute of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Old Slavic customary law, as well as the nobility privileges in Poland, Magdeburg Rights, international treaties and royal charters and proclamations of the 12th to 14th centuries.[6][4][7][8]

On 28 January 1588, Sigismund III Vasa had confirmed the Third Statute of Lithuania which stated that the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth is a federation of two countries – Poland and Lithuania where both countries have equal rights within it and separated the powers of the ruler, the Seimas, the executive and the courts (this for the first time in European history ensured the rule of law in the state, but Lithuania's citizens, who were subjects to the Statute, were only nobles).[9] The Third Statute of Lithuania has outlived the statehood of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which in 1795 was annexed by Russian Empire after the Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and was abolished by the Russian tsarist authorities only on 7 July 1840.[9]

The main purpose of the First Statute was to standardize and unify the law, under one legal code, ending the prominent regional particularism. The unified law was supposed to act as a tool for better political and economic integration of the different regions.[6]

Although general land privileges (obshchezemskie privilei) of 1447, 1492 and 1506 provided certain legal norms, as a rule, they did not cover more specific types of problems, such as procedure, punishment and other finer points of law. At the diet held in 1514, the delegates made the first request for laws and rights written down in a comprehensive code. After further repeated requests for such a code, a general diet was convened in the spring of 1522 for the discussion of provisions to be included in the first statute.[10]

The First Statute was drafted in 1522 and came into force in 1529 by the initiative of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. It has been proposed that the codification was initiated by Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Mikołaj Radziwiłł as a reworking and expansion of the Casimir Code.[11] The First Statute consisted of 13 Chapters and was divided into 282 Articles.[4] The first edition was redrafted and completed by his successor Albertas Goštautas, who assumed the position of the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania in 1522.[citation needed]

The First Statute was hand-written and survived in several copies.[4] The statutes of Lithuania were translated to Latin because of Latin's superior terminology and to avoid ambiguity. Augustinus Rotundus was the most active proponent of Latin usage in Lithuania.

The second statute came into effect in 1566 by the order of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund II Augustus, and was larger and more advanced. The Grand Duke did this because of pressure from the Lithuanian nobility, as the expansion of nobles' rights since the publication of the first statute had made it redundant. The second statute was prepared by a special commission, consisting of ten members, appointed by the Grand Duke and the Council of Lords.[citation needed]

This Second Statute made the rights of Orthodox Christians and Catholics equal. It consisted of 14 Chapters and contained 367 Articles.[4]

Since May 2024, a fair copy of the First Statute in Western Ruthenian, belonging to Albertas Goštautas, and a manuscript copy of Polish translation of the Second Statute are exhibited at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.[12][13]

The Third Statute, described as an ""outstanding monument of the legal, literary and linguistic culture"",[14] was accepted in 1588 in response to the Union of Lublin, which created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[3][15] The main author and editor of this statute was the great Chancellor of Lithuania Lew Sapieha of Ruthenian origin. The statute was the first one to be printed (in contrast to the handwritten statutes before) in the Ruthenian language using the Cyrillic alphabet.[15] Translations of the statute were printed in Russia and also in Poland, where at that time laws were not thoroughly codified and the Lithuanian statute was consulted in some cases where the corresponding or comparably similar Polish laws were unclear or missing.[citation needed]

The statute reorganized and modified existing laws and also included new laws. Novel features included a tendency toward severe penalties, including capital punishment, which was in line with the general reactionary retributive trend in contemporary European law (cf. Malleus Maleficarum). The statute also provided that crimes committed by or against people from different social ranks were punished alike, following the idea of equal worth of human life. Yet the hurdles for a peasant to have a noble tried and convicted were higher than the other way around. The statute was supported by Lithuanian magnates, as it granted them special powers and privileges allowing them to keep the lesser Lithuanian nobility[citation needed] and peasants in check. As a token for being acknowledged as Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigismund III Vasa revised the Union of Lublin and approved the Third Lithuanian Statute.[citation needed]

Many features of the statute were not in line with the provisions of the Union of Lublin, which is not at all mentioned in the statute. The third article of the Statute provided that all lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania will be eternally within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and never become part of other states.[4] In this category fall e.g. the provisions about distributing local offices only to native people (or to people who had bought that status). So, too, do the many, detailed provisions about the Lithuanian estates' assemblies, which eventually were abolished by the Lublin union treaty. Thus, in everyday legal practice, the statute trumped and even usurped the union treaty.[citation needed]

A group often opposing the statute was the Polish nobility, which viewed such inconsistencies as unconstitutional, particularly since the Union of Lublin stipulated that no law could conflict with the law of the Union. The statute, however, in turn, declared the laws that conflicted with itself to be unconstitutional. Statutes of Lithuania were also used in territories of Lithuania annexed by Poland shortly before the Union of Lublin. These conflicts between statutory schemes in Lithuania and Poland persisted for many years.[citation needed]

The third variant of the Statute had particularly many humane features, such as a prohibition to enslave a free man for any crime; freedom of religion; and a recommendation to acquit the accused when there is a lack of evidence, instead of punishing the innocent. Also, it provided for double compensation for killing or hurting a woman. It was in force in the territory of Lithuania until 1840 when it was replaced by Russian laws.[16] Until then, many Russian peasants and even nobles (e.g., Andrey Kurbsky) were fleeing from despotism in the neighboring Tsardom of Russia to Lithuania.[17]

The Third Statute consisted of 14 chapters:[4]

Copies of the statutes used to be kept in each powiat (district) so they could be used and seen by each person desiring to do so.[citation needed]

Attempts by the Lithuanian nobility to limit the power of Lithuanian magnates led to the equalization of laws movement, culminating in the reforms of the election sejm of 1697 (May–June),[18] confirmed in the coronation sejm of September 1697 in the document Porządek sądzenia spraw w Trybunale Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskego.[19] These reforms limited the jurisdiction and competency of several Lithuanian offices, such as those of the hetman, kanclerz (chancellor), marszałek (marshal) and podskarbi (under-treasurer), to equate them with those of the corresponding offices in the Polish crown. Many of these offices at the time were held by members of the Sapieha family, and the changes were at least partly made with a view to reducing their power. The reforms also instituted Polish as the administrative language, replacing Ruthenian, in written documents and court proceedings, contradicting the wording of the Third Statute.[20][21]

The Statutes of Grand Duchy Lithuania were a sign of the progressive European legal tradition, and were cited as precedent in Polish and Livonian courts. Furthermore, they had a major influence on the 1649 encoding of the Russian legal code, Sobornoye Ulozheniye. After forming an association with Poland—including both the dynastic union (1385–1569) and the confederated Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)—the Lithuanian Statutes were the Grand Duchy's greatest expression of independence.[citation needed]

In 1791, efforts were made to change the system and do away with the privileges of the nobility, creating a constitutional monarchy with a modern citizenry (see Constitution of 3 May). However, these plans came to naught when Russia, abetted by Austria and Prussia, partitioned the Commonwealth. On 30 October 1794, Russian empress Catherine the Great reversed all changes of the law approved by the Great Sejm, and mandated use of the Lithuanian Statutes as the applicable law for the conquered Western Krai of Russia.[22] To facilitate the application of the decree translation of the document into Russian was started and took up to 1798. However, the print of this version of the document was swiftly forbidden as the 200-year-old document was seen as more liberal than the contemporary Imperial law.[22] The statutes remained in effect until 1840, when they were outlawed by emperor Nicholas I as part of a reprisals and russification policies after the November Uprising.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutes_of_Lithuania
Duchy of Lithuania,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Lithuania
Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars,"The Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars (also known as the Russo-Lithuanian Wars or simply Muscovite Wars or Lithuanian Wars)[nb 1] were a series of wars between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (in the later wars allied with the Kingdom of Poland) and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which was later unified with other Russian principalities to eventually become the Tsardom of Russia. After several defeats at the hands of Ivan III and Vasily III, the Lithuanians were increasingly reliant on Polish aid, which eventually became an important factor in the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Before the first series of wars in the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania controlled vast stretches of Eastern European land, from Kiev to Mozhaysk, following the collapse of Kievan Rus' after the Mongol invasions. Over the course of the wars, particularly in the 16th century, the Muscovites expanded their domain westwards, taking control of many principalities.[1][2]

Alexandr Nevsky, the Prince of Novgorod, decided to go on a campaign after the Lithuanians attacked the border area and robbed many locals. He headed to Lithuania, where he freed all the prisoners and defeated the Lithuanians at Lake Zizicekoe. On the way back, the Lithuanians tried to take revenge, but were destroyed again.[3]

The Grand Duchy of Moscow and Lithuania had fought each other since the reign of Gediminas, who defeated a coalition of Ruthenian princes in the Battle on the Irpin River and seized Kiev, the former capital of Kievan Rus'. By the mid-14th century, an expanding Lithuania had absorbed Chernigov and Severia. Algirdas, the successor of Gediminas, allied with the Principality of Tver and undertook three expeditions against Moscow, attempting to take advantage of the youth of the Grand Prince of Moscow, Dmitry Ivanovich, who nevertheless succeeded in fending off these encroachments.[citation needed]

The first intrusions of Lithuanian troops into the Moscow principality occurred in 1363. In 1368, Algirdas carried out the first major expedition against Moscow. Having devastated the Muscovite borderland, the Lithuanian prince routed the troops of the Prince of Starodub [ru] Simeon Dmitrievich Krapiva and Prince of Obolensk [ru] Konstantin Yurievich [ru]. On November 21, Algirdas routed the Moscow sentry troops on the river Trosna. However, he could not seize the Moscow Kremlin. The troops of Algirdas ruined the area around the city and captured a significant portion of the Muscovite population. In 1370, Algirdas made another expedition against Moscow. He ruined the area around Volok Lamskiy. On December 6, he besieged Moscow and started to devastate the surrounding area. Having received the message that Prince Vladimir Andreevich was coming to help Moscow, Algirdas returned to Lithuania. In 1372 Algirdas attacked the Moscow principality again and reached Lyubutsk. However, the Grand Prince of Moscow Dmitry Ivanovich routed the sentry troops of Algirdas, and the Lithuanians concluded an armistice with Moscow. In 1375, Algirdas devastated the Smolensk principality.[4]

Some Muscovite elements wished to take over all of the land that was formerly of the Kievan Rus', most of which was now in the Lithuanian state. Furthermore, Moscow sought to expand its access to the Baltic Sea, an increasingly important trade route. Thus, the conflict between Lithuania and Moscow was only just beginning.[5][6]

Conflicts resumed during the reign of Dmitry's son Vasily I, who was married to Sophia, the sole daughter of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas the Great. In 1394, Vytautas devastated the Principality of Ryazan, leaving many settlements in ashes. In 1402, he quarrelled with his son-in-law over control of the Principality of Smolensk. After Vytautas captured his capital, Yury of Smolensk fled to Vasily's court and tried to enlist his assistance in regaining Smolensk. Vasily hesitated until Vytautas advanced on Pskov. Alarmed by Lithuania's continuing expansion, Vasily sent an army to aid the Pskovians against his father-in-law. The Russian and Lithuanian armies met near the Ugra River, but neither commander ventured to commit his troops to battle. A peace ensued, whereby Vytautas kept Smolensk.

Ivan III considered himself an heir to the fallen Byzantine Empire and defender of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He proclaimed himself sovereign of all Russia,[7] and claimed patrimonial rights to the former lands of Kievan Rus'.[8] Such ambitions led to the steady growth of Muscovite territory and power. The supremacy of the Golden Horde, known as the ""Mongol Yoke,"" ended in 1480 with the defeat of Ahmed Khan bin Küchük in the Great Stand on the Ugra River. Moscow extended its influence to the Principality of Ryazan in 1456, annexed the Novgorod Republic in 1477, and annexed the Principality of Tver in 1483.[9] Further expansionist goals of Ivan III clashed with the Lithuanian interests.

Around 1486–1487, territories along the ill-defined Lithuanian–Muscovite border in the upper reaches of the Oka River were under attack by Moscow[9] and its ally Meñli I Giray, Khan of Crimea.[10] Tensions continued to rise. In August 1492, without declaring war, Ivan III began large military actions: he captured and burned Mtsensk, Lyubutsk, Serpeysk, and Meshchovsk;[11] raided Mosalsk; and attacked the territory of the Dukes of Vyazma.[12] Orthodox nobles began switching sides to Moscow as it promised better protection from military raids and an end to religious discrimination by Catholic Lithuanians. Ivan III officially declared war in 1493, but the conflict soon ended.[12] Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon sent a delegation to Moscow to negotiate a peace treaty. An ""eternal"" peace treaty was concluded on February 5, 1494. The agreement marked the first Lithuanian territorial losses to Moscow: the Principality of Vyazma and a sizable region in the upper reaches of the Oka River.[8] The lost area was estimated to be approximately 87,000 km2 (34,000 sq mi).[13] A day before the treaty's official confirmation, Alexander Jagiellon was betrothed to Helena, daughter of Ivan III (the role of the groom was performed by Stanislovas Kęsgaila as Alexander was in Poland).[14]

Hostilities were renewed in May 1500,[15] when Ivan III took advantage of a planned Polish–Hungarian campaign against the Ottoman Empire:[8] While preoccupied with the Ottomans, Poland and Hungary would not assist Lithuania. The pretext was the alleged religious intolerance toward the Orthodox in the Lithuanian court. Helena was forbidden by her father Ivan III to convert to Catholicism, which provided numerous opportunities for Ivan III, as the defender of all Orthodox, to interfere in Lithuanian affairs and rally Orthodox believers.[8]

The Muscovites promptly overran Lithuanian fortresses in Bryansk, Vyazma,[15] Dorogobuzh, Toropets, and Putivl.[16] Local nobles, particularly the Vorotynskys, often joined the Muscovite cause. Another attack came from the southeast into Kiev Voivodeship, Volhynia, and Podolia.[14] On July 14, 1500, the Lithuanians suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha, and the Lithuanian Grand Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski was captured. The defeat was one of the reasons for the proposed Union of Mielnik between Poland and Lithuania.[17] In November 1501, the Lithuanians were defeated again in the Battle of Mstislavl. The Crimean Tatars destroyed the Golden Horde, a Lithuanian ally, when its capital New Sarai was conquered in 1502.[18]

In June 1501, John I Albert, King of Poland, died leaving his brother Alexander Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania, the strongest candidate for the Polish throne. Alexander became preoccupied with the succession.[19] To counter religious accusations, Alexander attempted to establish a church union between Catholics and Orthodox as it was envisioned at the Council of Florence – the Orthodox would retain their traditions but would accept the pope as their spiritual sovereign.[20] The Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus' agreed to such an arrangement, but Helena protested. Polish nobles, including Bishop Erazm Ciołek and Cardinal Frederick Jagiellon, discussed the issue of royal divorce.[21]

In the meantime, the war continued, just not as successfully for Moscow. As Lithuanian forces arrived in the region, the Muscovite forces had to move slowly. Additionally, the Livonian Order, led by Wolter von Plettenberg, joined the war as a Lithuanian ally.[16] The Livonian troops won the Battle of the Siritsa River in August 1501, besieged Pskov, and won the Battle of Lake Smolino in September 1502. In 1502, Ivan III organized a campaign to capture Smolensk, but the city withstood the siege as Muscovites chose a poor strategy and had insufficient artillery.[16] Peace negotiations began in mid-1502. Alexander asked Vladislaus II of Hungary to act as the mediator, and a six-year truce was concluded on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1503.[22] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost approximately 210,000 square kilometres (81,000 sq mi),[13] or a third of its territory: Chernigov, Novgorod-Seversk, Starodub, and lands around the upper Oka River.[8] Russian historian Matvei Kuzmich Liubavskii counted Lithuanian losses at 70 volosts, 22 towns, and 13 villages.[23] The Lithuanians also acknowledged Ivan's title, sovereign of all Russia.[10][7]

Historian Edvardas Gudavičius said: ""The war of 1492–1494 was a kind of reconnaissance mission conducted by the united Russia. [The terms of] the ceasefire of 1503 showed the planned political aggression of Russia, its undoubted military superiority. The concept of the sovereign of all Russia, put forward by Ivan III, did not leave room for the existence of the Lithuanian state"".[7]

During the Muscovite–Lithuanian War of 1503, the Crimean Tatar armies pillaged the Lithuania's southern towns of Slutsk, Kletsk, and Nyasvizh and even threatened the capital city of Vilnius. Alexander Jagiellon then ordered the construction of a defensive wall around his capital, which was completed in 1522.[24]

In 1506, Alexander died. Vasili III, who succeeded his father Ivan III in 1505, advanced his bid for the Polish throne,[25] but Polish nobles chose Sigismund I the Old, who was crowned both as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1507, Sigismund I sent envoys to Moscow to request the return of the territories acquired by the 1503 truce.[26] At the same time, Khan Meñli I Giray broke off his alliance with Moscow due to its campaign against Kazan.[25] Sigismund I received an yarlıq for the Muscovite territories of Novgorod, Pskov, and Ryazan.[25]

The war was intertwined with a rebellion by Michael Glinski, Court Marshal of Lithuania, a favorite of Alexander Jagiellon and a man of opportunity.[27] When Sigismund I the Old succeeded Alexander in 1506, he did not show the same favors to Glinski. Jan Zabrzeziński, Voivode of Trakai and Glinki's old political opponent, accused Glinski of treason – he alleged that Glinski poisoned Grand Duke Alexander and had ambitions of becoming king himself.[28] Glinski then organized a rebellion, murdered Zabrzeziński in February 1508, and declared himself the defender of the Orthodox faith (even though he was a Catholic of Mongol descent).[28] His followers unsuccessfully attacked the Kaunas Castle in an attempt to liberate the prisoner Ahmad, Khan of the Great Horde.[29] Glinski then established himself in Turov and contacted Vasili III. Glinski started retreating towards Moscow and attempted to capture Minsk, Slutsk, Mstsislaw, and Krychaw. He only managed to take Mazyr when his relative opened the gates.[29] Near Orsha, he joined with Muscovite forces but was defeated by Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski.[30] This series of defeats demonstrated the rebellion, despite its claims to protect the rights of the Orthodox, was not supported by the general population and did not spread.[29] The war eventually ended with the inconclusive 'eternal peace treaty' on October 8, 1508, which maintained the territorial accords of the 1503 truce.[31]

Despite the peace treaty, the relationship between the two countries remained tense. Sigismund I demanded Michael Glinski's extradition for trial, while Vasili III demanded better treatment of his widowed sister Helena.[32] Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was paying Khan Meñli I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[33] At the same time, Albert of Prussia became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and was unwilling to acknowledge Poland's suzerainty as required by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466).[34] The tension eventually resulted in the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521) and allied Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor with Vasili III.[33]

In December 1512, Moscow invaded the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture Smolensk, a major trading center.[35] Their first six- and four-week sieges in 1513 failed,[36] but the city fell in July 1514.[37] Prince Vasily Nemoy Shuysky was left as viceregent in Smolensk.[37] This angered Glinski, who threatened to rejoin Sigismund I but was imprisoned by the Russians.[38]

Russia then suffered a series of defeats in the field. In 1512, Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Konstanty Ostrogski, ravaged Severia and defeated a 6,000-strong Russian force. On 8 September 1514, the Russians suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Orsha.[39] Despite their victory, his army was unable to move quickly enough to recapture Smolensk.[40] In 1518, Russian forces were beaten during the siege of Polotsk,[41] when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their patron saint, Saint Casimir. The Russians invaded Lithuania again in 1519, raiding Orsha, Mogilev, Minsk, Vitebsk, and Polotsk.[42]

By 1521, Sigismund had defeated the Grand Master and allied with the Kazan and Crimean Tatar hordes against Moscow.[43] Khan of Crimea, Mehmed I Giray carried out a ruinous attack on the Moscow principality, resulting in a commitment from the grand prince to pay tribute.[44] The Lithuanian troops led by Dashkovich participated in the attack and tried to take Ryazan.[45]

In 1522, a treaty was signed that called for a five-year truce, no prisoner exchange, and for Russia to retain control of Smolensk.[46] The truce was subsequently extended to 1534.[47]

Upon Vasily's death in 1533, his son and heir, Ivan IV, was only three years old. His mother, Elena Glinskaya, acted as the regent and engaged in power struggles with other relatives and boyars.[48] The Polish–Lithuanian monarch decided to take advantage of the situation and demanded the return of territories conquered by Vasily III.[49] In the summer of 1534, Grand Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł and the Tatars devastated the area around Chernigov, Novgorod Seversk, Radogoshch, Starodub, and Briansk.[43] In October 1534, a Muscovite army under the command of Prince Ovchina-Telepnev-Obolensky, Prince Nikita Obolensky, and Prince Vasily Shuisky invaded Lithuania, advancing as far as Vilnius and Naugardukas, and built a fortress on Lake Sebezh the following year, before being stopped.[50] The Lithuanian army under Hetman Radziwill, Andrei Nemirovich, Polish Hetman Jan Tarnowski, and Semen Belsky launched a powerful counterattack and took Gomel and Starodub.[51]

In 1536, the fortress Sebezh defeated Nemirovich's Lithuanian forces when they tried to besiege it, and then the Muscovites attacked Liubech, razed Vitebsk, and built fortresses at Velizh and Zavoloche.[51] Lithuania and Russia negotiated a five-year truce, without prisoner exchange, in which Homel stayed under the king's control, while Moscow kept Sebezh and Zavoloche.[52]

In 1547, the Tsardom of Russia was officially proclaimed when Ivan IV was crowned as tsar of all Russia. The tsar sought to gather the ethnically Ruthenian lands of the former Kievan Rus', engaging with other powers around the Baltic Sea in the Livonian War.

During the reign of Sigismund II Augustus in Poland and Lithuania, Tsar Ivan IV invaded Livonia, first in 1558 when the Livonian Knights sought an alliance with Poland and Lithuania; the Poles and Lithuanians were able to defend only southern Livonia. Lithuania and Poland were initially allied with Denmark and fought against the Tsardom of Russia allied with Sweden; after several years the coalitions changed and Poland–Lithuania allied themselves with Sweden against Russia and Denmark. Eventually, the 1570 ceasefire divided Livonia between the participants, with Lithuania controlling Riga and Russians expanding access to the Baltic Sea by taking hold of Narva.

The Lithuanians felt increasingly pressured by the Tsar; further, Lithuanian lesser nobility pressured the Grand Duke and magnates for gaining the same rights as Polish nobility (szlachta), i.e. the Golden Freedoms. Eventually, in 1569, after Sigismund II Augustus transferred significant territories of the Grand Duchy to Poland and after months of hard negotiations, Lithuanians partially accepted Polish demands and entered in alliance with the Union of Lublin, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the next phase of the conflict, in 1577, Ivan IV took advantage of the Commonwealth's internal strife (called the war against Danzig in Polish historiography), and, during the reign of Stefan Batory in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, invaded Livonia, quickly taking almost the entire territory, except for Riga and Reval (now Tallinn). That war would last from 1577 to 1582.

Stefan Batory replied with a series of three offensives against Russia, trying to cut off Livonia from the main Russian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men, he retook Polatsk, Polish–Lithuanian troops also devastated Smolensk region, and Severia up to Starodoub.[54] During the second, in 1580, with 29,000-strong army Stefan Batory took Velizh, Usvyat,[54] Velikiye Luki. In 1581 the Lithuanians burnt down Staraya Russa,[54] with a 100,000-strong army Stefan Batory started the Siege of Pskov but failed to take the fortress. The prolonged and inconclusive siege led to negotiations, which with the aid of papal legate Antonio Possevino ended in the peace of Jam Zapolski in which the Tsar renounced his claims to Livonia and Polotsk but conceded no core Russian territories. The peace lasted for a quarter of a century, until the Commonwealth's forces invaded Russia in 1605.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscovite–Lithuanian_Wars

Pale of Settlement,"The Pale of Settlement[a] was a western region of the Russian Empire with varying borders that existed from 1791 to 1917 (de facto until 1915) in which permanent residency by Jews was allowed and beyond which Jewish residency, permanent or temporary,[1] was mostly forbidden. Most Jews were still excluded from residency in a number of cities within the Pale as well. A few Jews were allowed to live outside the area, including those with university education, the ennobled, members of the most affluent of the merchant guilds and particular artisans, some military personnel and some services associated with them, including their families, and sometimes their servants. Pale is an archaic term meaning an enclosed area.

The Pale of Settlement included all of modern-day Belarus and Moldova, much of Lithuania, Ukraine and east-central Poland, and relatively small parts of Latvia and what is now the western Russian Federation. It extended from the eastern pale, or demarcation line inside the country, westwards to the Imperial Russian border with the Kingdom of Prussia (later the German Empire) and Austria-Hungary. Furthermore, it comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and largely corresponded to historical lands of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Cossack Hetmanate, the Ottoman Empire (with Yedisan), Crimean Khanate, and eastern Principality of Moldavia (Bessarabia).

Life in the Pale for many was economically bleak. Most people relied on small service or artisan work that could not support the number of inhabitants, which resulted in emigration, especially in the late 19th century. Even so, Jewish culture, especially in Yiddish, developed in the shtetls (small towns), and intellectual culture developed in the yeshivas (religious schools) and was also carried abroad.

The Russian Empire during the existence of the Pale was predominantly Orthodox Christian, in contrast to the area included in the Pale with its large minorities of Jewish, Roman Catholic and until mid-19th century Eastern Catholic population (although much of modern Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova are predominantly Eastern Orthodox). While the religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale is clear (conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, the state religion, released individuals from the strictures), historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and nationalist in nature.

The end of the enforcement and formal demarcation of the Pale coincided with the beginning of World War I in 1914, when large numbers of Jews fled into the Russian interior to escape the invading Imperial German Army, and then ultimately in 1917 with the end of the Russian Empire as a result of the February Revolution.[2][3]

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term Pale of Settlement was a calque of Russian čerta osedlosti[b] (lit. 'boundary of settlement') and was first attested in English in the 1890s.[4]

The term pale with the archaic meaning “a district or territory within determined bounds, or subject to a particular jurisdiction” was first used in the 1540s to describe various defended enclosures of territory inside other countries, such as the English jurisdiction of Ireland and of France. The meaning was extended from the older sense “an area enclosed by a fence”, though the meaning doesn't necessarily refer to a literal fence, even in its early use.[5][6] The word itself, attested since the 12th century, was derived from Latin palus (denoting “a stake” and “a wooden post used by Roman soldiers to represent an opponent during fighting practice”).[5][7] By extension, the Pale is also shorthand for the Pale of Settlement.[5]

The territory that would become the Pale first began to enter Imperial Russian hands in 1772, with the First Partition of Poland. At the time, most Jews (and in fact most imperial subjects) were restricted in their movements. The Pale came into being under the rule of Catherine the Great in 1791,[8] initially as a measure to speed colonization of territory on the Black Sea recently acquired from the Ottoman Empire. Jews were allowed to expand the territory available to them, but in exchange Jewish merchants could no longer do business in non-Pale Russia.[9]

The institution of the Pale became more significant following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, since, until then, the empire's (former Muscovy's) Jewish population had been rather limited.[10] The dramatic westward expansion of the Russian Empire through the annexation of Polish–Lithuanian territory substantially increased the Jewish population.[11] At its height, the Pale had a Jewish population of over five million, and represented the largest component (40 percent) of the world's Jewish population at that time.[12] The freedom of movement of non-Jewish imperial subjects was greatly increased, but the freedom of movement of Jews was greatly restricted and officially kept within the boundaries of the pale.[9]

The name ""Pale of Settlement"" first arose under the rule of Tsar Nicholas I. Under his rule (1825 to 1855), the Pale gradually shrank and became more restrictive. In 1827, Jews living in Kiev were severely restricted by imperial decree. In 1835 the provinces of Astrakhan and the North Caucasus were removed from the Pale. Nicholas tried to remove all Jews from within 80 kilometres (50 mi) of the Austrian Empire's border in 1843. In practice, this was very difficult to enforce, and the restrictions were lessened in 1858.[9]

Tsar Alexander II, who ruled 1855 to 1881,[13] expanded the rights of rich and educated Jews to leave and live beyond the Pale, which led many Jews to believe that the Pale might soon be abolished.[9] These hopes vanished when Alexander II was assassinated in 1881.[13] Rumors spread that he had been assassinated by Jews,[14][15] and in the aftermath anti-Jewish sentiment skyrocketed. Anti-Jewish pogroms rocked the country from 1881 through 1884. The reactionary Temporary regulations regarding the Jews of 1881 prohibited any new Jewish settlement outside of the Pale. The laws also granted peasants the right to demand the expulsion of Jews in their towns. The laws were anything but temporary, and would be in full effect until at least 1903. In 1910, Jewish members of the State Duma proposed the abolition of the Pale, but the power dynamic of Duma meant that the bill never had a realistic chance to pass. Far-right political elements in the Duma responded by proposing that all Jews be expelled from the Russian Empire.[9]

At times, by imperial decree Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, (as in Kiev, Sevastopol and Yalta), and were forced to move to small provincial towns, thus fostering the rise of the shtetls.[citation needed] Jewish merchants of the First Guild (купцы первой гильдии, the wealthiest sosloviye of merchants in the Russian Empire), people with higher or special education, university students, artisans, army tailors, ennobled Jews, soldiers (drafted in accordance with the Recruit Charter of 1810), and their families had the right to live outside the Pale of Settlement.[16] In some periods, special dispensations were given for Jews to live in the major imperial cities, but these were tenuous, and several thousand Jews were expelled to the Pale from Moscow as late as 1891. The extremely restrictive decrees and recurrent pogroms led to much emigration from the Pale, mainly to the United States and Western Europe. However, emigration could not keep up with birth rates and expulsion of Jews from other parts of the Russian Empire, and thus the Jewish population of the Pale continued to grow.[9]

During World War I, the Pale lost its rigid hold on the Jewish population when large numbers of Jews fled into the Russian interior to escape the invading German army. The Pale of Settlement de facto ceased to exist on August 19, 1915, when the administrator of the Ministry of Internal Affairs allowed, in view of the emergency circumstances of wartime, the residence of Jews in urban settlements outside the Pale of Settlement, with the exception of capitals and localities under the jurisdiction of the ministers of the imperial court and the military (that is, palace suburbs of Petrograd and the frontline).[17][18] The Pale formally came to an end soon after the abdication of Nicholas II, and as revolution gripped Russia. On March 20 (April 2 N.S.), 1917, the Pale was abolished by the Russian Provisional Government decree, On the abolition of religious and national restrictions.[19][9] The Second Polish Republic was reconstituted from much of the former territory of the Pale in the aftermath of World War I.[20] Subsequently, most of the Jewish population of the area would perish in the Holocaust one generation later.[9]

Jewish life in the shtetls (Yiddish: שטעטלעך, shtetlekh, ""little towns"") of the Pale of Settlement was hard and poverty-stricken.[21] Following the Jewish religious tradition of tzedakah (charity), a sophisticated system of volunteer Jewish social welfare organizations developed to meet the needs of the population. Various organizations supplied clothes to poor students, provided kosher food to Jewish soldiers conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army, dispensed free medical treatment for the poor, offered dowries and household gifts to destitute brides, and arranged for technical education for orphans. According to historian Martin Gilbert's Atlas of Jewish History, no province in the Pale had less than 14% of Jews on relief; Lithuanian and Ukrainian Jews supported as much as 22% of their poor populations.[22]

The concentration of Jews in the Pale, coupled with Tsar Alexander III's ""fierce hatred of the Jews"", and the rumors that Jews had been involved in the assassination of his father Tsar Alexander II, made them easy targets for pogroms and anti-Jewish riots by the majority population.[23]  These, along with the repressive May Laws, often devastated whole communities. Though attacks occurred throughout the existence of the Pale, particularly devastating Russian pogroms occurred from 1881 to 1883 and from 1903 to 1906,[24] targeting hundreds of communities, assaulting thousands of Jews, and causing considerable property damage.

Jews typically could not engage in agriculture due to restrictions on Jews owning land and farming in the Pale,[25] and were thus predominantly merchants, artisans, and shopkeepers. This made poverty a serious issue among the Jews. However, a robust Jewish community welfare system arose; by the end of the 19th century nearly 1 in 3 Jews in the Pale were being supported by Jewish welfare organizations.[26][9] This Jewish support system included, but was not limited to, providing free medicine to the poor, giving dowries to poor brides, kosher food to Jewish soldiers, and education to orphans.[8]

One outgrowth of the concentration of Jews in a circumscribed area was the development of the modern yeshiva system. Prior to the Pale, schools to study the Talmud were a luxury. This began to change when the rabbi Chaim of Volozhin began a sort of national-level yeshiva. In 1803, he founded the Volozhin Yeshiva and began to attract large number of students from around the Pale. The Tsarist authorities were not pleased with the school and sought to make it more secular, eventually closing it in 1879. The authorities re-opened it in 1881, but required all teachers to have diplomas from Russian institutions and to teach Russian language and culture. This requirement was not only untenable to the Jews, but essentially impossible, and the school closed for the last time in 1892. Regardless, the school had great impact: its students went on to form many new yeshivas in the Pale, and reignited the study of the Talmud in Russia.[8]

After 1886, the Jewish quota was applied to education, with the percentage of Jewish students limited to no more than 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale and 3% in the capitals of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev.[citation needed] The quotas in the capitals, however, were increased slightly in 1908 and 1915.[citation needed]

Amid the difficult conditions in which the Jewish population lived and worked, the courts of Hasidic dynasties flourished in the Pale.[citation needed] Thousands of followers of rebbes such as the Gerrer Rebbe Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter (known as the Sfas Emes), the Chernobyler Rebbe, and the Vizhnitzer Rebbe flocked to their towns for the Jewish holidays and followed their rebbes' minhagim (Hebrew: מנהגים, Jewish practices) in their own homes.[citation needed]

The tribulations of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement were immortalized in the writings of Yiddish authors such as humorist Sholem Aleichem, whose novel Tevye der Milkhiger (Yiddish: טבֿיה דער מילכיקער, Tevye the Milkman, in the form of the narration of Tevye from a fictional shtetl of Anatevka to the author) forms the basis of the theatrical (and subsequent film) production Fiddler on the Roof. Because of the harsh conditions of day-to-day life in the Pale, some two million Jews emigrated from there between 1881 and 1914, mainly to the United States.[27]

In 1912–1914, S. An-sky led the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition to the Pale, which visited around 70 shtetls in Volyn, Podolia, and Galicia, gathering folk stories and artifacts, recording music, and making photos, as an attempt to preserve and salvage traditional Ashkenazim culture that was vanishing because of modernization, pogroms, and emigration.

The Pale of Settlement included the following areas.

The ukase of Catherine the Great of December 23, 1791 limited the Pale to:

After the Second Partition of Poland, the ukase of June 23, 1794, the following areas were added:

After the Third Partition of Poland, the following areas were added:

After 1805 the Pale gradually shrank, and became limited to the following areas:

Rural areas for 50 versts (53 km) from the western border were closed for new settlement of the Jews.

In 1917 Congress Poland did not belong to the Pale of Settlement but Jews were allowed to settle there.[16]

According to the 1897 census, the governates or guberniyas had the following percentages of Jews:[28]

In 1882 it was forbidden for Jews to settle in rural areas.

The following cities within the Pale were excluded from it:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement
Polish–Lithuanian identity,"The Polish–Lithuanian identity describes individuals and groups with histories in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth or with close connections to its culture. This federation, formally established by the 1569 Union of Lublin between the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, created a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional state founded on the binding powers of national identity and shared culture rather than ethnicity or religious affiliation.[1][2] The term Polish-Lithuanian has been used to describe various groups residing in the Commonwealth, including those that did not share the Polish or Lithuanian ethnicity nor their predominant Roman Catholic faith.[3][4][5][6]

The usage of ""Polish-Lithuanian"" in this context can potentially be confusing, particularly as the term is often abbreviated to just ""Polish"", or misinterpreted as being a simple mix of the 20th-century nationalistic usage of the terms ""Polish"" and ""Lithuanian"",[1][3] as, depending on the context, it may include numerous ethnic groups that inhabited the Commonwealth.

Self-identifications during the existence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth often made use of the Latin 'gens-natione' construct (familial or ethnic origin combined with a national identity).[7] The construct was used by the elite inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, by the Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) elites, and in Prussia. Religious affiliation was sometimes added, leading to self-identifications such as Natione Polonus, gente Prussicus (Polish by nationality, of the Prussian people); or Natione Polonus, gente Ruthenus, origine Judaeus (Polish by nationality, of the Ruthenian people, and of Jewish origin).[8][9] The Latin phrasing reflects the use of that language as a neutral lingua franca, which continued into the 18th century.[10]

The Commonwealth’s nobility (Szlachta) were also bound together during this era by a widespread belief in Sarmatism that transcended ethnic identifications.[11] This origin myth posited that the Commonwealth’s noble class stemmed from a group of warriors from Scythia, that its members were racially distinct from and superior to the other inhabitants of the area, and that various features of the Commonwealth displayed its superiority.[12][13] The Ruthenian nobility of the Commonwealth subscribed to Sarmatism to some extent as well, as part of a Sarmatian branch known as ""Roxolanians"".[14] Lithuanian elites developed a theory about their Roman origins – most known is Palemonian myth and Palemonids. The theory of the Roman descent of Lithuanians heretofore mostly used to be considered as emerging during Vytautas the Great times (1392–1430), with Lithuania as a 'corrupted' form of l'ltalia.[15] Maciej Stryjkowski and Augustinus Rotundus were strong proponents of using Latin as an official language of Grand Duchy of Lithuania due to their belief that the Lithuanian language was simply a vernacular variety of Latin. Their belief was based on grammatical similarities of Lithuanian and Latin.

The Lublin Union of 1569 initiated voluntary Polonization of the Lithuanian upper classes, including increasing use of the Polish language, although they retained a strong sense of Lithuanian identity.[16] Those who identified themselves as gente Lithuanus, natione Polonus (""a Lithuanian person of the Polish nation"") were distinguished by their accent, customs, and cuisine, and did not perceive the categories as mutually exclusive.[17] A diminishing portion of Lithuanian nobility and most of the rural population in the territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania continued to use the Lithuanian language, especially in Samogitia, a practice that reached its nadir in the 18th century, and increased during the 19th-century Lithuanian National Revival.[18][19] According to Norman Davies, till the Revival, Lithuanian had no[dubious – discuss] agreed upon written form and Lithuanian literature was mostly religious, and the language was rarely[dubious – discuss] heard in the Grand Duchy's capital of Vilnius.[19] Lithuanian humanists Stanislovas Rapolionis (1485–1545), Abraomas Kulvietis (1510–1545), Mikalojus Daukša (1527–1613), Konstantinas Sirvydas (1579–1631) promoted the use of Lithuanian language as part of identity. Famous for his eloquence, Sirvydas spent 10 years of his life preaching sermons at St. John's church in Vilnius (twice a day – once in Lithuanian, and once in Polish).[20]

The adjectival terms Lithuanian and Polish-Lithuanian have been used to describe groups residing in the Commonwealth that did not share the Lithuanian ethnicity nor their pre-dominant Christian (Catholic) faith,[3] for example in the description of the Lipka Tatars (Lithuanian Tatars), a Muslim community,[4] and Litvaks (Lithuanian Jews), a significant Jewish community.[5] Eastern Orthodox and Uniate communities also played a role in the Commonwealth's history.[6]

German minority, heavily represented in the towns (burghers), particularly in the Royal Prussia region, was another group with ties to that culture (""Natione Polonus-gente Prussicus"").[9][21] Many Prussians from that region identified themselves not as Germans nor Poles, but as the citizens of the multicultural Commonwealth.[21][22]

The Commonwealth ceased to exist after the late 18th century Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth; Poland and Lithuania achieved independence as separate nations after World War I. The development of nationalism through the Lithuanian National Revival was a crucial factor that led to the separation of the modern Lithuanian state from Poland; similar movements took hold in Ukraine and later in Belarus (the territories of both modern countries had formerly been part of the Commonwealth, but did not achieve independence until after the late 20th-century collapse of the Soviet Union).[23][19] Lithuanian nationalism was a reaction to both the Russification in the Russian partition, and to the threat of further Polonization due to the pressure of Polish culture.[23][19] The Lithuanian nationalist desire to be separate from Poland was exemplified for example in the adoption of the Czech alphabet over the Polish one for the Lithuanian alphabet.[23][24] The old cultural identities lost the fight to the more attractive ethnic, religious and linguistic-based ones.[24] Following the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861, social mobility increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe.[25]

The dual identity maintained by many leading figures of Polish-Lithuanian history, the gente Lithuanus, natione Polonus attitude still popular in the early 19th century, was increasingly less feasible as the century pressed ahead.[24] The leaders of the unsuccessful January Uprising of 1863–1865 invoked the former commonalities, appealing to ""Brother Ruthenians and Lithuanians"" and to ""Brothers of the Poles of the Mosaic Persuasion"". The peasants in the region were largely unmoved since they had never shared the constructed national identity of the elites.[26] While some non-noble inhabitants saw no contradiction in describing themselves as ""a Pole, and a Lithuanian as well"",[23] dual identity was not widely considered as a matter of course. From this point of view, the conduct of Napoleon in Lithuania is noteworthy. On 1 July 1812, Napoleon formed the Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission. The provisional government of Lithuania had no connections to Poland. Napoleon also refused to attach the military units consisting of Lithuanians to the Polish ones.[27] On July 14, 1812, the Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission formally submitted to the General Council of the Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland.[citation needed]

Krajowcy, a group of individuals who tried to maintain their dual identity, emerged in the early years of 20th century in an effort to recreate a federalist Grand Duchy of Lithuania in close association with Poland.[28] Their political program, as well as Piłsudski's idea of a Polish-led federation re-creating the Commonwealth (Międzymorze), became a failure.[29][30] An analogy can be drawn here with regards to the split between Finnish and Swedish culture (see Finnish Declaration of Independence).[31]

Lithuanian nobleman Mečislovas Davainis-Silvestraitis published newspapers Litwa (Lithuania, 1908–1914) and Lud (People, 1912–1914) in Vilnius with the objective of returning of the nobility into the Lithuanian nation. The main point of returning was to make Lithuanian their family and everyday language. An active figure in the 1863 rebellion, writer and publicist Mikalojus Akelaitis wrote:

We should lift up the Lithuanian language, wrest away from scorn that language which has the Sanskrit greatness, the Latin force, the Greek refinement, and the Italian melodiousness.[32]

Simonas Daukantas (1793 – 1864), who wrote the voluminous history of Lithuania in Lithuanian Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), and identified the language as the determining factor of nationality was rather critical regarding the Polish–Lithuanian union and considered it to be the cause of the Lithuanian state declining.
The gulf between those who chose to use Polish and those who chose to use Lithuanian was growing, and both groups began to see the very history of the Commonwealth in a different light.[31] Events such as the Polish-Lithuanian War, the 1919 Polish coup d'état attempt in Lithuania, and the conflict over Vilnius (Wilno) Region led to major tensions in the interwar Polish-Lithuanian relations.

It was a time of choosing citizenship based on person's values and language.[citation needed] The most iconic case is the family of Narutowicz (Narutavičius) – Stanislovas Narutavičius became one of the twenty signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania, while his brother Gabriel Narutowicz became the first president of Poland. A prominent Lithuanian zoologist and biologist, and one of the founders of Vytautas Magnus University Tadas Ivanauskas chose to be a Lithuanian, while his other two brothers – Jerzy and Stanisław became Polish and Vacłaŭ – Belarusian.

Tomas Venclova notes that the meaning of the terms: ""a Lithuanian"" and ""a Pole"" changed over the centuries.[33]

Polish-speaking Lithuanians often found it outrageous to be called 'Poles'. <...> As one Lithuanian 'Pole', Michal Juckniewicz, angrily told Lithuanian nationalists: ""Jagiełło, Chodkiewicz, Mickiewicz, Piłsudski and I – these are Lithuanians [using the word Litwini, the Polish word for Lithuanians] – and you; you are Lietuvisy [using a polonised form of the Lithuanian word for 'Lithuanians'][31]

Józef Piłsudski, an important interwar Polish politician, significantly responsible for Poland's regained independence in the aftermath of World War I, planner of the 1919 Polish coup d'état attempt in Lithuania[34] and orchestrator of the Żeligowski's Mutiny that brought the disputed Vilnius Region into Poland,[35] often drew attention to his Lithuanian ancestry, and briefly pursued the re-creation of the old Commonwealth.[36][37] In light of the other great plan for post-World War I order, the Bolshevik intention to spread the communist revolution through the Red Army, his goal of re-constituting the Commonwealth ""could only be achieved by war.""[38] Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. With the collapse of Russian and German occupying authorities, virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: Romania fought with Hungary over Transylvania, Yugoslavia with Italy over Rijeka, Poland with Czechoslovakia over Cieszyn Silesia, with Germany over Poznań, with Ukraine over Eastern Galicia, with Lithuania over Vilnius Region. Spreading Communist influences resulted in Communist revolutions in Munich, Berlin, Budapest and Prešov, and finally, in the Polish-Soviet War. Speaking of that period, Winston Churchill commented: ""The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies began.""[39] Eventually, the bad blood created but those conflicts, and the staunch opposition by (primarily) Polish and Lithuanian nationalists towards the federation idea, and finally the Peace of Riga, in which Poland abandoned the Belarusian and Ukrainian independence cause, would doom the idea of the Międzymorze federation.[40][41][42] The failure to create a strong counterbalance to Germany and Soviet Union, such as Międzymorze, which Piłsudski saw as a counterweight to Russian and German imperialism, according to some historians, doomed those countries to their eventual fate as victims of World War II.[43][44][45][46]

The Nobel Prize-winning poet Czesław Miłosz often wrote of his dual Polish and Lithuanian identities.[47] Anatol Lieven lists Miłosz among ""great Polish figures"", at the same time noting he is referred to as ""one of the last citizens of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania"", and that his use of the word ""Lithuanian"" was ""very different from the mono-ethnic vision of many Lithuanian nationalists"".[48] Miłosz himself compared the situation of Polish Lithuanians in the 19th century to that of educated Scots such as Walter Scott, whose works, while written in English rather than Gaelic, were centered on Scots characters and traditions.[49] Anatol Lieven makes a counterpoint by describing Scottish aspirations to independence as essentially crushed at the 1746 Battle of Culloden, which in his view made Scott's path less difficult, and sees pre-1939 Polish-Lithuanian culture as a combination of romantic idealization of medieval Lithuania and contempt for modern Lithuanians.[49] Similarly, he states: ""For educated Poles before the Second World War, Lithuania was not a nation but an assemblage of peasants speaking a peculiar dialect"", an attitude that further served to alienate the new Lithuanian intelligentsia.[49]
Czesław Miłosz wrote in his letter to Lithuanian poet Tomas Venclova, his long-time friend and associate during exile: ""There were some attacks against me in the Lithuanian émigré press because, even though I am a relative of Oscar Miłosz [a Lithuanian poet and diplomat], I am a Pole, not a Lithuanian.""[50] Despite this, radical Polish nationalists planned to protest Miłosz's funeral, claiming (among other reasons) that he was ""not Polish enough"", though the protest ultimately was not staged.[51][52]

The use of the expressions ""Polish-Lithuanian,"" ""Polonized Lithuanian,"" and ""Pole of Lithuanian descent"" persists in recent biographical descriptions of the Radziwiłł family[53] and in those of several notable 19th and 20th-century figures such as Emilia Plater, Józef Piłsudski, Adam Mickiewicz, Czesław Miłosz, and Gabriel Narutowicz, among others.[54][55][56][57] At the same time, other sources simply use the word ""Polish"",[58][59][60][61] just as the word ""Poland"" is used to refer to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth itself.[3] The usage of the term ""Polish"" transcends but does not replace the word ""Lithuanian"", as it was similar to the usage of the term ""British"" to refer to the British Commonwealth, comprising the English, Scottish and Welsh parts; however as a different term was not used in the English language, the result can be confusing at times.[3] An analogy has also been drawn between the use of Polish-Lithuanian and that of Anglo-Irish as adjectives.[17] Crucially, the pre-nationalistic usage of ""Polish-Lithuanian"" refers to (shared) culture, whereas the more modern, nationalistic usage of ""Polish"" and ""Lithuanian"" refers to ethnicity.[1]

Lithuania and Poland continue to dispute the origins of some cultural icons with roots in both cultures who are described in their national discourses as Polish-Lithuanian, as simply Polish, or as simply Lithuanian. The poet Adam Mickiewicz is an exemplar of the controversy.[62][63]

Today's Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the Commonwealth,[64] and stresses the common history of both nations,[65] whereas the Republic of Lithuania, re-established at the end of World War I, saw the participation of the Lithuanian state in the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth mostly in a negative light and idealized the pre-Commonwealth Duchy[31][66] although this attitude has been changing recently.[67] Modern Polish-Lithuanian relations have improved, but their respective views of history can still differ.[68]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Lithuanian_identity
Religion in Lithuania,"According to the Lithuanian census of 2021, the predominant religion in Lithuania is Christianity, with the largest confession being that of the Catholic Church (about 74% of the population).[1] There are smaller groups of Orthodox Christians, Evangelical Lutherans, members of Reformed churches, other Protestants, Jews and Muslims as well as people of other religions.

Lithuania is a secular state and its constitution guarantees freedom of religion and conscience. Christmas and Easter are recognised as national holidays.[2]

The first census in independent Lithuania, in 1923, established the following religious distribution: Catholic — 85.7 per cent; Jews — 7.7 per cent; Protestant — 3.8 per cent; Greek Orthodox — 2.7 per cent.[3]

Catholicism is the majority faith in Lithuania. As per 2001 Census, 79% of population followed Catholicism.[4] It decreased to 77% in 2011 Census[5] and further decreased to 74% in 2021 Census.[1] According to a 2016 survey, 70% of young adults said they were Catholic but only 5% go to mass weekly.[6]

As per the 2021 Census, the percentage of Catholics are highest (more than 90 %) in the municipalities of Šilalė district, Lazdijai district, Kalvarija and Rietavas and lowest in the Visaginas (24.7%).

About half of the Orthodox population lived in Visaginas (49.1%) and remaining in the cities of Klaipėda (13.1 %) and Vilnius (8.1 %). The Old Believers mostly live in Zarasai district (12.1 %) and Švenčionys district (5 %) municipalities.[7]

According to the 2021 Census, 85.2 % of Poles, 78.8 % of Lithuanians, 44 % of Belarusians, 15.3 % of Ukrainians are Catholics.

About 50.3 % of Russians, 49.3 % of Ukrainians, 29.8 % of Belarusians belongs to Orthodox community and about 10.6 % of Russians belongs to Old Believers community. Islam is followed mostly by Tatars, with  52.7 % following it. Judaism is followed by the ethnic Jew people (27.3 %). [7]

According to the 2021 census, 74% of Lithuanians belonged to the Catholic Church,[1] which has claimed the adherence of the majority of Lithuanians since the Christianization of Lithuania in the 14th and 15th centuries.[8] Lithuania kept its Catholic identity under the Russian Empire and later under the Soviet Union when some Catholic priests led the resistance against the Communist regime, which is commemorated in the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai, a shrine to the anti-communist resistance.

The center of Greek Catholic life in Lithuania is the Basilian Monastery and Church of the Holy Trinity in Vilnius. In the past, the monastery was multiethnic but now serves a mostly Ukrainian community.[9]

In the 16th century, Protestantism began spreading rapidly in Lithuania. The first wave of Protestantism was Lutheranism that reached Lithuania through Prussia; the second wave was Calvinism that mostly spread through Poland. This was because many Lithuanians had a relatively poor understanding of Catholic beliefs as there were few Lithuanian-speaking priests at the time. In addition, many sons of influential Lithuanian nobles would study abroad in Germany where they would learn about the ideas of Reformation. When they returned home, they would oftentimes use their right of patronage to confiscate Catholic churches and give them to pastors, convert their serfs either to Lutheranism or Calvinism. In 1536, the prevalence of Protestantism grew even more as Radziwiłł, Billewicz, Chodkiewicz families left the Roman Catholic Church. However, Protestantism in Lithuania Proper eventually lost ground as it failed to secure the support from the local clergymen and were at odds with one another, which weakened their positions in the country. There were also religious persecutions, which caused many Lithuanian pastors to flee to Lithuania Minor. Despite this, Protestantism remained to have a strong presence in Lithuania Proper until the late 17th century.[10]

Today Protestants are 0.8%, of which 0.6% are Lutheran and 0.2% are Reformed. According to Losch (1932), the Lutherans were 3.3% of the total population; they were mainly Germans in the Memel territory (now Klaipėda). There was also a tiny Reformed community (0.5%)[11] which still persists. Protestantism has declined with the removal of the German and Prussian Lithuanian populations, and today it is mainly represented by ethnic Lithuanians throughout the northern and western parts of the country, as well as large urban areas. Believers and clergy suffered greatly during the Soviet occupation, with many killed, tortured or deported to Siberia. Newly arriving evangelical churches have established missions in Lithuania since 1990.[12]

Protestants make up 0.8% of the population,[13] with 0.56% belonging to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Lithuania.

Lutheranism in Lithuania dates back to the 16th century, when it came mainly from the neighbouring German-controlled areas of Livonia and East Prussia. A Synod in Vilnius united the church in 1557. The parish network covered nearly all of the Grand Duchy, with district centers in Vilnius, Kedainai, Biržai, Slucke, Kojdanove and Zabludove later Izabeline. Small Protestant communities are dispersed throughout the northern and western parts of the country.

The majority of Prussian Lithuanians living in East Prussia and in Memelland (since 1945 the Klaipėda Region of Lithuania) belonged to the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union. Most resettled in the West Germany after World War II along with the ethnic German inhabitants.

Since 1945, Lutheranism in Lithuania has declined largely due to the ongoing secularization that sweeps throughout Europe.

The Lithuanian Evangelical Reformed Church is a historic denomination which was founded in 1557. A notable member was Szymon Zajcusz. In the second half of the 16th century the Unitarians separated. The denomination has over 7,000 members in 14 congregations. The church is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches[14] and the World Reformed Fellowship[15]

Various Protestant churches have established missions in Lithuania since 1990, including the United Methodists,[16] the Baptist Union,[17] the Mennonites,[18] and World Venture.[19]

Eastern Orthodoxy claims 4.1% of the population, mainly from the Russian minority.[13]  Orthodox Christianity is the first form of Christianity to arrive in Lithuania, with the marriage of Algirdas to Maria of Vitebsk and the martyrdom of Ss. Anthony, John, and Eustathius of Vilnius.  The church founded by Maria of Vitebsk, St. Paraskevi Church, is the oldest continuously existing Christian congregation in the country.

Since the 19th century, the Russian Orthodox Church has been represented by a diocese in the country. In March 2023, Patriarch Bartholomew announced his intention to form a church structure under the Ecumenical Patriarchate, following a meeting with Ingrida Šimonytė.[20]

Most of the Armenians in Lithuania, making up about 0.1% of population according to its own estimates, belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is often classified as an Oriental Orthodox Church, in distinction from Eastern Orthodox (to which the main Russian, Greek and Georgian Churches belong).

An Armenian Apostolic Church dedicated to St. Vardan was opened in Vilnius in 2006.[21]

In Lithuania, Islam has a long history unlike in many other northern European countries. The medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth allowed Muslims, notably the Crimean Tatars to settle in the lands in the south.[22] Some of people from those lands were moved into ethnically Lithuanian lands, now the current Republic of Lithuania, mainly under the rule of Grand Duke Vytautas. The Tatars, now referred to as Lithuanian Tatars, lost their language over time and now speak Lithuanian as natives; however, they have strongly maintained their Muslim faith.

The Lithuanian Jewish community has roots that go back to before the time of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuania was historically home to a large Jewish community and an important center of Jewish scholarship and culture from the 18th century until the community was almost entirely eliminated during the Holocaust. Before World War II, the Lithuanian Jewish population numbered some 160,000, about 7% of the total population.[23] Vilnius alone had a Jewish community of nearly 100,000, about 45% of the city's total population[24] with over 110 synagogues and 10 yeshivot in the city.[25]

There are communities of Jews of Lithuanian descent around the world, especially in Israel, the United States, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Brazil and Australia.

According to the 2001 census, there were 1,272 adherents of Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism.[26] About 4,000 Jews were counted in Lithuania during the 2005 census.[27]

According to a Karaite tradition, several hundred Crimean Karaites were invited to Lithuania by Grand Duke Vytautas to settle in Trakai ca. 1397. A small community remains in Trakai, which has preserved the Turkic Karaim language and distinctive customs, such as its traditional dish called ""kibinai"", a sort of meat pastry, and its houses with three windows, one for God, one for the family and one for Grand Duke Vytautas.

Medieval Lithuania was the last pagan nation in Europe, officially converting in the late 14th century. The neo-pagan movement Romuva, established in 1967, attempts to reconstruct and revive Lithuanian ethnic religion.[28]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Lithuania
Lithuania–Russia relations,"Lithuania–Russia relations or the Russo-Lithuanian relations are the bilateral relations between the Republic of Lithuania and the Russian Federation. They have been marked by a long and turbulent history dating back to the Middle Ages. The modern-day relations have been mostly hostile. The two countries share a common border through Kaliningrad Oblast. Lithuania has an embassy in Moscow with consulates in Kaliningrad and in Sovetsk, whereas Russia has an embassy in Vilnius.

Despite today's difference in population and area between the countries, Lithuania (also as part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and Russia (including its predecessor Principality of Moscow) were more equal regional powers in the past, competing for supremacy in Eastern Europe. The two states fought numerous wars, with Lithuania controlling sizeable parts of modern-day Russia in the Late Middle Ages, and Russia controlling the bulk of Lithuania in the late modern period.

In response to 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Bucha massacre, in April 2022, Lithuania downgraded the diplomatic relations and expelled the Russian ambassador.[1] As of 2022, the relations between the countries have been reduced to the bare minimum.[2]

The origins of the relations between contemporary Lithuania and Russia can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania came into contact with the Principality of Moscow.[3] The rivalry between the Lithuanian dukes and Muscovite princes began in the first half of the 14th century and soon resulted in Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–1372).[4]
In this conflict, the Principality of Tver sided with Lithuania.[4] The conflict resumed again in the 15th century, as the rulers of both powers had aspirations to seize the territories of the former Kievan Rus', resulting in a number of campaigns, territorial changes, complex alliances and regional rulers changing sides.[4] On 31 August 1449, Casimir IV Jagiellon and Vasily II of Moscow signed the first treaty between Lithuania and Muscovy, referred to as the Treaty of Eternal Peace (1449).[5] The wars continued in 1487–1494, 1500–1503 and 1512–1522 with a number of truce and peace treaties signed in this period.[5] In the early 16th century, Lithuania lost the eastern cities of Bryansk, Kursk and Smolensk to Muscovy.

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania co-formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Meanwhile, Ivan IV seized the territories in the north and, in 1547, consolidated them under the Tsardom of Russia. Both states continued to have wars, either directly or within alliances, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Following the Great Northern War, which involved many European powers, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth began to decline and was eventually partitioned by the neighbouring powers. After the third partition in 1795, the bulk of the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was taken over by the Russian Empire.[6] The new provinces were often called ""Lithuanian"", but in 1840, Nicholas I prohibited the use of the name.[7] There were two major rebellions against the Russian rule, the November Uprising of 1830 and the January Uprising of 1863, but they failed to restore the Polish–Lithuanian state.[8][9]

During the 1905 Russian Revolution, a large congress of Lithuanian representatives in the Great Seimas of Vilnius demanded a wide political autonomy for Lithuania (by which they meant the northwestern portion of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania)[10] on 5 December of that year. The tsarist regime made a number of concessions as the result of the 1905 uprising. The Baltic states once again were permitted to use their native languages in schooling and public discourse, and Catholic churches were again built in Lithuania. Latin alphabet was restored after a period of the Lithuanian press ban. However, even Russian liberals were not prepared to concede autonomy similar to the degree it already existed in Estonia and Latvia, albeit under Baltic German hegemony. Many Baltic Germans looked toward aligning the Baltics (Lithuania and Courland in particular) with Germany.[11]

After the outbreak of hostilities in World War I, Germany occupied Lithuania and Courland in 1915. Vilnius fell to the Germans on 19 September 1915 and Lithuania was incorporated into Ober Ost under a German government of occupation.[12] As open annexation could result in a public-relations backlash, the Germans planned to form a network of formally independent states that would in fact be dependent on Germany.[13] However, the defeat of Germany in World War I and the October Revolution in Russia created an opportunity for the Lithuanian leaders to organize the Vilnius Conference and begin the process of reestablishing a fully independent Lithuanian state.[14] On 18 February 1918, the Council of Lithuania signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania, proclaiming the Republic of Lithuania.

During the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–19, which followed the retreating German troops, a Lithuanian–Soviet War was fought between the newly independent Lithuania and the Soviet Russia. At the same time, the Soviet Russia created short-lived puppet states: Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic which was soon merged into the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. However, the Soviet military campaign was unsuccessful and the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed on 12 July 1920. In the treaty, the Soviet Russia recognized fully independent Lithuania, including its claims to the disputed Vilnius Region.[15]

Following the peace treaty with Soviet Russia, Lithuania secretly allowed the Soviet forces a passage through its territory as they moved against Poland.[15] On 14 July 1920, the advancing Soviet army captured Vilnius and returned it to Lithuanians, but on 26 August 1920 the city was again captured by the Polish army which defeated the Soviets. To prevent further fighting, the Suwałki Agreement was signed by Poland and Lithuania on 7 October 1920; it left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side of the armistice line.[16] It never went into effect, however, because Polish General Lucjan Żeligowski, acting on Józef Piłsudski's orders, staged the Żeligowski's Mutiny: a military offensive presented as a mutiny.[16] He invaded Lithuania on 8 October 1920, captured Vilnius the following day, and established a short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania in eastern Lithuania on 12 October 1920. The ""Republic"" was a part of Piłsudski's federalist scheme, which never materialized due to opposition from both the Polish and Lithuanian nationalists.[16]

On 30 December 1922, Soviet Russia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and the latter state inherited the Lithuania–Russia relations.

The Third Seimas of Lithuania was elected in May 1926. For the first time, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party lost their majority and went into opposition. It was sharply criticized for signing the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact, even though it affirmed Soviet recognition of Lithuanian claims to Poland-held Vilnius.[17]

At the beginning of World War II, when the Soviet Union invaded Poland, Soviet troops took over Vilnius Region. The region belonged to Interwar Poland, but according to the 1920 Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and later treaties it was recognized to Lithuania.[18] As a result, Soviets and Germans re-negotiated the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On 28 September 1939, they signed the Boundary and Friendship Treaty.[19] Its secret attachment detailed that to compensate the Soviet Union for German-occupied Polish territories, Germany would transfer Lithuania, except for a small territory in Suvalkija, to the Soviet sphere of influence.[20] The exchange of territories was also motivated by Soviet control of Vilnius: the Soviet Union could exert significant influence on the Lithuanian government, which claimed Vilnius to be its de jure capital.[21] In the secret protocols, both Soviet Union and Germany explicitly recognized Lithuanian interest in Vilnius.[22] Accordingly, by the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of 10 October 1939, Lithuania would acquire about one fifth of the Vilnius Region, including Lithuania's historical capital, Vilnius, and in exchange would allow five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops to be established across Lithuania.[citation needed]

After months of intense propaganda and diplomatic pressure, the Soviets issued an ultimatum on 14 June 1940.[23] Soviets accused Lithuania of violating the treaty and abducting Russian soldiers from their bases.[20] Soviets demanded that a new government, which would comply with the Mutual Assistance Treaty, would be formed and that an unspecified number of Soviet troops would be admitted to Lithuania.[24] With Soviet troops already in the country, it was impossible to mount military resistance.[23] Soviets took control of government institutions, installed a new pro-Soviet puppet government, and announced elections to the People's Seimas. Following the sham election, the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the Soviet Union on 3 August 1940.[25] One local Communist party emerged from underground with 1500 members in Lithuania.[26]

In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army reached eastern Lithuania.[27] By July 1944, the area around Vilnius came under control of the Polish Resistance fighters of the Armia Krajowa, who also attempted a takeover of the German-held city during the ill-fated Operation Ostra Brama.[28] The Red Army captured Vilnius with Polish help on 13 July.[28] The Soviet Union re-occupied Lithuania and Joseph Stalin re-established the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1944 with its capital in Vilnius.[28] The Soviets secured the passive agreement of the United States and Great Britain (see Yalta Conference and Potsdam Agreement) to this annexation. By January 1945, the Soviet forces captured Klaipėda on the Baltic coast. The heaviest physical losses in Lithuania during World War II were suffered in 1944–45, when the Red Army pushed out the Nazi invaders.[29] It is estimated that Lithuania lost 780,000 people between 1940 and 1954 under the Nazi and Soviet occupations.[30]

After Stalin's death in 1953, the deportees were slowly and gradually released. The last deportees were released only in 1963. Some 60,000 managed to return to Lithuania, while 30,000 were prohibited from settling back in their homeland. Soviet authorities encouraged the immigration of non-Lithuanian workers, especially Russians, as a way of integrating Lithuania into the Soviet Union and encouraging industrial development,[30] but in Lithuania this process did not assume the massive scale experienced by other European Soviet republics.[31]

As allies of the Soviet Union during World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom recognized the occupation of the Republic of Lithuania at Yalta Conference in 1945 de facto. However, the US, UK her Western governments did not recognize the seizure of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in 1940 and in 1944 de jure according to the Welles Declaration of 23 July 1940.[32] As a result of this doctrine, most Western countries continue to recognize Lithuania as an independent, sovereign de jure state subject to international law represented by the legations appointed by the pre-1940 state which functioned through the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service.

During the occupation of Lithuania, at least 130,000 people, 70% of them women and children,[33] were forcibly transported to labor camps and other forced settlements in remote parts of the Soviet Union, such as the Irkutsk Oblast and Krasnoyarsk Krai. Among the deportees were about 4,500 Poles.[34] These deportations did not include Lithuanian partisans or political prisoners (approximately 150,000 people) deported to Gulag forced labor camps.[35] Deportations of the civilians served a double purpose: repressing resistance to Sovietization policies in Lithuania and providing free labor in sparsely inhabited areas of the Soviet Union. Approximately 28,000 of Lithuanian deportees died in exile due to poor living conditions.[citation needed]

In 1956 and 1957, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved releases of larger groups of the deportees, including the Lithuanians. Deportees started returning in large numbers creating difficulties for local communists – deportees would petition for return of their confiscated property, were generally considered unreliable and required special surveillance. Soviet Lithuanian officials, including Antanas Sniečkus, drafted local administrative measures prohibiting deportee return and petitioned Moscow to enact national policies to that effect.[36] In May 1958, the Soviet Union revised its policy regarding the remaining deportees: all those who were not involved with the Lithuanian partisans were released, but without the right to return to Lithuania.[37] The last Lithuanians—the partisan relatives and the partisans—were released only in 1960 and 1963 respectively.[38] Majority of the deportees released in May 1958 and later never returned to Lithuania.[39]

About 60,000 deportees returned to Lithuania.[40] Upon return, they faced further difficulties: their property was long looted and divided up by strangers, they faced discrimination for jobs and social guarantees, their children were denied higher education. Former deportees, resistance members, and their children were not allowed to integrate into the society. That created a permanent group of people that opposed the regime and continued non-violent resistance.[41]

Lithuania declared sovereignty on its territory on 18 May 1989 and restored independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990 as the Republic of Lithuania. It was the first Soviet republic to do so. All legal ties of the Soviet Union's sovereignty over the republic were cut as Lithuania declared the restitution of its independence. The Soviet Union claimed that this declaration was illegal, suggesting that Lithuania had to follow the process of secession mandated in the Soviet Constitution. Lithuania claimed that the Soviet annexation itself was illegal and claimed state continuity. In January 1991, during the January Events, Soviet military attempted to crack down on the Lithuanian independence, killing 14 civilians and injuring over 140.[42][43] 14 civilians were killed and over 140 were injured.[44] Following the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, most countries recognized the Lithuanian independence, and the Soviet Union itself did that on 6 September 1991.

On 27 July 1991, the Russian government re-recognized Lithuania and the two countries re-established diplomatic relations on 9 October 1991. President Boris Yeltsin and the Chairman of the Supreme Council Vytautas Landsbergis met to discuss economic ties. The Russian troops stayed in Lithuania for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993.[citation needed] Since the reestablishment of independence, only two Lithuanian leaders have visited Moscow: one by Algirdas Brazauskas in 1997 and Valdas Adamkus in 2001 and 2005.[45][46][47] A planned 1999 trip to Moscow was reportedly canceled due to Boris Yeltsin's illness.[48] The first telephone conversation took place between Dalia Grybauskaitė and Dmitry Medvedev in 2009.[49]

Following Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, concerns about the geopolitical environment led Lithuania to begin preparing for a possibility of a military conflict with Russia. In December 2014, Russia carried out a military drill in nearby Kaliningrad with 55 naval vessels and 9,000 soldiers.[50] In 2015, Lithuanian Chief of Defence Jonas Vytautas Žukas announced plans to reinstate conscription, which had previously ended in 2008, to bolster the ranks of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The plan succeeded, while the vast majority are voluntary, with only about 10% by today (as of late 2010s) being drawn from compulsory conscription involuntarily. [51] The Ministry of National Defence also published a 98-page manual for citizens to prepare them for a possibility of armed conflict or occupation.[52] In 2017, NATO Enhanced Forward Presence was deployed to Lithuania and other NATO members in the eastern flank.[53]

Following the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania has strongly condemned the invasion and called for military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.[54] President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda declared a state of emergency on 24 February 2022. On the same day, Lithuania also requested NATO to activate the Article 4 on joint consultations.[55]

Together with the other EU member states, Lithuania banned Russian language media channels and imposed sanctions on Russia, and Russia, in turn, added all EU countries to the list of ""unfriendly nations"".[56] Soon after Lithuania expelled four Russian diplomats.[57] On 4 April, in response to the Bucha massacre, Lithuania expelled the Russian ambassador and closed the consulate in Klaipėda.[1] In April 2022, the Russian government decided to withdraw its consent to the functioning of the Consulate-General of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg.[58]

On 10 May, Lithuania's Seimas voted unanimously to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine as constituting terrorism and genocide. The motion described Russia's war crimes in Ukraine as including ""deliberate killing of civilians, mass rape, forcible relocation of Ukrainian citizens to Russia and the destruction of economic infrastructure and cultural sites"". The motion claimed that Russian forces were targeting Ukrainian civilian sites for bombing and described Russia as a state which ""supports and perpetrates terrorism"".[59] In response to the resolution, Leonid Slutsky stated that the resolution was part of an ""anti-Russia project"", accused Lithuania of Russophobia and said that ""the level of relations with Lithuania has already been lowered significantly"".[60]

On 8 June 2022 Russian parliamentarian Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov submitted a bill to the Duma to repeal the recognition by the Russian state of Lithuania's independence.[61] He thought that in this way the other two Baltic states might have their independence reversed too. An academic from the Institute of Commonwealth of Independent States brought up several expansionist devices and suggested that the Baltic States were ""making the same mistake as Ukraine, which believed that the Russian Federation would never send troops because the United States was behind it.""[62] Towards the end of June, Lithuania announced that it would be blocking the transport of Russian goods through their territory from mainland Russia to Kaliningrad. Russia criticised Lithuania for this.[63]

In September 2022, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have decided to close entry for the Russian citizens with Schengen visas, including those issued by third countries.[64] In 2022, around 4,000 Russian citizens applied for a residence permit in Lithuania, while 38 had their permanent residence permit revoked over security concerns.[65]

In December 2022, diplomatic relations between Lithuania and Russia were downgraded to the level of acting chargé d'affaires after the Russian ambassador was expelled and the Lithuanian ambassador recalled.[66]

In August 2023, following a survey, Lithuania announced that 254 Russian and 910 Belarusian citizens living in Lithuania posed a threat to national security and that their residence permits will be revoked.[67][68]

In September 2023, following the new explanation of the EU sanctions by the European Commission, Lithuania together with the other Baltic States and Finland banned the vehicles with the Russian license plates from entering their territory.[69][70]

In October 2024, Lithuania denounced several treaties with Russia and Belarus, including a treaty on double taxation of income and a treaty on legal assistance.[71]

In 2021 Russia exported $4.56 billion of goods to Lithuania with crude oil, the main product. Exports from Lithuania were $4.14 billion with wine being the top product. From 1995 to 2021 Russian exports have risen by 6.04% p.a. with Lithuanian exports rising at 8.06% on average.[72]

Teodor Narbutt,"Teodor Narbutt (Lithuanian: Teodoras Narbutas; 8 November 1784 – 27 November 1864) was a Polish–Lithuanian romantic historian and military engineer in service of the Russian Empire. He is best remembered as the author of a nine-volume Polish-language history of Lithuania from the early Middle Ages to the Union of Lublin.[1]

Teodor Narbutt was born in 1784 in the village of Szawry (present-day Voranava District of Belarus) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, to a notable szlachta family of Trąby coat of arms. Early in his youth his fatherland was partitioned between Russia, Austria and Prussia. After graduating from a Piarist college at Lyubeshiv, Narbutt entered the Vilna Academy, where in 1803 he graduated in engineering. He then moved to Saint Petersburg, where he joined the Cadet Corps. He served in the Imperial Russian Army, where he became a captain in the field engineering corps. He took part in the 1807 and 1812 Russian campaigns against Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1809 he constructed the Bobruysk fortress (modern Babruysk, Belarus), for which he was awarded the Order of Saint Anna.

At the same time, in 1813 he became interested in archaeology and started to organize numerous excavations across the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. His passion for history, culture and folklore of the lands of the former Grand Duchy was first shown after 1817, at which date he started to write historical articles for various Vilna-based newspapers. He also started to collect copies of documents related to the ancient history of Lithuania, which were published in 1846 in an anthology Pomniki do dziejów litewskich (Monuments of Lithuanian History). Among the most notable primary sources he published was the 16th-century (?) Letopis of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, also known as the Bychowiec Chronicle, after its founder Aleksander Bychowiec.

Between 1835 and 1841 he published a monumental, 9-volume history of Lithuania, covering the period from the prehistoric times to the Union of Lublin. Although largely based on folk tales, dubious and often falsified sources, the book had a tremendous impact on both historiography of Lithuania, and later on Lithuanian National Revival. Its Lithuanian translation became the first history of Lithuania written entirely from a Lithuanian perspective. Paradoxically, the book underlined the Ruthenian past of Lithuania, and as such was highly acclaimed by Russian historians and authorities alike. For it, Narbutt was awarded by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia a gold ring set with a ruby, the Order of Saint Anne and the Order of Saint Vladimir. In 1856, Narbutt published yet another collection of texts, comprising original primary sources and his own forgeries. Among the most popular of the latter was von Kyburg's Diary, a fabricated account of Lithuania in the 13th century.

Throughout his life, Narbutt remained an active member of the Archaeological Commission of Vilna, as well as a notable engineer. Between 1847 and 1852 he constructed a parish church in Eišiškės (Ejszyszki in Polish), now Lithuania. Although loyal to Imperial Russia, the anti-Russian January Uprising brought an end to his family. His wife, Krystyna Narbutt née Sadowska was sentenced to forced resettlement to Siberia and was not allowed to return until 1871. His older son, Ludwik Narbutt, became a notable commander of the Polish-Lithuanian forces in the area of Lida and was killed in 1863 in a fight against the Russians.[2] The younger son Bolesław was sentenced to death by the Russian authorities, but his sentence was later changed to life imprisonment because of his young age. Narbutt's only daughter Teodora had to flee the country and was sentenced to forced labour in absentia. Narbutt himself died in 1864 in Vilnius.

Narbutt had no education in history and is infamous for his uncritical, amateurish approach to historical sources. In the absence of written sources, he often used dubious sources and his own imagination. Some historians believe him to be of good intentions if naive,[3] while others accuse him of actively creating forgeries. In particular, historians identified these sources, discovered and published by Narbutt, as possible forgeries:[4]

At least one of his published sources earlier suspected to be a forgery, namely the Bychowiec Chronicle, was conclusively proven to be authentic and a highly valuable historical source.

Narbutt's nine-volume history of Lithuania (1835–1841) is the first work to separate the history of Lithuania from that of Poland. The work ends with the Union of Lublin (1569) and the death of King Sigismund Augustus (1572), because Narbutt believed that Lithuanian history ended with the formation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Augustus, the last ruler of the Gediminian-Jagiellonian dynasty.[10] There are a number of historical inaccuracies in his books, for example, Narbutt propagated the legend of Lithuanian lineage from the Romans (see: Palemonids). Narbutt was preparing a corrected second edition at the time of his death, only the summary of the Lithuanian history was published: Dzieje narodu litewskiego w krótkości zebrane (1847).

Both of these studies are critically regarded by historians because of historical inaccuracies, but Lithuanians in the 19th century, during an era of the rising national consciousness, welcomed every opportunity to derive patriotic inspiration from the past. Narbutt maintained contact with the leading Lithuanian activists of his day and corresponded extensively with Simonas Daukantas, who in the same romantic spirit wrote the first Lithuanian-language history of Lithuania.[10]

His lack of critical judgement in differentiating between authentic and spurious sources lessened the value of his work today, but his contributions remain very important to Lithuanian history. Narbutt revealed many unknown historical sources, the most famous being the Bychowiec Chronicle. It is the most comprehensive version of the Lithuanian chronicles, compiled from manuscripts dating from the first half of the 16th century. He has also collected and made copies of many original manuscripts, which have provided sources for historical studies later.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teodor_Narbutt
Misnagdim,"Misnagdim (מתנגדים‎, ""Opponents""; Sephardi pronunciation: Mitnagdim; singular misnaged / mitnaged) was a religious movement among the Jews of Eastern Europe which resisted the rise of Hasidism in the 18th and 19th centuries.[1][2][3] The Misnagdim were particularly concentrated in Lithuania, where Vilnius served as the bastion of the movement, but anti-Hasidic activity was undertaken by the establishment in many locales. The most severe clashes between the factions took place in the latter third of the 18th century; the failure to contain Hasidism led the Misnagdim to develop distinct religious philosophies and communal institutions, which were not merely a perpetuation of the old status quo but often innovative. The most notable results of these efforts, pioneered by Chaim of Volozhin and continued by his disciples, were the modern, independent yeshiva and the Musar movement. Since the late 19th century, tensions with the Hasidim largely subsided, and the heirs of Misnagdim adopted the epithet Litvishe or Litvaks.

The rapid spread of Hasidism in the second half of the 18th century greatly troubled many traditional rabbis; many saw it as heretical. Much of Judaism was still fearful of the messianic movements of the Sabbateans and the Frankists, the followers of the messianic claimants Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791), respectively. Many rabbis suspected Hasidism of an intimate connection with these movements.

Hasidism's founder was Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer (c. 1700 – 1760), known as the Baal Shem Tov (""master of the good name""; usually applied to a saintly Jew who was also a wonder-worker), or simply by the acronym Besht (Hebrew: בעש""ט); he taught that man's relationship with God depended on immediate religious experience, in addition to knowledge and observance of the details of the Torah and Talmud.

The characteristically misnagdic approach to Judaism was marked by a concentration on highly intellectual Talmud study; however, it by no means rejected mysticism.[4] The movement's leaders, like the Gaon of Vilna and Chaim of Volozhin, were deeply immersed in kabbalah.[2] Their difference with the Hasidim was their opposition to involving mystical teachings and considerations in the public life, outside the elitist circles which studied and practiced kabbalah. The Hasidic leaders' inclination to rule in legal matters, binding for the whole community (as opposed to strictures voluntarily adopted by the few), based on mystical considerations, greatly angered the Misnagdim.[5] On another theoretical level, Chaim of Volozhin and his disciples did not share Hasidism's basic notion that man could grasp the immanence of God's presence in the created universe, thus being able to transcend ordinary reality and potentially infuse everyday actions with spiritual meaning. However, Volozhin's exact position on the issue is subject to debate among researchers. Some believe the differences between the two schools of thought were almost semantic, while others regard their understanding of key doctrines as starkly different.[6]

Lithuania became the heartland of the traditionalist opposition to Hasidism, so ""Lithuanian"" and ""misnaged"" became virtually interchangeable terms in popular perception. However, a sizable minority of Greater Lithuanian Jews belong(ed) to Hasidic groups, including Chabad, Slonim, Karlin-Stolin (Pinsk), Amdur and Koidanov.

The first documented opposition to the Hasidic movement was from the Jewish community in Shklow, Lithuania, in 1772. Rabbis and community leaders voiced concerns about the Hasidim because they were going to Lithuania. The rabbis sent letters forbidding Hasidic prayer houses, urging the burning of Hasidic texts, and humiliating prominent Hasidic leaders. The rabbis imprisoned the Hasidic leaders in an attempt to isolate them from coming into contact with their followers.[7]

The excommunications against Hasidic Jews in 1772 was accompanied by the public destruction of early Hasidic pamphlets. The Vilna Gaon, Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, a prominent rabbi, galvanized opposition to Hasidic Judaism.[8][9] He believed that the claims of miracles and visions made by Hasidic Jews were lies and delusions. A key point of opposition was that the Vilna Gaon maintained that greatness in Torah and Jewish religious observance must come through natural human efforts at Torah study without relying on any external ""miracles"" and ""wonders"". On the other hand, the Ba'al Shem Tov was focused on the emotional uplift of the Jewish people—especially following the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648 – 1654) and the aftermath and disillusionment of the failed messiahships of Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank.[10] Opponents of Hasidism held that its followers viewed their rebbes idolatrously, if not as explicitly divine.

The Vilna Gaon expressed his disapproval of synagogues in which business was discussed and atheism openly believed, viewing them as disrespectful to sacred spaces. Other Jewish leaders criticized those claiming to be rabbis who did not honor Shabbat and mitzvot. Despite this, the Gaon encouraged the study of non-Jewish wisdom and opposed the assimilation of the Haskalah, aiming to enhance the spread of the Torah. It was noted that some who sought the role of rabbi did so out of a desire for power and recognition, a point often criticized in early Hasidism for lacking genuine pursuit of studying Torah for its own sake.

The Chabad-Lubavitch cannot help but recognize in the Vilna Gaon a true Jewish Chakham sage:[11]

Rabbi Moshe Meisels was originally a disciple of Rabbi Eliyahu, the Gaon of Vilna, and a member of the opposition to the Chassidic movement. He later became a devoted chassid of Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi, and, after the latter's passing, of Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch and of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Lubavitch. Rabbi Moshe served as the leader of the Chassidic community in Vilna until 1816 when he made aliyah (""ascent"") to the Holy Land and settled in Hebron, where he passed away in 1849[12]

Most of the changes made by the Hasidim were the product of the Hasidic approach to Kabbalah, mainly as expressed by Isaac Luria (1534 – 1572) and his disciples—particularly Hayyim ben Joseph Vital (1543–1620). Luria greatly influenced both misnagdim and Hasidim, but the former feared what they perceived as disturbing parallels in Hasidism to the heretical Sabbateans. An example of such an idea was that God entirely nullifies the universe. Depending on how this idea was preached and interpreted, it could give rise to pantheism, universally acknowledged as heresy, or lead to immoral behavior since elements of Kabbalah can be misconstrued to de-emphasize ritual and glorify sexual metaphors as a more profound means of grasping some inner hidden notions in the Torah based on the Jews' intimate relationship with God. If God is present in everything, and if divinity is to be grasped in erotic terms, then—Misnagdim feared—Hasidim might feel justified in neglecting legal distinctions between the holy and the profane, and in engaging in inappropriate sexual activities.[citation needed]

The Misnagdim were seen as using yeshivas and scholarship as the learning center. At the same time, Hasidic learning centered around the rebbe, which was tied in with what they considered emotional displays of piety.[4]

The stress of Jewish prayer over Torah study and the Hasidic reinterpretation of Torah l'shma (Torah study for its own sake) was seen as a rejection of traditional Judaism.

Hasidim did not follow the traditional Ashkenazi prayer rite and instead used a combination of Ashkenazi and Sephardi rites and Lurianic Kabbalistic concepts known as Nusach Sefard. This was seen as a rejection of the traditional liturgy and, due to the resulting need for separate synagogues, a breach of communal unity. In addition, they faced criticism for neglecting the halakhic times for prayer.[8]

Hasidic Jews also added some halakhic stringencies to kashrut, the laws of keeping kosher.[citation needed] They made specific changes in how livestock was slaughtered and in who was considered a reliable mashgiach (a legal supervisor of kashrut). The result was that they essentially did not accept as kosher certain foods that were accepted as kosher by Misnagdim. This was seen as a change of traditional Judaism, an over-stringency of Halakha, and, again, a breach of communal unity.

With the rise of what would become known as Hasidism in the late 18th century, established conservative rabbinic authorities actively worked to stem its growth. Whereas before the breakaway Hasidic synagogues were occasionally opposed but largely checked, its spread into Lithuania and Belarus prompted a concerted effort by opposing rabbis to halt its spread.[7]

In late 1772, after uniting the scholars of Brisk, Minsk and other Belarusian and Lithuanian communities, the Vilna Gaon then issued the first of many polemical letters against the nascent Hasidic movement, which was included in the anti-Hasidic anthology, Zemir aritsim ve-ḥarvot tsurim (1772). The letters published in the anthology included pronouncements of excommunication against Hasidic leaders on the basis of their worship and habits, all of which were seen as unorthodox by the Misnagdim. This included but was not limited to unsanctioned places of worship and ecstatic prayers, as well as charges of smoking, dancing, and the drinking of alcohol. In total, this was seen to be a radical departure from the Misnagdic norm of asceticism, scholarship, and stoic demeanor in worship and general conduct, and was viewed as a development that needed to be suppressed.[7]

Between 1772 and 1791, other Misnagdic tracts of this type would follow, all targeting the Hasidim in an effort to contain and eradicate them from Jewish communities. The harshest of these denouncements came between 1785 and 1815 combined with petitioning of the Russian government to outlaw the Hasidim on the grounds of their being spies, traitors, and subversives.[7]

However, this would not be realized. After the death of the Vilna Gaon in 1797 and the partitions of Poland in 1793 and 1795, the regions of Poland where there were disputes between Misnagdim and Hasidim came under the control of governments that did not want to take sides in intra-Jewish conflicts, but that wanted instead to abolish Jewish autonomy. In 1804 Hasidism was legalized by the Imperial Russian government, and efforts by the Misnagdim to contain the now-widespread Hasidim were stymied.[7]

By the mid-19th century, most non-Hasidic Judaism had discontinued its struggle with Hasidism and reconciled itself to establishing the latter as a fact. One reason for the reconciliation between the Hasidim and the Misnagdim was the rise of the Haskalah movement. While many followers of this movement were observant, it was also used by the absolutist state to change Jewish education and culture, which both Misnagdim and Hasidim perceived as a greater threat to religion than they represented to each other.[13][14] In the modern era, Misnagdim evolved into ""Litvishe"" or ""Yeshivish.""

Litvishe is a Yiddish word that refers to Haredi Jews who are not Hasidim (and not Hardalim or Sephardic Haredim). It literally means Lithuanian. While Litvishe functions as an adjective, the plural noun form often used is Litvaks. The Hebrew plural noun form which is used with the same meaning is Lita'im. Other expressions are Yeshivishe and Misnagdim. It has been equated with the term ""Yeshiva world"".[15]

The words Litvishe, Lita'im, and Litvaks are all somewhat misleading, because there are also Hasidic Jews from Lithuania, and many Lithuanian Jews who are not Haredi.

Litvishe Jews largely identify with the Misnagdim, who ""objected to what they saw as Hasidic denigration of Torah study and normative Jewish law in favor of undue emphasis on emotionality and religious fellowship as pathways to the Divine.""[16] The term Misnagdim (""opponents"") is somewhat outdated since the former opposition between the two groups has lost much of its salience, so the other terms are more common.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misnagdim
1940 Lithuanian parliamentary election,"Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 14–15 July 1940 to the People's Seimas. They followed an ultimatum from the Soviet Union to allow Soviet troops to enter the country and operate freely.[1] The elections were rigged and only communist candidates were allowed to run.[2]

Following the Soviet invasion in June 1940, the Red Army occupied the country and took control of the government.[1] President Antanas Smetona left Lithuania on 15 June.[1]

On 1 July the puppet People's Government led by Justas Paleckis announced elections to a new parliament, the People's Seimas, to be held on 14 July. The Communist Party of Lithuania emerged from underground with 1,500 members.[3] Soon afterwards, the government announced the formation of the Union of the Working People of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos liaudies darbo sąjunga), ostensibly a popular front. Voters were presented with a single list of candidates, including some non-communists. Just one candidate was presented for every seat in the new parliament and no other organizations were allowed to participate. On 11 and 12 July, the Soviet authorities stifled the opposition by arresting leading figures of the previous government and deporting some of them to the interior of the Soviet Union – even though Lithuania was still formally an independent state. The elections were later extended into 15 July. Each voter had his or her passport stamped after voting. According to the official results, voter turnout reached 95% and the Union list received over 99% of the votes. Most of the original election records were destroyed. The remaining data shows that turnout was indeed high, but that many ballots were invalid (missing, destroyed, left blank, or marked with anti-Soviet slogans). The results were announced even before the polls closed.

The new parliament was convened on 21 July and voted unanimously to established the Lithuanian SSR and request to join the Soviet Union.[1] The country became the Soviet Union's fourteenth member on 3 August.[1]

The event is seen by Lithuania as a sham election used to justify the occupation.[2] The United States and most other Western countries never recognised the subsequent Soviet annexation, considering it illegal.[4][5]

Prime Minister of Lithuania,"The prime minister of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Ministras Pirmininkas, lit. 'Minister-Chairman', colloquially also referred to as the premier Lithuanian: premjeras) is the head of government of Lithuania. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the assent of the Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas. The modern office of prime minister was established in 1990, when Lithuania declared its independence, although the official title was ""Chairperson of the Council of Ministers"" until 25 November 1992.

Historically, the title of prime minister was also used between 1918 and 1940. This was during the original Republic of Lithuania, which lasted from the collapse of the Russian Empire until the country's annexation by the Soviet Union.

Following the ultimatum in June 1940, the forces of Soviet Union entered Lithuania, prompting President Antanas Smetona to flee the country. Antanas Merkys, who assumed the position of acting president in accordance with the constitution, soon announced he had taken over the Presidency on a permanent basis and appointed Justas Paleckis, favored by the Soviet authorities, as the Prime Minister ahead of the ""people's government"". Merkys soon resigned, allowing Paleckis to assume the post of acting president as well.[3] The presidency of Merkys is not recognized as legitimate in modern Lithuania[4] and Paleckis is not listed as an interwar Prime Minister in government sources.[2]

Chodkiewicz,"The House of Chodkiewicz (Belarusian: Хадкевіч; Lithuanian: Chodkevičius) was one of the most influential noble families of Lithuanian-Ruthenian descent within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16th and 17th century.[1]

Chodko Jurewicz, chamberlain to Grand Duke Vytenis, was probably the ancestor of the whole clan and gave it the name Chodkiewicz, meaning ""son of Chodzko"". Surnames were not used in that time, but apparently later in history, the name Chodzko became a surname after Christianization of Chodzko Juriewicz, father of Iwan (later Jan) Chodkiewicz. They bore the Chodkiewicz coat of arms. In 1572, Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz converted from Calvinism to Roman Catholicism with his two sons, which made them the first Polonized generation of the once Lithuanian-Ruthenian family.

Lithuanian Police Force,"Law enforcement in Lithuania is the responsibility of a national police under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry. The main institution is the Lithuanian Police Department (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Policijos Departamentas) led by the Police Commissar General.

The origins of the Lithuanian police could be traced back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, when the first Boni Ordinis Commission (literally, Good Order Commission) was established in Gardinas in 1776 (later in Brest, Minsk, Kaunas and other cities).[4][5] These institutions were directly subordinate to the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[4] However, the regional magnates were resisting the reforms as they saw the new institutions as a restriction of their authority.[4]
In 1775, the Permanent Council of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth established a Police department, but it did not have the authority over the Boni Ordinis Commissions and served primarily as an advisory body.[4] In 1791, the Great Sejm established the Police Commission of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[6] A separate Police Commission of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the headquarters in Vilnius was established in 1793.[6] It is considered to be the predecessor of the contemporary Ministry of the Interior.[4]

The origins of the contemporary police are the volunteer militia formed in 1918 after the declaration of the Republic of Lithuania.[3] The uniforms were approved in 1919 and the first laws regulating the police were adopted on 14 May 1920. The organisation was formally renamed to police on 1 January 1924.[3] The police was divided into public police and criminal police.[7] There were several reforms and reorganizations in the following years and the Police Department was established on 1 January 1935, which composed of public, border, railway, private and water police divisions.[3] In 1927, police employed 1262 officers, while in 1940 police had 2735 officers.[7]

The current form of police was established on 11 December 1990, following the adoption of the Law on Police.[3] In 1991, Lithuania joined Interpol.[8] Since joining the European Union, Lithuania is also a member of Europol.[8]

Lithuanian Police Department is established under the Ministry of the Interior.[9] It is led by the Police Commissioner General. The department consists of ten County Police Headquarters (Lithuanian: apskrities vyriausiasis policijos komisariatas, literally county chief police commissariat).[9] They are further divided into sub-units of local police.[10]

Additionally, the Police Department consists of the following specialized institutions:[9][10]

History of archives of Lithuania,"Archives in Lithuania began to take shape with the formation of the State of Lithuania, i.e. in the first half of the 13th century, but no documents relating to this period remain. The oldest extant archives is the collection of legal documents of the Office (Chancellery) of the Grand Duke of Lithuania (further on referred to as GDL), also known as Lithuanian Metrica: it has documents from the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1795, this collection was transferred from Vilnius to Russia as a war trophy, and now it is preserved in Moscow. The archives which existed in Vilnius and other towns of Lithuania (Archives of the Supreme Tribunal of GDL, archives of land courts and castle courts of Vilnius Region (Pavietas) of GDL, etc.) up to the middle of the 19th century were basically institutional archives.

The emergence of the Central Archives of the Old Record Books in Vilnius marks a totally new period in the history of Lithuanian archives. Vilnius Central Archives of the Old Record Books (later on referred to as the Archives) were established on 2 April 1852 (O.S.) on the grounds of the imperial decree of Nicholas I, Emperor of Russia. The Tsar Administration was willing to store documents in one place, to safeguard them against forgery or destruction in order to meet the needs of state institutions as well as private persons, especially the nobility. In 1853, by choice of the authorities, the closed Vilnius University building was fitted to accommodate the Archives. The direct supervision of the Archives was assigned to the Educational Board of Vilnius District. However, the activities of the Archives were also under control of Vilnius military governor (Governor-General), i.e. the actual governor of the state.

According to the above-mentioned decree of 1852, old record books dating back to ancient times and up to 1799 were to be transferred from various offices in Vilnius, Minsk, Grodno, and Kaunas governorates (guberniyas) to the Vilnius Central Archives of the Old Record Books. Essentially, the Archives were completed as late as 1862 – at that time, the old record books kept there totalled 17,388.  They were mainly documents produced by various institutions of GDL. In fact, the accumulation of documents continued: in 1887, documents of the liquidated Lublin Old Record Books Archives were transferred to the Vilnius Archives; documents of the cancelled Vitebsk Central Archives of the Old Record Books were also transferred to the Vilnius Archives in 1903.

The activities of the Archives did not restrict to the document accumulation. The old record books were managed (described, numbered, assigned to fonds) and bound up. There were also inventories of the old record books, as well as place-name indexes arranged. The stock of the accumulated documents served as a base to provide offices and private persons with archival certificates or legal document extracts. Some historical sources have been published. As a matter of fact, the selection of such documents for publication was rather slanted as they mainly served the purpose of leaving no doubt about the “North-western Krai” as an inherent part of Russia. Scientists and other outsiders were rarely admitted to the research of the historical sources – it was possible only with the permission of the highest or local authorities.

After the World War I broke out, nearly half of the documents – the oldest and the most valuable ones kept in the Archives – were exported to Russia. During the times of the occupation of Lithuania by German Empire in 1915–18, the Archives evaded any serious harm. After the German army retreated, in 1919–20, the administration and supervision of the Archives was under Lithuanian governance which was replaced by Polish governance and, later on, by Bolshevik rule. During a very difficult period of military actions in 1919–20, the Vilnius State Archives subordinate to the Polish authorities emerged. It took over the documents not only from the former Vilnius Central Archives of the Old Record Books, but also M. Muravjov museum, former General Archives of Vilnius Offices, and other archives.

For quite a long time the fonds of the Archives were kept in separate buildings in Vilnius, until the Archives moved into a new building situated in 8 Slovackio Street (now 8 Mindaugo Street). However, regular activities of the Archives were terminated by the World War II. After the Soviet army occupied Vilnius, during the period of 14–22 October 1939, approximately 14–18 railway vans loaded with archival documents left for Minsk. The damage that the Archives suffered was immense as it lost its most valuable and most significant sets of documents including approximately 20 thousand old record books and packages. After Lithuania regained Vilnius, the Archives were transferred under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. Juozapas Stakauskas was appointed Head of the Archives.

After the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in June 1940, the Archives were transferred under the jurisdiction the Commissariat of the Interior on 26 August 1940. At the beginning of 1941, after the numerous reorganisations, the Archives started functioning as the Central State Archives of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.

When the World War II broke out and Lithuania was invaded by the German army in the summer of 1941, the remaining archival documents were in great danger again. Nevertheless, thanks to the incredible luck, J. Stakauskas, Head of the Archives, managed not only to secure the Archives but also to recover the bulk of the documents that were taken to Minsk in 1939: over 20 railway vans of files were brought back to Vilnius in 1942–43.

During Nazi occupation in 1941–44, the Lithuanian Archives were made subordinate to the Reichcommissariat Ostland Adviser for Archival Affairs, so it was mainly Germans who could make use of the archives. Besides, special permits were required to get access to the archives. It is even more amazing that J. Stakauskas, Head of the Archives, and several of his colleagues were sheltering 12 Jewish people in the premises of the Archives for nearly a year at the risk of their lives – and saved life to these people.

In 1944, when the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania again, both the former name and the former subordination were returned to the Archives in Vilnius. The newly appointed authorities were mainly focused on the selection of the loyal employees, handling inquiries of “operational bodies” about private persons, restricting access to historical sources for the public, and absolutely irresponsibly destroyed a certain amount of documents “of little value”; besides, they exported some archival fonds to Belarus without any justification whatsoever.

The idea of establishing separate, independent historical archives was first generated in 1949. The documents compiled in the years before 15 December 1918 were to form the base for the Archives. In 1951, the Division of the Historical Documents Fonds was established in the Archives. The Central State Historical Archives of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic as a separate institution were established on 1 January 1957. After the former subordination of the Archives was abolished in 1960, they became more open to the society, Lithuanian and foreign scientists.

During this period, a fair amount of the microfilms of historical sources dating back to the 13th to 19th centuries and of great significance to Lithuania (including the Lithuanian Metrica) were added to the fonds of the Archives. They were previously kept in Latvia, Poland, Russia, Belarus, and the Ukraine. A growing number of documents were being published and presented to the public. After the former secret fonds were declassified and starting with 1989, all documents were made accessible to researchers.

The documents kept in the Lithuanian Archives comprise 8 large sets:

As of 2013[update] the total amount of the items preserved is 1,360 million, or over 17,500 linear metres and shelving space.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_archives_of_Lithuania
Lithuanian nobility,"The Lithuanian nobility (Lithuanian: bajorija) or szlachta of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Didžiosios Kunigaikštystės šlėkta, Polish: szlachta Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego) was historically a legally privileged hereditary elite class in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth (including during period of foreign rule 1795–1918) consisting of Lithuanians from Lithuania Proper; Samogitians from Duchy of Samogitia; following Lithuania's eastward expansion into what is now Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, many ethnically Ruthenian noble families (boyars); and, later on, predominantly Baltic German families from the Duchy of Livonia and Inflanty Voivodeship.[1]

Initially, the privileged social group of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was called boyars. Boyars became part of the szlachta (nobility) during the Union of Horodło on October 2, 1413, initiating nobility in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania following the Western European model (with a hereditary system of heraldic identification), as well as an increase in the position of the Greater Lithuanian nobility. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes, and 47 selected boyars of Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Catholic faith were adopted by Polish noble families and received Polish coats of arms.[2]

With the Union of Lublin, nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the nobility of the Kingdom of Poland became a common entity of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which had one of the largest percentages of nobility in Europe, with szlachta constituting close to 10% of the population, but in some constituent regions, like Duchy of Samogitia, it was closer to 12%. However, the high nobility was extremely limited in number, consisting of the magnates and later, within the Russian Empire, of princes.

Families of the nobility were responsible for military mobilization and enjoyed Golden Liberty; some were rewarded with additional privileges for success on the battlefield. In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, ducal titles were mostly inherited by descendants of old dynasties while the relatively few hereditary noble titles in the Kingdom of Poland were bestowed by foreign monarchs. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had one of the largest percentages of nobility in Europe, with szlachta (nobility) constituting close to 10% of the population, but in some constituent regions, like Duchy of Samogitia, it was closer to 12%. However, the high nobility was extremely limited in number, consisting of the magnates and later, within the Russian Empire, of princes.

Over time, the vast majority of the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania voluntarily became Polonized and recognized Polish national thought as a natural continuation of Greater Lithuanian national thought.[3]

According to the Polish historian Grzegorz Błaszczyk, Lithuanian nobility doesn’t mean the same as the leaders of today's Lithuania, as the terms ""Lithuanians"" and ""Lithuanian"" have changed over the centuries.[3] According to the Lithuanian historian Vytautas Spečiūnas, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was formed on the basis of Lithuania proper, which is a part of the Eastern Balts ethnic territory.[4] According to the Polish historian Jerzy Ochmański [pl], already during the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuania proper was a term designated to land where Lithuanians live.[5] The Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas in his 11 March 1420 letter sent to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, wrote about Samogitia that ""it is and has always been the same Lithuanian land, because there is one language and the same inhabitants. The people of Samogitia have long called themselves as Lithuanians and never as Samogitians, and because of such identity (sic) we do not write about Samogitia in our letter, because everything is one: one country and the same inhabitants"" (see also: Samogitian dialect, Lithuanian language).[6]

As cultural homogenization and linguistic Polonization of the nobility progressed, the concept of Lithuanian began to mean simply regional difference within the uniform political nation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.[3] The main Polonizing factors, as in other areas of the First Republic of Poland, were the church, the manor and the city, where the lower social classes adopted and thereby took over the cultural patterns of the higher classes.[7]

Already in 1576, seven years after the conclusion of the Union of Lublin, Augustyn Rotundus, a historiographer of Greater Lithuania at that time, wrote that the Lithuanian language previously used by some citizens of Grand Duchy of Lithuania was used by peasants, while the nobility widely adopted Polish.[8] However, it should be mentioned that this process took place without orders or prohibitions, without coercion, mainly under the influence of civilizational domination and administrative influence (there is also no evidence of administrative coercion).[7]

Polonization processes led to the fact that already in the 17th century, Lithuanian landowners called themselves gente Lithuani, natione Poloni (Latin: Lithuanians by birth, Poles by nationality).[9] In 1697, in the entire Grand Duchy of Lithuania, at the request of the local Lithuanian nobility, Polish was introduced as the official language instead of the previously existing Ruthenian language.[7]

In the 18th century, the Polonization of the lands within the borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a completed process, and the Polonization of Vilnius was a state of affairs.[7] Despite the lack of their own state, the conviction of the permanent nature of Lithuania's relationship with Poles and the territorial integrity of their common, although enslaved, homeland was strengthening in the minds of all Poles. In the lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the cultural unity of inhabitants was strengthening, and many traditionally understood Lithuanians discovered a modern national identity - they became Poles. It should be noted, however, that the described processes took place almost exclusively within the nobility and landed gentry and among the intelligentsia.[10]

The fall of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and unsuccessful armed uprisings led to the strengthening of the Polonization processes of the small nobility of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, identifying spiritually and culturally with Polish traditions. Post-uprising repression resulted in the Catholic Church becoming the mainstay of Polishness. Because the Catholic Church had a Polish character, it became an element integrating both the conscious classes and the popular masses, who began to identify with Polishness through their religion.[8]

The January Uprising of 1863-1864 and the wave of post-uprising repressions were a great shock for the people of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, under the influence of painful experiences, the sense of community between Lithuanianness and Polishness became even stronger, and the belief in the identity of both elements became almost a patriotic axiom. Additionally, in the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, the process of linguistic Polonization of the rural population accelerated rapidly, especially in the Vilnius region.[10]

In the consciousness of the general Polish society at that time, the multi-ethnic heritage of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was increasingly identified simply with Polish heritage. Such views were held by the most active and opinion-forming layer of the emerging nation. The intelligentsia grew up in an atmosphere of supremacy of nobility culture, so they easily identified with it. It adopted the nobility's way of perceiving the world, even if it came from other social groups. According to a commonly accepted interpretation, the history of the ""peoples"" inhabiting the eastern lands of the former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth constituted an integral part of the history of Poles. The local ""peoples"" (especially Lithuanians and Belarusians) were perceived at best as ""younger brothers"", naturally subordinated to the Polish national interest. It was therefore necessary to educate them and guide them in the right direction, because they were not yet mature enough to make independent decisions. ""Our Polish paternalism - writes Roman Wapiński - is firmly located in the East.[10]

In the Second Polish Republic, Lithuanians lived mainly in the counties on the border with Lithuania: Święciany, Vilnius-Trakai and Suwałki, and almost all of them were rural people engaged in agriculture.[11] At the beginning of the 20th century, descendants of former noble Lithuanians were most likely to call themselves Poles. Only a part of the nobility, openly referring to the traditions of historical Lithuania, trying to reconcile Lithuanianness with Polishness, called themselves ""old Lithuanians"", ""historical Lithuanians"" or ""The Mickiewicz's"" (i.e. - such as in Adam Mickiewicz, from the first words of the invocation from the poem Pan Tadeusz: ""O Lithuania, my country ... "" ). In turn, the representatives of the former ""Semigalian people"", now ""nationalized"", called themselves Lithuanians, additionally reserving the exclusive right to this term.[11] However, attempts were made to create organizations of native Lithuanians of noble descent. On April 4, 1928, the Lithuanian Boyars Society (Lithuanian: Lietuvos bajorų draugija) was established, which operated until 1940.[12]

Upon adoption of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania in 1990 and this way ending the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the Royal Union of the Lithuanian Boyars (Lithuanian: Lietuvos bajorų karališkoji sąjunga) was established in Vilnius in 1994 which continues the interwar period Society traditions, perform legitimation processes of historical Lithuanian nobles, organize ceremonies of awarding acts of recognition of nobility and unites thousands of Lithuanian nobles.[13][14] However, the criteria for belonging to the nobility of this organization are treated liberally, accepting members who can prove their descent only through the female line. Therefore, the Royal Union of the Lithuanian Boyars has no chance of acceptance by international associations.[15]

According to Professor Grzegorz Błaszczyk, the heritage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania belongs primarily to the descendants of old Greater Lithuanian families, most of whom were Polonized and still live in Poland today.[3] The last representative of the great Lithuanian families living in today's Lithuania, Stefania Maria Romer, died in 2012.[16] Meanwhile, in Poland, about 2,000 Polish families with Lithuanian origins live and use the Polish language,[3] including the Radziwiłł,[17] Czartoryski,[18] Tyszkiewicz,[19] Sanguszko,[20] Sapieha,[21] Giedroyć,[22] Piłsudski,[18] Puzyna,[23] Woroniecki[24][25] and Romer families.[26][17]

The president of the Genealogical and Heraldic Society of Lithuania, Czesław Malewski, commented that currently there are no famous families left in Lithuania, and the functioning and competing associations of the Lithuanian nobility gather in their ranks representatives of the minor nobility, most often descending from their families on the distaff side.[16]

Prior to the baptism by Mindaugas, lesser members of the nobility were called bajorai (singular - bajoras) and greater nobles, kunigai (singular - kunigas), related to the Old German: kunig, meaning ""king"", or Lithuanian: kunigaikštis, usually translated as duke, Latin: dux. These positions evolved from tribal leaders and were chiefly responsible for waging wars and organizing raids operations into enemy territories.  Following the establishment of a unified state, they gradually became subordinates to greater Dukes, and later to the King of Lithuania. After Mindaugas' death, all Lithuanian rulers held the title Grand Duke (Lithuanian: Didysis kunigaikštis), or king, which was the title sometimes used by Gediminas and several others.

Ethnic Lithuanian nobility had different names than common people, as their names consisted of two stems. Greater noble families generally used their predecessor's Lithuanian pagan given names as their family names; this was the case with Goštautai, Radvilos, Astikai, Kęsgailos and others. Those families acquired great wealth, eventually becoming magnates.  Their representatives are respectively Jonas Goštautas, Radvila Astikas, Kristinas Astikas and Mykolas Kęsgaila. The aforementioned families were granted corresponding Polish coats of arms under the Union of Horodlo in 1413.

While at the beginning the nobility was almost all Lithuanian or Samogitian, with territorial expansion more Ruthenian families joined the nobility. As early as the 16th century, several Ruthenian noble families began to call themselves gente Ruthenus, natione Lithuanus.[27] A good example is the Chodkiewicz family, which attributed its ancestry to the House of Gediminas.

The term boyar, boiarstvo (bajorai) originally denoted all those who fought. Over the course of the 15th century, it changed its meaning to refer to the masses of ordinary nobility who could stand up to fight when called upon. There were also social groups that were personally free but had no military commitments. Such a group were, for example, putnie boyars, who served as grand-ducal envoys and were in charge of road maintenance.[28] A significant group of boyars were service boyars who did not own allodial land, but only service estates, which they received and owned only by the grace of the Grand Duke. As the role and wealth of the great magnates increased, the service boyars put themselves at the service of the lords and princes in exchange for tenures.[29]

The process of the formation of the noble estate in Lithuania accelerated after the union with Poland when there arose a desire to equalize the legal system of both countries. Nobility, or szlachta, in Poland was already a well-established estate, its legal position was consolidated in the 14th century.[30] At this point, it was basically impossible to enter the noble status otherwise than by birth. The development of the idea of corona regni aroused among the nobility a notion of being the main unifying force of the kingdom and responsible for its rule.[31] Lithuanian nobles aspired to this position. Privileges of 1387 and 1413 gave legal security of tenure to holders of allodial land and recognized in law the rights of landowners to pass on their estates.[32] Although allodial land ownership was previously known in the Grand Duchy, its prevalence increased significantly in the following period. Similarly, the new law of inheritance led to a decline in the importance, outside Kaunas district and Samogitia, of clan kinships, in favour of more nuclear families.[33]

This led to a rapid change in the structure of land ownership. While in 1386 80% of the population lived in the lands directly under the Grand Duke's rule, by 1528 this figure had fallen to 30%. It is estimated that 5% of the land was owned by the Church, while as much as 65% of the land was then in the hands of 13 thousand of noble families (6 thousand of them were of Lithuanian origin). Most of it was owned by a small group of several dozen families of lords, which constituted the political elite of the country.[34]

New terms emerged for all those of noble birth: shliakhta (from Polish: szlachta; Lithuanian: šlėkta) in Ruthenian and nobiles in Latin. The term zemianin [pl] (Lithuanian: ziemionys) began to denote the nobles who possessed land.[35] Szlachta itself was stratified into several categories.

As the privileges and political importance of the nobility grew and the burdens and freedoms of the peasantry were reduced, these linguistic differences began to gain importance. Around the beginning of the 16th century, groups of boyars spared no effort to prove their noble status. The grand ducal council resolved that nobility had to be attested by the testimony of two neighbours, of undoubtedly noble lineage, saying that the applicant's family had been ""boyars and shliakhta through the ages"".[36] Another opportunity to prove nobility were the military musterings, the first one organised in 1528, where a register of those capable to fight was prepared. A listing in such a register was legal proof of nobility.[36]

Initially, a group distinguished by prestige were the princely families, which members bore the title of knyaz. These were mostly, at least according to tradition, the descendants of the dynasties who accepted the authority of Gediminids. However, only those who owned land in Lithuania proper, who were of Lithuanian origin and who had accepted Catholicism in 1386, had any influence on central state policy. The Ruthenian princes had influence only on the local situation in their lands.[37] They varied considerably in terms of wealth and importance, some of them wielding huge estates, while others possessed their land on service tenure from the grand duke or another prince (so-called 'service princes' - князя слчжбовiе).[38] The most powerful princes retained almost total power in their lands, recognising the supremacy of the grand dukes. Vytautas began a policy of limiting the power of the princes and incorporating their appanages into the domain. Many princes died in civil wars after his death. Many appanages, lying in the east, were lost to Moscow in the course of wars in the 15th and 16th centuries. Some families became extinct, and with the restriction of the circle of inheritance, their estates were incorporated into the grand-ducal domain.[39] In 1499 Alexander regulated the legal system of the few remaining appanages, the magnates ruling them were given the full ius ducale. This was of little political significance since the princes as a political class were of little importance.[40]

Regarding Lithuania proper, not counting descendants of Gediminas seven princely families are known: Borowski, Dowgowd, Giedraitis/Giedrojć, Jamontowicz, Holshansky, Sudemund, Świrski.[41] They also used the title knyaz, which is probably a rendering of the Lithuanian kunigas, which in pagan times probably belonged to every person of noble status. It is not clear whether they owed their princely dignity to their former status as sovereigns or to their connection and affinity with the ruling family established in the 14th century (this is confirmed at least for the Gedraitis and Holshanskys).[42]

Among them, only the Holshansky played a significant role on the side of the grand dukes, starting from Jogaila and Vytautas, being in the strict power elite. Apart from them, these were the families descended from Gediminas family: Olelkovich, Belsky, Kobryński and Zasławski.[43] The princes of ethnically Ruthenian origin were excluded from the strict power elite and found their place in it only at the end of the 15th century. Then the representatives of powerful Volhynian families: Sanguszko, Czartoryski, Ostrogski and Zasławski found their place in the power elite.[44]

Since the reign of Vytautas, documents began to distinguish a group of great lords, calling them in Latin baro (pl. barones), dominus (pl. domini) or, in Ruthenian texts, ""great boyars"" (боярe великie). Soon, the borrowed from Polish term ""pan"" (plural ""pany"", пан;[33] ponai or didikai), literally meaning ""lord"" gained popularity.[33] This new elite was only partly descended from the old princely families that ruled Lithuania in pagan times. To a large extent, these were new families that appeared during the reigns of Jogaila and Vytautas and whose representatives were among the signatories of the Union of Horodło (1413).[45] They owed their position to the generosity of the grand dukes, who rewarded them with offices and land granted in allodium.[46]

In the Union of Horodło (1413) forty-five Polish families adopted forty-seven Lithuanian Catholic families, lending them their coats of arms. It is assumed that the representatives of Lithuanian nobility gathered in Horodło constituted the elite of that time on which Vytautas based his authority.[47] The adoption of Polish coats of arms, an important marker of nobility with a well-established tradition in Western Europe, elevated this narrow group above other privileged population groups.[48] Despite the fact that some of them abandoned the Horodło coats of arms and replaced them with others, the political significance of this gesture did not lose its significance. In the system built by Vytautas, central offices were restricted to Catholics only, which excluded nobles of Ruthenian origin. The basis of the Grand Duke's power was the lands of Lithuania proper, basically the provinces of Trakai and Vilnius. Nobles from this region constituted the ruling elite.[49] The situation began to change in the 1430s when nobility privileges began to be extended to the Ruthenian nobility.

The cementing of the new elite was strengthened by the emergence of the institution of the council. Initially, it had no institutionalized form but gathered the ruler's closest associates. However, from 1430 onwards, it began to take shape as a permanent institution, to which one automatically became a member by virtue of holding the relevant office.[50] Possession of the princely title gave the right to participate in wider councils, called Sejm (сеймь, сoймь) a term borrowed from Polish.[50] Their position grew especially during the period when the Grand Duke was also King of Poland and was away from the country for long periods. Crucial to this was the privilege of 1492, which gave the council enormous influence over the politics of the Grand Duchy. Practically giving it full control over the actions of the ruler. While in Poland at that time the limitation of royal power was associated with an increase in the role of the ordinary nobility, in the Grand Duchy, where nobility assemblies (sejmiks) did not exist, full power passed into the hands of the great lords.[51] Grand Duchy of Lithuania offices were held almost exclusively by magnates.

Potent Radziwiłł family (Radvila) received the title of the prince (German: Reichsfürst; Polish: książę) from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1518, similarly some other families received titles of counts (Goštautai/Gasztołd in 1529/30; Ilinicz in 1553; Chodkiewicz in 1568; possibly Kęsgailos/Kieżgajło in 1547) from the Emperor.[52] The elevation of the Radziwiłł family resulted in the abandonment of the title of ""knyaz"" by those Ruthenian families that still retained significant power, wealth and often appanages (for example Wiśniowiecki, Ostrogski, Zbaraski). They adopted instead the Polish title ""książę"", which in Ruthenian texts was translated as ""knyazhe"".[53] As a result, the poorer prince families that still used the title of knyaz fell completely into insignificance, and the Lithuanian magnate elite consisted of ""princes and lords"" (Polish: ""książąt i panów"").[53][54]

Following his distribution of state land, the Grand Duke became dependent on powerful landowners, who began demanding greater liberties and privileges. The nobles were granted administrative and judicial power in their domains and increasing rights in state politics. The legal status of the nobility was based on several privileges, granted by the Grand Dukes:

Most of the nobility rights were retained even after the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795.

The nobility was particularly numerous in the ethnically Lithuanian lands and is estimated to have constituted about 10-11%, while in the Ruthenian lands of the Grand Duchy only about 3-4%. The nobility in Samogitia was particularly numerous, but usually, it was a poor nobility living in gentry villages. In the right-bank part of Kaunas county the nobility accounted for as much as 25% of the hearths in the late 18th century.[55] In 1777 there were 16,534 noble houses registered (5.2% of the total) in the whole Grand Duchy. In 1790 the register showed 100 palaces, 9,331 manors, 494 noblemen's houses in towns, and 13,890 houses of noblemen without subjects.[55]

Linguistic Polonization did not always mean full Polonization in the state or ethnic sense. The Lithuanian nobility felt united with the Polish nobility as part of one political nation of the Commonwealth, enjoying privileges, freedom and equality.[56] In this sense, they often referred to themselves as ""Polish nobility"" or outright ""Poles"". At the same time, separatism and the defense of Lithuanian national separateness within the federation state were very strong. The Lithuanian nobility was warmly attached to the laws, traditions and symbols of the Grand Duchy.[56] Moreover, the Lithuanian separateness was also defended by the members of ethnically Polish families settling in Lithuania.[56]

Following the Union of Horodło (1413), the Lithuanian nobility's rights were equalized with those of the ruling class of the Kingdom of Poland (szlachta). During the following centuries, the Lithuanian nobility began to merge with the Polish nobility.[citation needed] The process accelerated after the Union of Lublin (1569), resulting in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Lithuanian nobility polonised, replacing Lithuanian and Ruthenian languages with Polish although the process took centuries. In the 16th century, a newly established theory amongst Lithuanian nobility was popular, claiming that Lithuanian nobility was of Roman extraction, and the Lithuanian language was just a morphed Latin language.[57][58] By that time, the upper nobility and the ducal court already used Polish as their first language.[59] The last Grand Duke known to have spoken Lithuanian was Casimir IV Jagiellon (1440-1492).[60] In 1595 Mikalojus Daukša addressed Lithuanian nobility calling for the Lithuanian language to play a more important role in state life.[60][59] The usage of Lithuanian declined, and the Polish language became the predominant administrative language in the 16th century,[61] eventually replacing Ruthenian as the official language of the Grand Duchy in 1697.[62] Nonetheless, spoken Lithuanian was still common in the Grand Duchy courts during the 17th century.[60]

At first, only Lithuanian magnate families were affected by Polonization,[60] although many of them like the Radziwiłłs remained loyal to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and safeguarded its sovereignty vis-à-vis the Kingdom of Poland. Gradually Polonization spread to a broader population, and for the most part, the Lithuanian nobility became part of both nations’ szlachta.

The middle nobility adopted the Polish language in the 17th century, while the minor rural nobles remained bilingual up to the period when the question of language related-nationality appeared.[61]

The Lithuanian nobles did preserve their national awareness as members of the Grand Duchy,[59] and in most cases recognition of their Lithuanian family roots; their leaders would continue to represent the interests of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the General sejm and in the royal court.

Lithuanian language was used during Kościuszko Uprising in the proclamations calling to rise up For our freedom and yours. And Lithuanian nobles did rise to fight for the independence of their nation.

In Lithuania proper, the Polonization of the nobility, gentry and townspeople was practically complete by the early 19th century, relegating the Lithuanian language to the status of a peasant's tongue.[60][63] The processes of Polonization and russification were partially reversed with the Lithuanian National Revival. Despite origins from mostly the non-noble classes, a number of nobles re-embraced their Lithuanian roots.

The lesser Lithuanian nobility, still partially preserving the Lithuanian language,[64] subsequent to the partitions of the Commonwealth left most of the former Grand Duchy under control of the Russian Empire. The situation worsened during the years of tsar Nicholas I of Russia's rule. After the November uprising imperial officials wanted to minimize the social base for another potential uprising and thus decided to reduce the noble class. During the period 1833–1860, 25,692 people in Vilna Governorate and 17,032 people in Kovno Governorate lost their noble status. They could not prove their status with monarchs' privileges[clarification needed] or land ownership.[65] They did not lose personal freedom, but were assigned as one steaders[clarification needed] Russian: однодворцы in rural areas and as citizens in towns.

In view of the January Uprising, imperial officials announced that ""Lithuanians are Russians seduced by Poles and Catholicism"" and banned press in the Lithuanian language and started the Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings.

Over the course of time, the Lithuanian nobility increasingly developed a sense of belonging to the Polish nation.[66] During the 19th century, a self-designation, often represented using a Latin formula gente Lithuanus, natione Polonus (Lithuanian by birth, Polish by nationality) was common in Lithuania Proper and the former Samogitian Eldership.[67] With Polish culture developing into one of the primary centers of resistance to the Russian Empire, Polonization in some regions actually strengthened in response to official policies of Russification. An even larger percentage of Lithuanian nobility was Polonised and adopted Polish identity by the late 19th century. A Russian census in 1897 showed that 27.7% of nobility living within modern Lithuania's borders recognized Lithuanian as the mother language.[68][69] This number was even higher in Kovno Governorate, where 36.6% of nobility identified the Lithuanian language as their mother language.[68]

Most descendants of the Lithuanian nobility remained ill-disposed to the modern national movements of Lithuania and Belarus and fought for Poland in 1918-1920.[66] The landowning nobles in the new Lithuanian state saw themselves predominately as Poles of Lithuanian background.[70] During the interbellum years the government of Lithuania issued land reform limiting manors with 150 hectares of land while confiscating land from those nobles who were fighting alongside the Polish in Polish-Lithuanian War.  Many members of the Lithuanian nobility during the interbellum and after World War II emigrated to Poland, many were deported to Siberia during the years 1945–53 of Soviet occupation, many manors were destroyed. The Association of Lithuanian Nobility was established in 1994.[71]

Lithuanian and Samogitian families possessed heraldry predating formal Christianization. The most archaic type of post-1413 heraldry has a motive of crossed arrows. According to the Union of Horodło of 1413, 47 Lithuanian and Samogitian noble houses adopted Polish nobility coat of arms. As the nobility expanded during the following centuries more coats of arms were created.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_nobility
Kingdom of Lithuania,"The Kingdom of Lithuania was a sovereign state that existed from the 17 July 1251 until the death of the first crowned king of Lithuania, Mindaugas, on 12 September 1263.[1] Mindaugas was the only Lithuanian monarch crowned king with the assent of the Pope and the head of the first Catholic Lithuanian state. The formation of the kingdom is widely regarded as a partially successful attempt at unifying all surrounding Baltic tribes, including the Old Prussians, into a single unified state under a common king.[2]

Other monarchs of Lithuania were referred to as grand dukes, kings or emperors in extant foreign written sources as the size of the realm and their power expanded or contracted. This practice can be compared to that of British, Japanese and many other monarchs who are known as kings or emperors in spite of not being crowned with the assent of the Pope. Because Lithuania was pagan in the 13th century, Lithuanian monarchs were not granted the title of a Catholic monarch even though extant Christian sources referred to Lithuanian rulers as kings or emperors regardless of their religious affiliation. [3] For instance, Gediminas titled himself King of Lithuania and Rus, and Duke of Semigalia. The Pope also addressed him as King.

The confusion stems from eastern and western European traditions of royal hierarchy and titles. In Eastern Europe, the title of grand duke equalled king and sometimes emperor. In Western Europe, the title of grand duke is reserved to monarchs of small polities and ranks junior to king and emperor.

After the formal Christianization[4] and especially after the creation of the personal union with Poland, the Kings of Poland–Lithuania retained the separate titles of Grand Dukes of Lithuania and Kings of Poland (similarly to how the Emperors of Austria–Hungary had retained the separate titles of Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, to some extent).

The Catholic crown was to be received from the Pope or Holy Roman Emperor. Lithuania was subservient to both and with rare exceptions did not pursue the title. For diplomatic reasons three further attempts were made to re-establish the Kingdom status – by Vytautas the Great in 1430, by Švitrigaila who wanted to continue Vytautas' attempts at the coronation, and by the Council of Lithuania in 1918.

In the early 13th century, Lithuania was inhabited by various pagan Baltic tribes, which began to organize themselves into a state – the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the 1230s, Mindaugas emerged as the leader of the Grand Duchy. In 1249, an internal war erupted between Mindaugas and his nephews Tautvilas and Edivydas. As each side searched for foreign allies, Mindaugas succeeded in convincing the Livonian Order not only to provide military assistance but also to secure for him the royal crown of Lithuania in exchange for his conversion to Catholicism and some lands in western Lithuania. The status of a kingdom was granted on 17 July 1251, when the Bishop of Chełmno was ordered to crown Mindaugas by Pope Innocent IV.[1] Two years later, Mindaugas and his wife Morta were crowned King and Queen of Lithuania.[1] In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from Pope Alexander IV to crown his son King of Lithuania.

The coronation and the alliance with the Livonian Order allowed for a period of peace between Lithuania and Livonia. During that time, the Lithuanians expanded east, while Livonia attempted to conquer Samogitia. Enticed by his nephew Treniota, Mindaugas broke the peace after the Order was defeated in the Battle of Skuodas in 1259 and the Battle of Durbe in 1260. Lithuanian forces were, however, unable to prevent the devastating Mongol invasion of Lithuania in 1258–1259.[5] Treniota's influence grew as he waged a war against the Order and his priorities began to diverge from those of Mindaugas.[6] The conflict resulted in the assassination of Mindaugas and two of his sons in 1263. The country reverted to paganism and its status as a kingdom was lost. The state survived as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the subsequent monarchs are known as Grand Dukes as they could not be crowned Kings until they converted to Christianity (the Christianization of Lithuania occurred only in 1387).

There was an attempt by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great (ruled 1392–1430) to receive a Catholic crown. At the Congress of Lutsk in 1430, Sigismund, King of Hungary who was yet to be elected Holy Roman Emperor, offered Vytautas the crown and proclaimed Lithuania a (presumably subservient) kingdom. It did not come to fruition, because of the opposition from Polish nobles and later from his first cousin Jogaila.[7] According to some historians, the crown was sent to Lithuania by Sigismund, but it was intercepted by Polish forces,[8] but in reality, Sigismund sent only the documents proposing an alliance between him, Vytautas and the Teutonic Order, and judgement from legal experts that the coronation could be performed by the bishop of Vilnius.[9] Soon afterwards, Vytautas died without having been crowned Catholic king.

Following the Union of Lublin, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Kings of Poland were also crowned as Grand Dukes of Lithuania and therefore they did not use the title of King of Lithuania; the two parts of the Commonwealth were known to as the Grand Duchy and the Polish Crown.

After Lithuania declared independence in February 1918, the monarchy was re-established and the 2nd Duke of Urach was invited to become King Mindaugas II. However, the monarchy was short-lived and Mindaugas II never visited Lithuania.[10] The Kingdom of Lithuania was a client-state of the German Empire, and following Germany's defeat in World War I in the fall of 1918, the idea of a monarchy was abandoned in favor of a democratic republic.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Lithuania

List of Lithuanian gods and mythological figures,"The list of Lithuanian gods is based on scarce written sources and late folklore. Many of them were outright invented. Lithuania converted to Christianity in 1387, but elements of Lithuanian mythology survived into the 19th century. The earliest written sources, authored by foreigners and Christians, only briefly mention the Lithuanian gods. Beginning in the 16th century, the pagan religion received more attention from authors, but often their accounts were confused, contradictory, and heavily influenced by various religious agendas. Collection and recording of folklore began in the 19th century, by which time the pagan mythology had become fragmented and mixed with Christian traditions. The cults of old deities transformed into folklore (individual tales, myths, songs, etc.) without associated rituals. Because of such difficulties obtaining data, there is no accepted list of Lithuanian gods. Different authors present wildly contradictory reconstructions of the Lithuanian pantheon.

This section includes the names of gods, divine or demonic beings, and other personages from Lithuanian myths, legends, folklore, and fairy-tales.

Some names from Lithuanian mythology are also found in Kievan Rus' chronicles of the 13th century. These deities were secretly worshiped by King of Lithuania Mindaugas after his baptism. Rus' chronicles are considered the best source of information about the ancient Lithuanian pantheon worshiped by nobles and the military.

Martynas Mažvydas in his Latin introduction to Catechismusa Prasty Szadei (1547) urged the people to abandon their pagan ways and mentioned the following gods:[5][6]

Maciej Stryjkowski (1547–1593) – Polish–Lithuanian historian and author of Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all Russia. In this work, Stryjkowski provided two lists of gods, one Old Prussian and another Lithuanian. He listed 16 Lithuanian gods:[7]

Jan Łasicki (Lasicius) was a Polish Protestant activist. He wrote a treatise on idolatry About the gods of Samogitians, other Sarmatians, and false Christians (De diis Samagitarum caeterorumque Sarmatarum et falsorum Christianorum, written ca. 1582 and published in 1615). This 18-page treatise contained a lists of 76 Lithuanian gods with brief description of their functions. Łasicki obtained most of his information from Łaszkowski, a Polish lesser noble who worked as a royal land surveyor. The list contained very minor deities, representing everyday household items. Łasicki was also not intimately familiar with Lithuanian culture or language. Therefore, the academic opinion on the list ranges from a valuable resource to a practical joke designed to poke fun of Christian saints through an inverted mirror. Deities mentioned by Jan Łasicki were:[10]

Deities mentioned by Matthäus Prätorius (1635–1704) were:[14]

Polish-Lithuanian historian Theodor Narbutt wrote the ten-volume work History of the Lithuanian Nation (Dzieje starożytne narodu litewskiego) between 1835 and 1841. The first volume contained a description of Lithuanian mythology. However, modern historians have accused Narbutt of falsifying historical facts and reporting speculations. Thus, some gods mentioned only by Narbutt and unknown from other sources are usually treated as inventions of the author.

This section contains those names of Lithuanian and Prussian gods or other mythical beings that are mentioned in old treatises on history or philosophy, sometimes accompanied by brief descriptions, and which are known from a few independent sources or from their counterparts under different names in later collections of myths and tales.

Names of figures that were more marginal in Lithuanian mythology or less known from existing sources are put here. In fact they denote some spirits or local deities that do not play a main role in the mythology of Lithuanians.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lithuanian_gods_and_mythological_figures
Stolnik,"Stolnik (Lithuanian: stalininkas, Polish: stolnik, Ukrainian: стольник, Russian: сто́льник, IPA: [ˈstolʲnʲɪk]) was a court office in Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Russia, responsible for serving the royal table, then an honorary court title and a district office. It approximately corresponds to English term ""pantler"".

In the Crown of Poland under the first Piast dukes and kings, this was a court office.

From the 14th century, it was an honorary court title in the Kingdom of Poland, since the 16th century.

According to the 1768 district office hierarchy, the Stolnik's position in the Crown of Poland was superior to that of Deputy cup-bearer and inferior to that of district judge.

In Lithuania, the Stolnik's position emerged in the late 15th century, comparatively later than Marshal, Treasurer, and Cup-bearer, with the first Grand Stolnik of Lithuania, Albertas Jonaitis Manvydas [lt], being known from 1475.[1] Initially, the Stolnik took care of the Grand Duke's food warehouses, distribution of food, his manor's parks, gardens, ponds, and villages assigned to the estates.[1] However, in the late 16th century, the position became purely ceremonial and the individual was charged with serving the Grand Duke at the table only during feasts.[1] It was the sons of Lithuanian nobility that began their service in the ruler's court who were assigned the role of the Stolnik .[1] Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Stolnik came from various families such as Alšėniškiai, Kęsgaila, Dorohostaiskiai [lt], Hlebavičiai, Chodkiewicz, Radziwiłł, Sapieha and others.[1] Stanisław August Poniatowski was the Stolnik of Lithuania from 1755 to 1764, while the last one from 1764 to 1795 was Józef Klemens Czartoryski.[1]

There were two types of Stolnik in Lithuania:

According to the 1768 district office hierarchy of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Stolnik was superior to podstoli and inferior to wojski.

Stolniks were known as palace servants of the Russian rulers since the 13th century.[2] In the 16th and 17th centuries they were young nobles who brought dishes to the tsar's table, looked after his bedroom, and accompanied him in travels. The highest category comprised the room or closer stolniks.

Stolniks could simultaneously serve in the foreign office or in the army. They were ranked fifth in the hierarchy of Russian bureaucracy, after boyars, okolnichys, duma nobles, and duma dyaks.

Stolniks were also attached to episcopal administrations as were other similar offices also found in the grand princely or tsarist administration. For example, stolniks are found in documents from the archiepiscopal records in Veliky Novgorod.[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolnik

Temporary capital of Lithuania,"The temporary capital of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Laikinoji sostinė) was the official designation of the city of Kaunas in Lithuania during the interwar period. It was in contrast to the declared capital in Vilnius, which was capital of Republic of Central Lithuania (1920-1922) and part of Poland from 1922 until 1939. Currently, the term temporary capital, despite being factually out of date, is still frequently used as a nickname for Kaunas, the second largest city in Lithuania.

On 18 September 2023, the modernist buildings in Kaunas that were built while Kaunas was the temporary capital of Lithuania and experienced rapid urbanization were recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[1] With this designation, Kaunas became the only European city representing large scale urbanization during the interwar period and a variety of modern architecture (Art Deco, neoclassicism, traditionalism, functionalism, etc.).[1][2]

During World War I, Lithuania declared independence on February 16, 1918. The declaration stated that Lithuania would be a democratic republic with Vilnius as its capital. This claim was based on historical grounds, as the city was founded by Lithuanians and later was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the city was multi-ethnic and other groups laid similar claims. Belarusians saw it as the capital[dubious – discuss] of the Belarusian nation and laid claims to the heritage of the former Grand Duchy[clarification needed]; Jews saw it as the capital of Yiddish culture; Poles saw it as a Polish-inhabited city.[citation needed]

As Soviet forces pushed westward to spread the global proletarian revolution, German Ober-Ost administration evacuated and the Lithuanians withdrew to Kaunas. Vilnius was captured by the Red Army on January 5, 1919. During the Polish–Soviet War the city changed hands frequently: on April 19, 1919, the city was seized by the regular Polish Army; on July 14, 1920, it was recaptured by Soviet forces. After the Soviet defeat in the Battle of Warsaw, Vilnius was handed to the Lithuanian authorities according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of July 12, 1920. Poland continued to claim the city and organized Żeligowski's Mutiny to capture it in October 1920. Polish General Żeligowski established the Republic of Central Lithuania, which was incorporated into Poland in 1922. Such situation remained until 1939. In October 1939 the Soviets transferred the city, which they captured during the invasion of Poland, to Lithuania according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Since then Vilnius has been the capital of the Lithuanian SSR and then independent Lithuania.

Lithuania refused to have diplomatic relations with Poland until the ultimatum of 1938. Railroad traffic, telegraph lines and even mail could not cross the Polish–Lithuanian border. Lithuania continued to refer to Vilnius as its capital in all official documents, including the constitution. Since that city was controlled by Poland, all Lithuanian authorities and military command were transferred to  Kaunas, which became the seat of the government.[3] To reconcile reality with constitutional claims, Kaunas was designated as a temporary or provisional capital until Vilnius could be ""liberated from Polish occupation"". In March 1938, Lithuania accepted a Polish ultimatum, demanding diplomatic relations. Despite normalised relations, the new Lithuanian Constitution, in May 1938, still claimed Vilnius as the de jure capital of Lithuania, and Kaunas remained as the temporary capital.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_capital_of_Lithuania
History of Vilnius,"The city of Vilnius, the capital and largest city of Lithuania, has an extensive history starting from the Stone Age. The city has changed hands many times between Imperial and Soviet Russia, Napoleonic France, Imperial and Nazi Germany, Interwar Poland, and Lithuania.

Initially a Baltic settlement, Vilnius became a significant city under the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1323 in letters by Grand Duke Gediminas, who invited Jews and Germans to settle and built a wooden castle on a hill. Vilnius gained city rights in 1387 after the Christianization of Lithuania and grew as craftsmen and merchants from various nationalities settled in the city. Vilnius was the head of the Grand Duchy until 1795, and during the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Under the Commonwealth, Vilnius flourished, especially after the establishment of Vilnius University by King Stephen Báthory in 1579. The city became a major cultural and scientific center, attracting migrants from both the East and West. It was marked by diverse communities, including Jewish, Orthodox, and German populations. The city experienced significant growth and development, though it faced numerous invasions and occupations, including by the Teutonic Knights, Russia, and later, Germany.

During the Russian Empire's rule, Vilnius became the capital of Vilna Governorate and saw various cultural revivals. The 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by national revivals among Jews, Poles, Lithuanians, and Belarusians. After World War I, Vilnius was often the site of conflict, between Poland and Lithuania, leading to its temporary occupation by Poland, before being annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II.

Following the war, Vilnius became the capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, and later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, it became the capital of an independent Lithuania. The city has since evolved rapidly, transforming from a Soviet-dominated enclave into a modern European city. Significant events, such as the NATO summit in July 2023, highlight Vilnius's ongoing importance on the international stage.

The earliest settlements in the area of present-day Vilnius appear to be of Mesolithic origin. Numerous archaeological findings in different parts of the city prove that the area has been inhabited by peoples of various cultures since the early Middle Ages. Initially a Baltic settlement, later it was also inhabited by Slavs, Jews and Germans. Some historians identify the city with Voruta, a forgotten capital of King Mindaugas.

The city was first mentioned in written sources as Vilna in 1323 as the capital city of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the letters of Gediminas.[2] Gediminas built his wooden castle on a hill in the city. The city became more widely known after he wrote a circular letter of invitation to Germans and Jews to the principal Hansa towns in 1325, offering free access into his domains to men of every order and profession. Gediminas founded first Dominican monastery in 1321. In the second half of the century church of St. Nicholas was erected. At this time Vilnius was facing numerous raids of the Teutonic Order, although they never captured the castle, large portions of the town were burned down in years 1365, 1377 and 1383.

Vilnius was granted city rights by Jogaila in 1387, following the Christianization of Lithuania and the construction of the Vilnius Cathedral. The town was initially populated by local Lithuanians, but soon the population began to grow as craftsmen and merchants of other nationalities settled in the city. In the 14th century, the town was marked by wooden architecture. Stone building existed only at the foot of mount Gedimas and in the surroundings of the Vokiečių gatvė (German street), where German craftsmen and merchants were housed around the Church of Saint Nicholas.[3]

According to a tale, tired after a busy hunting day, Gediminas had a prophetic dream about an iron wolf howling on a top of the hill. When he asked a krivis (a pagan priest) Lizdeika for an explanation of the dream, he was told that he must build a castle on the top of that hill, which is strategically surrounded by three rivers (Neris, Vilnia, and Vingria (now underground)) and a grand city around that hill, so that ""the iron-wolf-like sound about this great city would spread around the world"". Some versions of this tale state, that for his advice, Lizdeika was given a name of Radziwiłł.[6][7][8] The derivative of the Lithuanian name Radvila has also been interpreted as derived from Belarusian радзіць or Polish radzi 'advises'. The Lithuanian word for 'wolf' is vilkas.

In the 14th century, Lithuania was frequently invaded by the Teutonic Order.[9] The future King of England Henry IV (then Henry Bolingbroke) spent a full year in 1390 supporting the unsuccessful siege of Vilnius by Teutonic Knights with his 300 knights. During this campaign, he bought captured Lithuanian women and children, and took them back to Königsberg for conversion to Christianity.[10] King Henry's second expedition to Lithuania in 1392 illustrates the financial benefits of these guest crusaders to the Order. His small army consisted of over 100 men, including longbow archers and six minstrels, at a total cost to the Lancastrian purse of £4,360. Despite the efforts of Bolingbroke and his English crusaders, two years of attacks on Vilnius proved fruitless.[11]

During the inaugurations of Lithuanian monarchs, Gediminas' Cap was placed on the monarch's head by the Bishop of Vilnius in Vilnius Cathedral.[12]

Between 1503 and 1522, for the sake of protection from Crimean Tatar attacks, the city was surrounded by defensive walls that had nine gates and three towers. Communities of Lithuanians, Jews, Ruthenians, and Germans were present in different areas of Vilnius. The Orthodox inhabitants concentrated in the eastern part of the city left of the ""Castle Street"", while most Germans and Jews occupied the western side of the city around the ""German Street"". The town reached the peak of its development under the reign of Sigismund II Augustus, Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, who relocated there in 1544. In 1547, Sigismund II Augustus moved his royal court from Kraków to Vilnius, which had a great influence on the intellectual life of the region.[13][14][15] In 1548, Sigismund II finished the Renaissance style reconstruction of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, which was started by his father Sigismund I.[16][17] In the 16th century, Vilnius became a constantly growing and developing city, as Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus and his mother queen Bona Sforza were spending much of their time in the Royal Palace of Lithuania.

""I saw as many jewels as I did not expect to find accumulated in one place; with them the treasures of Venice and the Pope, which I have also seen, cannot be compared.""

The gradual Polonization of Vilnius, which began in the late 14th century,[19] proceeded through the influx of Polish elements[citation needed] and assimilation of non-Polish burghers. The early Polish population was composed mainly of clerics, craftsmen and merchants, who migrated to the Lithuanian capital in particularly noticeable numbers after the Polish court of Sigismund August moved to Vilnius.[19]

After the Union of Lublin (1569) that created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city flourished further in part due to the establishment of Vilnius University by Stephen Báthory, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1579. The university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centres of the region and the most notable scientific centre of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Political, economic and social life was in full swing there. This is among all proven by the Lithuanian Statutes issued in the 16th century, the last of which was still in force until the 19th century.

Rapidly developing, the city was open to migrants from both East and West. In addition to old citizens, larger Jewish, Orthodox and German communities established themselves in the city. Each group made its contribution to the life of the city, and crafts, trade and science prospered. In the 17th century, Polish and Polonized population began to dominate culturally and likely numerically.[19]

In 1610, the city was racked by a large fire.[20] In 1655, during the First Northern War, Vilnius was captured by the forces of Tsardom of Russia and was pillaged, burned and the population was massacred. The death toll of around 20,000 included a large proportion of Vilnius Jews.[21] The city's growth lost its momentum for many years, yet the number of inhabitants recovered. During the Commonwealth's decline, Vilnius became known as ""Jerusalem of the North"" - a major religion-cultural centre of Eastern European Jewry.[22] In 1769, the Rasos Cemetery was founded; today it is one of the oldest surviving cemeteries in the city.

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Vilnius was annexed by the Russian Empire and became the capital of Vilna Governorate, a part of the Northwestern Krai. In order to allow the city to expand, between the 1799 and 1805 period, the city walls were pulled down, only the Gate of Dawn (also known as Aušros vartai, Medininkų vartai or Ostra Brama, Вострая Брама) remained.[23] In 1803 Alexander I re-established the Polish-language University.[24] In 1812, the city was seized by Napoleon on his push towards Moscow. After the campaign's failure, the Grande Armée retreated to the area where 80,000 French soldiers died and were buried in the trenches they had built months earlier. After the November Uprising the Vilnius University was closed and repressions halted the city's further development. Civil unrest in 1861 was suppressed by the Imperial Russian Army.[25] During the January Uprising in 1863 heavy city fights occurred, but were brutally pacified by Mikhail Muravyov, nicknamed The Hanger by the population because of the number of executions he organized.[citation needed] After the uprising, Polish was banned from public use. The Latin alphabet was prohibited in 1859 (Belarusian) and 1865 (Lithuanian); the ban was lifted in 1904.[26]

During the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century Vilnius also became one of the centres of Jewish, Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian national rebirths. According to the 1897 Russian census, by mother tongue, 40% of the population was Jewish, 31% Polish, 20% Russian, 4.2% Belarusian and 2.1% Lithuanian.[27][28] Jewish culture and population was so dominant that some Jewish national revival leaders argued for a new Jewish state to be founded in the Vilnius region, with the city as its capital. These national revivals happened in Vilnius because it was one of the most tolerant, progressive and liberal places in the region, a legacy of tolerance deriving from the years of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. One of the most important Polish, Belarusian poets and writers published their works in Vilnius at that time. It was the place where the first Belarusian weekly Nasha Niva was founded.[citation needed]

Vilnius became an important place of the act of the Lithuanian national revival on 4–5 December 1905, when the Great Seimas of Vilnius was held in the Palace of the present-day National Philharmonics, with over 2000 delegates from all regions of Lithuania as well as emigres. It was decided to make a demand to establish an autonomous ethnic Lithuanian state within the Russian Empire with its parliament (Seimas) in Vilnius.

Cultural life was revived after the 1905 Russian Revolution. Society of Friends of Science in Wilno was created in 1906 to practice science and literature in Polish.[29] The Emilia and Eustachy Wróblewski Library, the centre of Polish culture, was established in 1912, around that time also Polish theatre was revived.[29] Polish cultural life was still repressed despite its revival. In 1907 bishop Eduard von der Ropp was expelled from Vilnius to Vitebsk.[citation needed]

During World War I, Vilnius was occupied by Germany from 1915 until 1918. Still under German occupation, the Council of Lithuania proclaimed the Act of Independence of Lithuania in Vilnius on 16 February 1918. The act proclaimed the restoration of the independent state of Lithuania with Vilnius as its capital. The German civilian administration of the Ober-Ost declined to pass full authority to Lithuania, which was not controlled by the Germans anymore. Instead, the Germans tried to control the area through promoting conflicts between local nationalities as it became clear that the German plan for the creation of Mitteleuropa, a net of satellite buffer states, failed.

Finally, on 1 January 1919, the German garrison withdrew and passed the authority over the city to a local Polish committee, against the pleas of the Lithuanian administration.[citation needed] A Polish administration started to be formed.[30] Former members of the local Polish Self-Defence formations, now formally part of the Polish Army, took over the posts while the Lithuanians withdrew along with the Germans.[31] On 5 January 1919 the city was taken by Bolshevik forces[30][32] advancing from the east. Vilnius was proclaimed the capital of the Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[33] For the next 4 months the city became a communist experiment in governance.[34] During the course of that conflict, on 19 April 1919 the city was again seized by Poland (Vilna offensive), this time by forces of the regular Polish Army.[34] A year later, on 14 July 1920, it was lost to Soviet forces again (this time, the Soviets were aided by Lithuanians, who were promised Vilnius).[35]

Shortly after the defeat in the Battle of Warsaw in 1920, the withdrawing Red Army handed the city over to Lithuania, following the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of 12 July 1920.[36] The treaty allowed for the transfer to Lithuanian authority of some part of the areas of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The independence of the Baltic states was seen by Lenin as temporary. However, after the Battle of the Niemen River the Red Army was again defeated and Bolshevik Russia was forced to temporary abandon her plans for the reincorporation of all the lands lost by the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

As Russia ceased to be a major player in the area, Polish-Lithuanian relations worsened. In demographic terms Vilnius was one of the most Polonized and Russified[37][38] of Lithuanian cities during 1795-1914 Russian rule,[39] with Lithuanians constituting a mere fraction of the total population: 2% - 2,6% according to Russian (1897), German (1916) and Polish (1919) censuses. The latter two indicated that 50,1% or 56,2% of the inhabitants were Poles, while the Jewish share in the population amounted to 43,5% or 36,1%[40][41][42] (they were conducted after a large part of the inhabitants of Vilnius were evacuated to Russia,[43][44] mostly Voronezh[45] because of war in 1915). The Lithuanians nonetheless have a strong historical claim to the city (former capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the very centre of the formation of medieval Lithuanian state) and refused to recognize any Polish claims to the city and the surrounding area.[39] Lithuanian national activists, for example Mykolas Biržiška and Petras Klimas, supposed Poles and Belarusians in the Vilnius province to be ""Slavicized Lithuanians"" who, regardless of their individual preferences, must ""return to the language of their blood"".[46]

After the Bolshevik armies were pushed out of the area, the line reached by the Lithuanian forces before the Poles arrived was secured and diplomatic talks started. However, the negotiations on the future of the disputed area, held under the auspice of the Conference of Ambassadors in Brussels and Paris came to a stalemate and the Polish head of state, Józef Piłsudski feared, that the Entente might want to accept the fait accompli created by the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920. As both countries were officially at peace and the Lithuanian side rejected the idea of a plebiscite, the Poles decided to change the stalemate by creating a fait accompli for their own cause (see Polish–Lithuanian War).

On 9 October 1920, the 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division under General Lucjan Żeligowski seized the city in a staged mutiny. Vilnius was declared the capital of Republic of Central Lithuania, with Żeligowski as its head of state.[36][47] The negotiations in Brussels continued, but the Polish move complexified the situation. Among the plans proposed by the Entente was a creation of a Polish-Lithuanian state based on a cantonal system, with shared control over the disputed area. While this was acceptable to both sides, Poland insisted on inviting the Central Lithuanian representatives to the talks. Simultaneously, the Lithuanian politicians argued that Central Lithuania was but a puppet state of Poland and rejected the idea. Finally, the talks came to yet another stalemate and no agreement was reached.

On 8 January 1922, general parliamentary elections were held in Central Lithuania. Apart from the Lithuanian, Jewish and Belarusian organisations that eventually decided to boycott the voting, Poles, who took part in it supported the incorporation of the area into Poland – with different levels of autonomy. 64.4% of the entire population took part in the voting, and as much as 80.8% of Poles.[48] But among different ethnic groups the turnout was lower (41% of Belarusians, 15.3% Jews, 8.2% of Lithuanians and 66.2% of Tatars and Karaims).[48][49] This and the frauds noted by the Chief of Military control sent by League of Nations Col. Chardigny in his report were the pretexts for Lithuania not to recognise it. Also, the Lithuanian side argued that the election area covered only the territory of Central Lithuania, that is the areas under Lithuanian administration before Żeligowski's action, while it should also cover the areas promised to Lithuania in the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, known as the Vilnius region.[50][51][52]

Group of 32 Lithuanian activists, among them Mykolas Biržiška and Juozapas Kukta were deported to Lithuania on 6 February 1922, they were charged with espionage, what theoretically could be punished with death, but Polish officials just wanted to get rid of the most troublesome individuals, which anti-Polish activity was funded by the government in Kaunas.[53][54][55]

At the Central Lithuanian Parliament session on 20 February 1922, the decision was made to annex the whole area to Poland, with Vilnius becoming the capital of the Wilno Voivodship.[56][57]

The Council of Ambassadors and the international community (except for Lithuania) recognized Vilnius (Wilno) as part of Poland in 1923.[58][59] The Lithuanian authorities never accepted the status quo and continued to claim sovereignty over the Region of Vilnius. Also, the city itself was declared the constitutional capital of the Lithuanian state while Kaunas was only a temporary capital of Lithuania. Lithuania closed the border and broke all diplomatic relations with Poland. The two countries remained at the de facto state of war until the Polish ultimatum to Lithuania in 1938.

Poles together with Jews, made up a majority in the city of Vilnius itself. In the years 1920–1939, according to Polish statistics, Poles made up 65% of the population, Jews 28%, 4% Russians, 1% Belarusians 1% Lithuanians.[60] Most notable cases were political imprisonment of Lithuanian cultural figures in the late 1920s: Petras Kraujalis, Pranas Bieliauskas, Kristupas Čibiras, Vincas Taškūnas, Povilas Karazija, Juozas Kairiūkštis, Vytautas Kairiūkštis, Kostas Aleksa and others, political process of May 1925, where 22 Lithuanians, that were under the threat of the death penalty, but were saved by Tadeusz Wróblewski, etc.[61]

Ghetto benches were introduced at the university of Stephen Bathory. Moreover, members of the Camp of National Unity, which had an absolute majority in the Sejm since 1938, suggested to tractate Belarusians as a constituent part of the Polish nation and to assimilate them.[62] Romuald Jałbrzykowski cooperated with Ludwik Bociański and prohibited Catholic Belarusians to be members of Belarusian societies, thus until World War II only one Belarusian society (Belarusian Beekeepers' Society) remained.[63]

In spite of the unfavorable geopolitical situation (which prevented the trade with the immediate neighbors of Lithuania, Germany and Soviet Russia, life in the town flourished.[dubious – discuss][64][65] A new trade fair was created in 1928, the Targi Północne.[66] A number of new factories, including modern ""Elektrit"" radio factory was opened. Much of the development concentrated along the central Mickiewicz Street, where the modern Jabłkowski Brothers department store was opened, equipped with lifts and automatic doors. New radio buildings and towers were erected in 1927, including the site where noted Polish poet and Nobel Prize winner Czesław Miłosz worked. The city's university was reopened under the name Stefan Batory University, and Polish was reintroduced as the language of instruction.[67] By 1931 the city had 195,000 inhabitants, which made it the fifth-largest city in Poland.[citation needed] The city became an important centre of Polish cultural and scientific life, while economically the rest of the region remained relatively backward.[citation needed] It was claimed that this relative underdevelopment, among other issues, was the reason for difficulties with integrating the region and the city with Lithuania when it regained Vilnius in 1939.[citation needed]

Vilnius was also an informal capital of Yiddish at that time. The Museum of Jewish culture was founded there in 1919, and YIVO – Institute for Jewish Research, was founded there in 1924. Several important Jewish cultural institutions including theatres, newspapers and magazines, museums and schools, and Jewish PEN-Club were created before Second World War in Vilnius. Four YIVO directors emigrated to New York.[citation needed]

The Polish administration in the Vilnius Region carried out policy of polonization and ethnocide of Lithuanians, according to the Lithuanian historian Antanas Tyla [lt].[68] The situation of the Lithuanian minority worsened especially during the tenure of the Vilnius Voivode Ludwik Bociański, who, especially from 1936, introduced a policy of repression.[69] On 1936 February 11, a secret anti-Lithuanian memorandum called O posunięciach władz administracji ogólnej w stosunku do mniejszości litewskiej w Polsce oraz o zamierzeniach w tym wględzie na przyszłość (transl. About the actions of the general administration authorities in relation to the Lithuanian minority in Poland and about plans for the future in this regard) was issued by voivode Ludwik Bociański to the Polish administration, which stated the measures for suppressing the Lithuanian minority in Vilnius and the adjacent region, then under Polish control.[69][70] The execution of the secret anti-Lithuanian document, adopted by voivode Ludwik Bociański, resulted in closure of almost all Lithuanian schools, reading rooms, ban of Lithuanian organizations, while its members were imprisoned or deported.[71][72] As a result, at the beginning of the 1939/40 school year, Lithuanian education in Poland was limited to the only private primary school and a sole private secondary school, named after Vytautas the Great in Vilnius. In addition, in 102 state common schools with Polish as the language of instruction, Lithuanian language was virtually taught as a subject.[73][clarification needed]

At the beginning of the Second World War, Vilnius suffered from continuous German air raids. Despite German pressure, the Lithuanian government categorically declined the suggestions to participate in Germany's aggression against Poland. As a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, and subsequent Soviet invasion, the territories of Eastern Poland were occupied by the Red Army, which seized the city following a one-day defence on 19 September 1939. The Soviet Union threatened the Lithuanian side that the city would be incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR in case the Lithuanian side would not negotiate the future status of Vilnius according to the already prepared Soviet agenda.[74]

After talks in Moscow on 10 October 1939, the city and its surrounding areas were transferred to Lithuania according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. In exchange, Lithuania agreed to allow Soviet military bases to be established in strategic parts of the country. Lithuanian envoys were under pressure because at the same time there were talks about attaching the entire Vilnius region to the Belarusian Soviet Republic.[75] Only one-fifth of the Vilnius region was actually given back to Lithuania, even though the Soviets were recognizing the whole region as part of Lithuania when it was still under Polish control. The Polish envoy in Kaunas protested against the unlawful takeover of the city on October 13 and left Lithuania three days later, suspending once again diplomatic relations between both states.[76] This reunited Lithuanian Jews, although some people involved in Soviet activities decided to leave.[77] In few days, over 3000 Jews left Vilnius for the Soviet Union.[78] The Lithuanian army entered Vilnius on 28 October, but it was clear for Lithuanian officials that Vilnius could not be established as a capital without proper preparation.[79] So, for the time being, former Prime Minister Antanas Merkys was named special government representative for the city of Vilnius and the Vilnius region; he was later replaced by Kazys Bizauskas.

A month of Soviet rule in Vilnius had catastrophic consequences: the city was starving, the museums and archives looted, the valuables, industry[80] and historic documents were stolen and transferred to Russia, and many people were imprisoned or deported. Apparently, the Lithuanian government was deliberately slowing down the transfer of the capital back to Vilnius due to fears that the Soviet military presence around the city  would enable the Russians to overthrow the Lithuanian government if it were based there.

The annexation of Vilnius was greeted with rejoicing among Lithuanians; a whole generation was raised in the belief that Lithuania cannot be truly itself without the city of Vilnius – its capital, inscribed in The Act of reestablishment of independent Lithuania and the Constitution of Lithuania, so recent events were commonly perceived as an act of historical justice. The elites were far more concerned; for many, the price Lithuania paid to the Soviet Union for Vilnius was far too high; also they were aware of the demographic situation in Vilnius, and that Lithuanian rule in the city could face fierce resistance. Initially, the first encounter with the Lithuanian army and officials was calm and without any disturbance. Although the Polish bishop of Vilnius Romuald Jałbrzykowski refused to ring the bells of the city's churches.[81] But on the very next day October 29, clashes between a few Poles, mostly students, and a few Lithuanian policemen erupted, after the Lithuanians hoisted their flag above Gediminas Tower.[82]

After the Lithuanian army entered the city, at the end of October 1939, the demoralized Polish local population started a four-day-long anti-Jewish pogrom, in which one person lost their life and some 200 were wounded.[83][84]), the Jewish community asked nearby Russian military units for intervention. The violence only stopped after a group of 35 Soviet tanks briefly re-entered the city and put an end to the pogrom.[85] This prevented further pogroms, that were expected on the 10th–11 November, a traditional day of anti-Jewish disturbances in the city.[77]

The Lithuanian authorities started a campaign of de-occupation and de-Polonization of the city, similar policies also targeted the Jews.[83] Immediately upon entering the city, the Lithuanian authorities abolished the use of Polish złoty (as it was occupied by the Germans and the Soviets, Poland ceased to exist a month earlier and its currency crashed) and ordered the currency to be converted to Lithuanian litas, with only a 250% devaluation.[83] Soon other discriminatory[clarification needed] policies followed. During the several months-long period of retaking of Lithuanian capital, which from the Polish point of view was an unlawful occupation,[86] roughly 50,000 Lithuanians (mostly officials of state ministries and their family members) came to the capital city of Lithuanians.[87]

One of the decisions made by Lithuanian authorities in this period was the reformation of the Stefan Batory University into the Vilnius University on 15 December 1939. The same[clarification needed] decision was taken in the case of Society of Friends of Science (est. 1907), which had been permitted to function even under the oppressive Tsarist Russia rule and other Polish scientific institutions. In the process of Lithuanization Polish-language books were removed from stores[which?] and Polish street names were replaced with new ones in Lithuanian. Polish offices[which?], schools[which?], charitable[which?] social[which?] and cultural[which?] organizations, stores[which?] and businesses[which?] were closed[why?]. By June 1940 only two institutions in the entire city offered instruction in the Polish, while roughly 4000 Polish teachers lost their jobs.[87] The refugees, many of whom were Poles and Jews who moved to the city to avoid being captured by the Germans, were denied free movement, and by 28 March 1940, all people who had not been citizens of the town in October 1920, were declared to be refugees.[83] Altogether, some 12,000 people were granted Lithuanian citizenship, while 150,000 of the city's inhabitants, mostly Poles, were declared foreigners (as more than 100 thousand settled or were settled in Vilnius after the breach of Suwałki Agreement), excluded from many[quantify] jobs and even prohibited[better source needed] from riding on trains.[87]

The process of moving the capital was not yet finished when in June 1940, despite Lithuanian resistance,[citation needed] Vilnius was again seized by the Soviet Union and became the capital of the Lithuanian SSR. Approximately 35,000 – 40,000 of the city inhabitants were arrested by the NKVD and sent to gulags or deported to Siberia or Kazakhstan at that time.

In June 1941 the city was again seized by Nazi Germany. In the old town centre, two ghettos were set up for the large Jewish population – the smaller of which was ""liquidated"" by October. The second ghetto lasted until 1943, though its population was regularly decimated in so-called Aktionen. A failed Jewish ghetto uprising on 1 September 1943, could not prevent its final destruction.[citation needed] About 95% of the local Jewish population was murdered. Many of them were among 100,000 victims of the mass executions in Paneriai, about 10 kilometres west of the old town centre. Most of the remaining 30,000 victims of the massacre were Poles – POWs, intelligentsia and members of the Armia Krajowa, which at the time was fighting against both Germans and Lithuanians.

The Germans were forced to leave Vilnius in July 1944 by the combined pressure from the Polish Home Army (Operation Ostra Brama) and the Red Army (Battle of Vilnius (1944)). In 1944–1947 the opponents of the regime included were captured, interrogated in the NKVD Palace in Lukiškės Square, executed and buried in the Tuskulėnai Manor park.

The Soviets decided that Vilnius was to become again part of the Lithuanian SSR. After the end of World War II, the Soviet government unleashed a campaign to move political views further to the Left.[88] It demanded the transferring of Poles from the USSR and decided to transfer the Polish population from Lithuania and Belarus.[89] This decision was soon implemented and most of the population was expelled in an operation organized by Soviet and local communist authorities.[89] In some cases the transfer was voluntary, but not all willing people were able to leave because Poles living in rural areas were forced to remain where they had lived.[89][90]

Vilnius suffered relatively little wartime damage, and most of its buildings survived the war unscathed. However, the decade after the war, both ghetto areas with the famous Great Synagogue and the northern part of German street, as well as the whole quarter on Pilies street, were torn down.[91]

By the end of the war, only 111.000 people were left in Vilnius[92] (before 1939 the number was circa 200.000),[93] which had an obvious impact on the city's community and its traditions; what before the war was a Polish-Jewish[clarification needed] city with a tiny Lithuanian minority was instantly[specify] Lithuanized, with Lithuanians becoming the new majority.[89] Many[quantify] of the remaining Poles were arrested, murdered or sent to gulags or to remote parts of the Soviet empire. These events, coupled with the policy of Russification and immigration of Poles, Russians, Belarusians from other Soviet republics during post-war years, giving rise to a significant Russophone minority,[89] and slow but steady emigration of the surviving Jews to Israel, had a critical influence on the demographic situation of the city in the 1960s. Vilnius experienced a rapid population upsurge due to the inner migration of Lithuanians from the other parts of the country to the capital.

Beginning in 1987 there were massive demonstrations against Soviet rule in the country. 
On 23 August 1988, 150,000-200,000 people gathered in Vilnius.[94][95] On 11 March 1990, the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR announced its independence from the Soviet Union and restored the independent Republic of Lithuania. The Soviets responded on 9 January 1991, by sending in troops. On January 13, during the Soviet Army attack on the State Radio and Television Building and the Vilnius TV Tower, known as the January Events, 14 people were killed and more than 700 were seriously injured. The Soviet Union finally recognized Lithuanian independence in August 1991, after the Soviet coup attempt of 1991.

The importance of Vilnius for Belarus remained at the end of the 20th century. In June 1989 Vilnius was the site of the Belarusian Popular Front conference as the Belorussian Soviet authorities would not allow the event to take place in Belarus. At the beginning of the 21st century, several institutes such as the European Humanities University and the independent sociology centre NISEPI were persecuted in Belarus by the government of Alexander Lukashenko have found an asylum in Vilnius.

In the years following its independence, Vilnius has been rapidly evolving and improving, transforming from a Soviet-dominated enclave into a modern European city in less than 15 years.

In July 11–12, 2023, a NATO summit was held in Vilnius.[96]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Vilnius
List of heads of state of Lithuania,"The article is a list of heads of state of Lithuania over historical Lithuanian state. The timeline includes all heads of state of Lithuania as a sovereign entity, legitimately part of a greater sovereign entity, a client state, or a constituent republic subject to an outside authority. Currently, the head of state is the President of Lithuania.

During the inaugurations of Lithuanian monarchs until 1569, the Gediminas' Cap was placed on the monarch's heads by the Bishop of Vilnius in Vilnius Cathedral.[1]

Title: King of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos karalius). Dates are approximate because of scant written sources.

Title: Grand Duke (Lithuanian: didysis kunigaikštis; Belarusian: vialiki kniaź; Polish: wielki książę). Dates are approximate because of scant written sources.

The act of personal union with Poland was signed as early as 1385; however, the continuous line of common rulers of the two countries started only with Casimir IV (even then, Polish and Lithuanians twice selected different rulers following the death of an earlier common monarch, but the Lithuanian one always eventually assumed the Polish throne). The monarchs retained separate titles for both parts of the state, and their numbering was kept separate. The Jagiellon dynasty was a direct continuation of the Gediminids.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569. The elected King of Poland was automatically a Grand Duke of Lithuania (until then the Lithuanian dukedom was hereditary). The first common ruler of both countries was Sigismund II Augustus.

During the Deluge of the Second Northern War, Lithuania signed the Union of Kėdainiai with the Swedish Empire in 1655, thus de jure ending its union with Poland. However, due to Sweden's losses, the agreement soon fell out of favor and was not properly enforced, leading to the further continuation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the partitions in 1772, 1793, and 1795, the commonwealth ceased to exist and Lithuania proper became part of the Russian Empire for 123 years. There are some gaps in the timeline as it took a while to elect a new king. The first Grand Duke elected after the Gediminid line became extinct and after the Valois fled back to France was Stephen Báthory, who had made an effort to be recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania by establishing Vilnius University.

Title: King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania

Lithuanian: Lenkijos karalius ir Lietuvos didysis kunigaikštis

Polish: Król Polski, wielki książę litewski

Latin: Rex Poloniae et Magnus Dux Lituaniae

The Council of Lithuania declared independence on 16 February 1918 and invited Wilhelm of Urach to become king of Lithuania. The name of the state was the Kingdom of Lithuania. On 9 July 1918, Duke Wilhelm accepted the offer and took the name Mindaugas II. However, on 2 November the council revoked this decision as it was likely Germany would lose the war.

The state of Lithuania was ruled by the Presidium of the State Council of Lithuania, its chairman was de facto Head of State. The institution of President was established on 4 April 1919. Chairman of the Presidium Antanas Smetona was elected as First President of the State of Lithuania by the State Council of Lithuania and was the only one in under whose rule this position has been considered the office of the head of state.

The institution of President (Lithuanian: Prezidentas) was created on 4 April 1919. Antanas Smetona was elected as the first President of Lithuania.

Following Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union on 15 June 1940, in his telegram dated 31 May 1940, the last Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys provisioned that, in the event of occupation, Stasys Lozoraitis, minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Rome, be appointed the head of the Lithuanian diplomatic service. The Lithuanian diplomatic service became a Government in exile that was a critical piece to ensuring the recognition of the continuity of Lithuanian legal statehood until independence after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.[4]

The Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and established the Lithuanian SSR in July 1940.

Lithuanian: Lietuvos komunistų partijos Centro komiteto pirmasis sekretorius; Russian: Первый секретарь Центрального Комитета Коммунистической партии Литвы.

As Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, Lithuania liberated itself with the anti-Soviet June Uprising and re-declared Lithuanian Independence. Lithuania was ruled for some time by the Provisional Government of Lithuania, whose prime minister was Juozas Ambrazevičius. The Provisional Government was formed on 23 June 1941, but was dissolved on 5 August of the same year.

Lithuania was occupied by the Germans, who formed Generalbezirk Litauen on 25 July 1941, which was governed by the administration of general commissioner Adrian von Renteln and was a part of Reichskommissariat Ostland.

Lithuanian: Lietuvos generalinės srities generalinis komisaras; German: Generalkommissar des Generalbezirks Litauen.

As Nazi Germany retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied the country and reestablished the Lithuanian SSR in 1944. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet de jure acted as a collective head of state from 25 August 1940 to 11 March 1990. However, the Supreme Soviet de facto was controlled by the Communist Party of Lithuania led by the First Secretary.

The leader of the Supreme Council was the official head of state from the declaration of independence on 11 March 1990 until the new Constitution came into effect in 1992 establishing the office of President and the institution of Seimas. The state and its leadership were not recognized internationally until September 1991 [NB: Iceland was the first country to recognise the regained independence of Lithuania in February 1991.[5] Title from 1990 to 1992: Chairman of the Supreme Council (Parliament; Lithuanian: Aukščiausiosios Tarybos pirmininkas).

Lithuanian orthography,"Lithuanian orthography employs a Latin-script alphabet of 32 letters, two of which denote sounds not native to the Lithuanian language. Additionally, it uses five digraphs.

Today, the Lithuanian alphabet consists of 32 letters.  It features an unusual collation order in that ""Y"" occurs between I nosinė (Į) and J. While absent from the alphabet, letters Q, W and X have their place in collation order: Q is located between P and R, and W with X are preceded by letter V. Those letters may be used in spelling of foreign names.

The distinctive Lithuanian letter Ė was used for the first time in Daniel Klein's Grammatica Litvanica, and has been firmly established in the Lithuanian language since then.[1][2][3][4] However, linguist August Schleicher used Ë (with two points above it) instead of Ė for expressing the same.[5] In the Grammatica Litvanica Klein also established the  letter W for marking the sound V, the use of which was later abolished in the Lithuanian language (it was replaced with letter V, notably by authors of the Varpas newspaper).[1][5][6] The usage of letter V instead of W especially increased since the early 20th century, likely considerably influenced by Lithuanian press and schools.[6]

Due to the Polish influence, the Lithuanian alphabet included sz, cz and the Polish Ł for the sound [ɫ] and regular L (without a following i) for the sound [lʲ]: łupa, lutas.[3] During the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century the Polish Ł was abolished, while digraphs sz, cz (that are also common in the Polish orthography) were replaced with letters š and č from the Czech orthography, formally because they were shorter.[3][5][7] Nevertheless, another argument to abolish digraphs sz, cz was to distinguish the Lithuanian language from the Polish language.[5] The new letters š and č were cautiously used in publications intended for more educated readers (e.g. Varpas, Tėvynės sargas, Ūkininkas), however digraphs sz, cz continued to be in use in publications intended for less educated readers as š and č caused tension in society; š and č have prevailed only since 1906.[8][9]

The Lithuanians also adopted letter ž from the Czechs.[3][5]

The letters ą and ę were taken from the Polish spelling for what at the time were nasal vowels. They were first used by Renaissance Lithuanian writers. Later the letters į and ų were introduced for the remaining nasal vowels, which have since denasalized.[3][5] Letter ū is the latest addition by linguist Jonas Jablonskis.[3][5]

Acute, grave, and macron/tilde accents can mark stress and vowel length.  However, these are generally not used, except in dictionaries and where needed for clarity.  In addition, Lithuanian orthography uses five digraphs (Ch Dz Dž Ie Uo); these function as sequences of two letters for collation purposes.  The ""Ch"" digraph represents a voiceless velar fricative, while the others are straightforward compositions of their component letters. The letters F and H, as well as the digraph CH, denote sounds only appearing in loanwords.

Two spelling variants are used for foreign personal names: original spelling (e.g. George Walker Bush as a title of an encyclopedic article or as a name of an author of a book, or George'as Walkeris Bushas in a sentence, conforming to the Lithuanian morphology) and phonetic spelling adapted to the Lithuanian phonology (e.g. Džordžas Volkeris Bušas). In Soviet times, phonetic spelling was the only standard way to write foreign names in Lithuanian (original spelling could be shown in parentheses if needed), but in post-Soviet times the original spelling came to be widely used. The Lithuanian Wikipedia uses original spelling in article titles, but phonetic spelling in article texts.

The Lithuanian alphabet lacks Q (kū), W (vė dviguboji) and X (iks) of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. They are only used in foreign words and personal names of origin, as well as expressions and in international symbols.

⟨o⟩ is short only in loanwords. ⟨a e⟩ are always short without accent and under accent in endings -a, -e, -es,  in comparative, in pronouns, and in loanwords; otherwise, they are usually long.[10]

Consonants are always palatalized before ⟨e ę ė i į y⟩; before ⟨a ą o u ų ū⟩, palatalization is denoted by inserting an ⟨i⟩ between the consonant and the vowel.

The majority of the Lithuanian alphabet is in the Unicode block C0 controls and basic Latin (non-accented symbols), and the rest of the Lithuanian alphabet (Ą ą Č č Ę ę Ė ė Į į Š š Ų ų Ū ū Ž ž) is in the Latin Extended-A.

Demographic history of the Vilnius region,"The city of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, and its surrounding region has a long history. The Vilnius Region has been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the Lithuanian state's founding in the late Middle Ages to its destruction in 1795, i.e. five centuries. From then, the region was occupied by the Russian Empire until 1915, when the German Empire invaded it. After 1918 and throughout the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, Vilnius was disputed between the Republic of Lithuania and the Second Polish Republic. After the city was seized by the Republic of Central Lithuania with Żeligowski's Mutiny, the city was part of Poland throughout the Interwar period. Regardless, Lithuania claimed Vilnius as its capital. During World War II, the city changed hands many times, and the German occupation resulting in the destruction of Jews in Lithuania. From 1945 to 1990, Vilnius was the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital. From the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Vilnius has been part of Lithuania.

The population has been categorised by linguistic and sometimes also religious indicators. At the end of the 19th century the main languages spoken were Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian, Yiddish and Russian.[citation needed] Both Catholic and Orthodox Christianity were represented, while a large proportion of the city's inhabitants were Jews.[vague] The ""Lithuanian"" element was seen as declining, while the ""Slavic"" element was increasing.[citation needed]

Census data are available from 1897 onward, although the territorial boundaries and ethnic categorisation have been inconsistent. The Jewish population decreased greatly because of the Holocaust of 1941–44, and subsequently, many Poles were removed[vague] from the city, but less so from the surrounding countryside. Consequently, recent Census figures show a predominance of Lithuanians in the city of Vilnius, but of Poles in the Vilnius district outside the city.[vague]

Already in the 1st century, Lithuanian tribes inhabited Lithuania proper.[1] Slavicisation of Lithuanians in eastern and southeastern Lithuania began in the 16th century.[2] It is recorded that in 1554, Lithuanian, Polish and Church Slavonic were spoken in Vilnius.[3] The Statutes of Lithuania, officially enforced from 1588 until 1840, forbid Polish nobility to buy estates in Lithuania, hence a mass migration of Poles into the Vilnius region was impossible.[3] The Lithuanian nobility and Bourgeoisie was gradually Polonized over the 17th and 18th centuries.[3]

Until the end of the 19th century, Peasants in eastern Lithuania proper were Lithuanians.[3][4] This is attested by their un-Polonized surnames, and most Lithuanians in eastern Lithuania proper were Slavicized by schools and churches in the last quarter of the 19th century.[3][4]

Polonization resulted in the mixed language spoken in the Vilnius region by Tutejszy, where it was known as ""mowa prosta"".[5] It is not recognized as a dialect of Polish and borrows heavily from the Polish, Lithuanian and Belarusian languages.[5] According to Polish professor Jan Otrębski's article published in 1931, the Polish dialect in the Vilnius Region and in the northeastern areas in general are very interesting variant of Polishness as this dialect developed in a foreign territory which was mostly inhabited by the Lithuanians who were Belarusized (mostly) or Polonized, and to prove this Otrębski provided examples of Lithuanianisms in the Tutejszy language.[6][7] In 2015, Polish linguist Mirosław Jankowiak [pl] attested that many of the region's inhabitants who declare Polish nationality speak a Belarusian dialect which they call mowa prosta ('simple speech').[8]

In the eldership of Vilkpėdė, remnants of a Magdalenian settlement were found which date to c. 10000 BC. Around 1000 BC, the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia was densely inhabited by the Brushed Pottery culture, which had a half-hectare fortified settlement on Gediminas' Hill.[9] Tribes of this culture inhabited present-day Lithuania east of the Šventoji River and in western Belarus. The descendants of this culture were a Baltic tribe, the Aukštaitians (English: Highlanders).[9] According to historian Antanas Čaplinskas, who researched the surnames of Vilnius residents, the city's oldest surviving surnames are Lithuanian.[9] Pagan Lithuanians primarily lived at the northern foot of Gediminas' Hill and in the Crooked Castle.[10] Kairėnai, Pūčkoriai and Naujoji Vilnia had large settlements during the first millennium AD.[11] The most densely-populated area was the confluence of the Neris and Vilnia, which had fortified homesteads.[11]

Vilnius was part of the Kingdom of Lithuania; King Mindaugas did not permanently live there, however, despite building Lithuania's first Catholic church for his coronation.[12][11] The city began to develop in the late 13th century, during the reign of Grand Dukes Butvydas and Vytenis.[13]

Vilnius' growth is attributed to Grand Duke Gediminas, who invited knights, merchants, doctors, craftspeople and others to come to the duchy to practice their trades and religion without restriction during the 14th century.[11] However, the city's growth was limited by Teutonic Order attacks and the 1389–1392 Lithuanian Civil War.[11] Invited by Grand Duke Gediminas, merchants and craftsmen began moving to Vilnius from the cities of the German Hanseatic League, France, Italy and Spain; Lithuanian surnames were replaced with German, Polish, and Russian ones.[9] In the late 14th century, during the reign of Grand Duke Algirdas, Vilnius had a Ruthenian quarter (Latin: Civitas Ruthenica) in present-day Latako and Rusų Streets. Trade between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Ruthenian principalities was well-developed, with Ruthenian merchants and Ruthenian nobility living in the quarter.[9][10][14] Vilnius' multiculturalism was increased by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, who introduced Litvaks, Tatars and Crimean Karaites.[15] After several centuries, the number of local residents in Vilnius was smaller than the number of newcomers.[9] However, according to an analysis of the 1572 tax registers, Lithuania had 850,000 residents; 680,000 were Lithuanians.[16]

It became a multicultural city, with 14th-century sources noting that it consisted of a Great (Lithuanian) city and a Ruthenian one. By the 16th century, German merchants, artisans, Jews and Tatars had also settled in Vilnius. During the 16th– and 17th-century Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the city's Polish-speaking population began to grow; by the middle of the 17th century, most writing was in Polish.[11]
During the Lithuanian Golden Age, Vilnius was a major city in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and home to the Lithuanian nobility;[18][19] however, it was severely damaged by a 1610 fire.

After the 1655 Battle of Vilnius the city was under Russian control until 1661. During the Great Northern War, the Swedish Empire controlled Vilnius from 1702 to 1709. The occupation ended with the Great Northern War plague outbreak, and the city took over 50 years to recover.[11]  According to historian Vytautas Merkys, the city lost much of its old population under Swedish and Russian domination during the 17th and 18th centuries; although they were replaced by newcomers, Lithuanians continued to live in Vilnius.[9]

According to the first Commonwealth census in 1790, the Vilnius Voivodeship had a population of 718,571 and Vilnius County had 105,896 residents; after the Second Partition, the Grand Duchy had a population of 1,333,493.[16] The city's population fell to 17,500 in 1796 due to the 1794 uprising, the last attempt to save it from Russian control.[11][20] Vilnius was incorporated into the Russian Empire, and was its third-largest city at the beginning of the 19th century.[11] The city was again affected by the 1830 November Uprising and the January Uprising in 1863.[11] According to the 1897 Russian census, Vilnius had a population of 154,532 residents and the Vilna Governorate had 1,561,713.  Vilnius' population became ethnically less Lithuanian.[9] In the Russian census of 1897, 2.1 percent identified as Lithuanian speakers; speakers of Polish (30.8% percent) and Yiddish (40 percent) were the city's largest linguistic groups.[21] According to parish censuses in 1857–1858, the Lithuanian population was between 23.6 and 50 percent in the Vilna Governorate.[22] In 1863, ethnographer Roderich von Erckert identified the governate's largest ethnic group as Lithuanians (45.04 percent).[23] Among the szlachta (nobility) in Vilnius in the 1897 census were 5,301 (46 percent) local nobles and 6,403 (54 percent) newcomers; of the newcomers, 24.1 percent were from the Vilna Governorate and the remainder from Grodno, Minsk, Vitebsk and Kovno Governorates, Vistula Land and other regions.[24]

Most of the former lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were annexed by the Russian Empire during the Partitions in the late 18th century.

While initially, these former lands had certain local autonomy, with local nobility holding the same offices as before the Partitions, after several unsuccessful rebellions in 1830–31 and 1863–64 against the Russian Empire, the Russian authorities engaged in intense Russification of the regions' inhabitants.

Following the failed November uprising all traces of former Polish–Lithuanian statehood (like the Third Statute of Lithuania and Congress Poland) were replaced with Russian counterparts, ranging from the currency and units of measurement to offices of local administration. The failed January Uprising of 1863–64 further aggravated the situation, as the Russian authorities decided to pursue the policies of forcibly imposed Russification. The discrimination of local inhabitants included restrictions and bans on usage of Lithuanian (see Lithuanian press ban), Polish, Belarusian and Ukrainian (see Valuev circular) languages.[25][26][27][28] This however did not stop the Polonization effort undertaken by the Polish patriotic leadership of the Vilna educational district even within the Russian Empire.[29][30]

Despite that, the pre-19th-century cultural and ethnic pattern of the area was largely preserved. In the process of the pre-19th-century voluntary[31] Polonization, much of the Lithuanian nobility adopted Polish language and culture. This was also true to the representatives of the then-nascent bourgeoisie class and the Catholic and Uniate clergy. At the same time, the lower strata of the society (notably the peasants) formed a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural mixture of Lithuanians, Poles, Jews, Tatars and Ruthenians, as well as a small yet notable population of immigrants from all parts of Europe, from Italy to Scotland and from the Low Countries to Germany.

During the rule of the Russian tsars, Polish remained the Lingua franca as it had been in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the middle of the 17th century, most Lithuanian upper nobility was Polonized. Over time, the nobility of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth unified politically and started to consider themselves to be citizens of one common state. The leader of interwar Poland, the Lithuanian-born Józef Piłsudski, was an example of this phenomenon.[32]

Following is a list of censuses that have been taken in the city of Vilnius and its region since 1897. The list is incomplete. Data are at times fragmentary.

Michail Lebedkin used lists of the parish's inhabitants and judged their ethnicity based on their mother tongue.[3] Lebedkin considered Polish-speaking Catholics as Poles, yet the largest percentages of them were in districts of Dysna (43.4%), Vilnius (34.5%) and Vileyka (22.1%).[3] However, these districts were disconnected from ethnographic Poland and because there was no Polish colonisation, the sole conclusion is that the Polish-speaking Catholics were Polonized Lithuanians.[3]

In 1897, the first Russian Empire Census was held. The territory covered by the tables included parts of today's Belarus, that is, the Hrodna, Vitebsk and Minsk voblasts. Its results are currently criticised concerning ethnic composition because ethnicity was defined by the language spoken. In many cases, the reported language of choice was defined by general background (education, occupation) rather than ethnicity. Some results are also thought of as skewed since Pidgin speakers were assigned to nationalities arbitrarily. Moreover, the Russian military garrisons were counted in as permanent inhabitants of the area. Some historians point out the fact that the Russification policies and persecution of ethnic minorities in Russia were added to the notion to subscribe Belarusians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians and Poles to the category of Russians.[34][35][36]

Russian Population Figures for the 1897 Census:

During World War I, all of modern-day Lithuania and Poland was occupied by the German Army. On 9 March 1916, the German military authorities organized a census to determine the ethnic composition of their newly conquered territories.[41] Many Belarusian historians note that the Belarusian minority is not noted among the inhabitants of the city.[citation needed]

The census was organised by Oberbürgermeister Eldor Pohl. Representatives of local population were included in the commission. Poles were represented by Jan Boguszewski, Feliks Zawadzki and Władysław Zawadzki, Jews by Nachman Rachmilewicz, Simon Rosenbaum and Zemach Shabad, Lithuanians by Antanas Smetona, Aleksandras Stulginskis and Augustinas Janulaitis. Belarusians did not have any representation.[42] Each member of the commission was responsible for the census in one of the nine parts into which the city was divided, and was accompanied by two representatives of other nationalities. As a result each part of the city was entrusted to commission consisted of one Pole, Jew and Lithuanian.[43] Each commission had an ethnically mixed team of clerks at their disposal. Overall 425 of them were engaged in carrying out the census; 200 of them were Jews, 150 Poles, 50 Lithuanians and 25 Belarusians.[43] Many Lithuanians at the time pointed to the fact, that many of the clerks employed in carrying out the census were Polish citizen of Germany, mainly from Poznań, so the results of the census were unreliable.[44]

Census itself was carried out in days 9–11 March, for 5 more days people were able to correct their declarations and make complaints.[45] The main complain was that many of the clerks, mainly Jewish ones, did not know any other language other than Yidish or Russian, often also didn't know latin script, which in effect let to many mistakes, also many people simply refused to answer the questions they didn't understand.[46] There were also instances when for political reasons people were registered as belonging to different nationality than they declared.[47] Overall according to census city was inhabited by 140 480 people, 76 196 of them were Roman Catholics (54,10%), 70 692 were Polish (50,15%). The second group were Jews, 61 265 declared such nationality (43,5%) and 61 233 declared Judaism as their religion (43,47%).[48] The population of the city decreased from 205 300 in 1909 to just 140 800 registered in the new census. Almost all of Russians left the city with the army, their percentage shrank from 20% in 1909 to just 1,46% now.[49]

In comparison with the first Germans census (carried out in November 1915, wasn't asking about nationality), the number of inhabitants decreased by 1,223 from 142,063.[50] The most striking result was the difference in the number of inhabitants and the number of people registered for food ration stamps. According to responsible office in March 1916 there was 170 836 people in the city eligible to receive food rations, which gave the difference of about 18%.[51] German authorities alarmed by the results reformed the rationing system and in October the number of stamps was reduced so the number of registered persons decreased to 142 218.[52] Given people were rather leaving Vilnius — refugees were going back to their homes, people were trying to find better life conditions in the countryside — the numbers were still most likely inflated.[52] In a result Germans decided to carry out additional census.

Every inhabitant of Vilnius was ordered to appear in the right office with a passport and a ration card. In front of ethnically mixed commission he needed to declare his and his family nationality and religion, and also declare the number of people in the household. After that he was given a new ration card where such information was included. Results were even more favourable for Poles, their number increased to 74,466 (53.65%), while the overall number of people in the city decreased to 138,787.[53]

AData collected from the following districts (Kreise): Suwałki, Augustów, Sejny, Grodno, Grodno-city, Płanty [be], Lida, Radun, Vasilishki, Vilnius-city, Vilnius, Širvintos, Pabradė, Merkinė, Molėtai, Kaišiadorys, and Švenčionėliai.[55][57]

A similar census was organized for all of the territories of German-occupied Lithuania, and the northern border of the territory was more or less correspondent to that of present-day Lithuania; however, its southern border ended near Brest-Litovsk, and included the city of Białystok.[citation needed]

The Peace of Riga, which ended the Polish–Soviet War, determined Poland's eastern border. In 1921, the first Polish census was held in territories under Polish control. However, Central Lithuania, seized in 1920 by General Lucjan Żeligowski's forces after a staged mutiny, was outside of de jure Poland. Poland annexed the short-lived state on 22 March 1922.

As a result, the Polish census of 20 September 1921 covered only parts of the future Wilno Voivodeship area, that is the communes of Breslauja, Duniłowicze [pl], Dysna and Vileika.[58] The remaining part of the territory of Central Lithuania (that is the communes of Vilnius, Ašmena, Švenčionys and Trakai) was covered by the additional census organised there in 1923. The tables on the right give the combined numbers for Wilno Voivodeship's area (Administrative Area of Wilno), taken during both the 1921 and 1923 censuses. It is known that Lithuanians were forced to declare their nationality as Polish.[59]

The 1931 Polish census was the first Polish census to measure the population of the whole Wilno and Wilno Voivodeship at once. It was organised on 9 December 1931 by the Main Statistical Office of Poland. However, in 1931 the question of nationality was replaced by two separate questions of religion worshipped and the language spoken at home.[61] Because of that, it is sometimes argued that the ""language question"" was introduced to diminish the number of Jews, some of whom spoke Polish rather than Yiddish or Hebrew.[61] The table on the right shows the census findings on language. Wilno voivodeship did not include Druskininkai area and included just a small part of Varėna area where the majority of inhabitants were Lithuanians. Even then, some Lithuanians were recorded as belonging to the Polish nationality.[59] The voivodeship, however, included Brelauja, Dysna, Molodečno, Ašmena, Pastovys and Vileika counties which now belong to Belarus.

In stark contrast to the Polish interwar censuses, the Vilnius region was the site of 30 Lithuanian Kindergartens, 350 Lithuanian Primary schools, 2 Lithuanian gymnasiums and a Lithuanian teacher's seminary, all of which indicate that there were far more Lithuanians in the Vilnius region than the censuses accounted for.[3]

Lithuanians troops who entered Vilnius in 1939 had to resort to French and German to communicate with the city's inhabitants. According to the official Lithuanian data from 1939, Lithuanians made up 6% of Vilnius population.[63] A Lithuanian sanitary platoon didn't find any Lithuanian-speaking villages despite traveling for two weeks in the surrounding countryside.[64]
In December 1939, shortly after the return of Lithuanian control to what it claimed was its capital city, the Lithuanian authorities organized a new census in the area. However, the census is often criticized as skewed, intending to prove Lithuania's historical and moral rights to the disputed area rather than determine the factual composition.[65] Lithuanian figures from that period are criticized as significantly inflating the number of Lithuanians.[66]
People receiving Lithuanian citizenship were pressured to declare their nationality as being Lithuanian rather than Polish.[64]

After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War in 1941, the area of eastern Lithuania was quickly seized by the Wehrmacht. On 27 May 1942 a new census was organised by the German authorities and the local Lithuanian collaborators.[67] The details of the methodology used are unknown[further explanation needed] and the results of the census are commonly believed[by whom? – Discuss] to be an outcome of the racial theories and beliefs of those who organised the census rather than the actual ethnic and national composition of the area.[67] Among the most notable features is a complete lack of data on the Jewish inhabitants of the area (see Ponary massacre for explanation) and a much lowered number of Poles, as compared to all the earlier censuses.[68][69]
However, Wilna-Gebiet did not include Breslauja, Dysna, Maladečina, Pastovys and Vileika counties but included Svieriai [lt] district. That explains the decline in the number of Belarusians in Wilna-Gebiet.

Einsatzgruppen population report on 1 July 1941 [66]

Vilnius' registered population was about 107,000. People who moved to the city during the German occupation, military personnel, and temporary residents were not included in the population count. According to the data from the beginning of 1945, the total population of Vilnius, Švenčionys and Trakai districts amounted to 325,000 people, half of them Poles.[72] About 90% of the Vilnius Jewish community had perished in the Holocaust. All Vilnius Poles were required to register for resettlement, and about 80% of them were relocated to Poland.[73]

Soviet census of late 1944-early 1945:A[74]

AIn the Trakai and Švenčionys districts, a certain number of Belarusians was included into the categories of Russians and Poles.[74]

During the 1944-1946 period, about 50% of the registered Poles in Lithuania were transferred to Poland. Dovile Budryte estimates that about 150,000 people left the country.[75] During 1955–1959 period, another 46,600 Poles left Lithuania. However, Lithuanian historians estimate that about 10% of people who left for Poland were ethnic Lithuanians[citation needed]. While the removal[dubious – discuss] of Poles from Vilnius constituted a priority[dubious – discuss] for the Lithuanian communist authorities, the depolonization of the countryside was limited due to the concerns of depopulation and agricultural labour force deficit. The population transfers and migration processes resulted in the formation of territorial ethnic segregation, with Lithuanians and Russians prevailing in Vilnius and Poles predominating in the city's surroundings.[76][77]

These are the results of the migration to Poland and the growth of the city due to industrial development and the Soviet Union policy.

Poles accounted for 63.6% of the population in Vilnius rayon/county (currently Vilnius district municipality, excluding the city of Vilnius itself), and 82.4% of the population in Šalčininkai rayon/county (currently known as Šalčininkai district municipality).[79]

The city's population increased to 205,300 in 1909.[22][82]

During World War I, thousands of residents were forced to flee, were killed, or were taken to labor camps; the city's 1919 population fell to 128,500.[11][86] Vilnius recovered during the interwar period, with 209,442 residents in 1939,[87] but its population fell to 110,000 in 1944.[11]

The city's population increased as the capital of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic; according to the 1989 census, it had 576,747 residents.[11] Although Lithuania experienced much emigration after independence in 1990, Vilnius' population was almost unchanged (542,287 in 2001) and has increased every year since 2006; its 1 January 2020 population was 580,020.[11][88]

The city's Lithuanian population reached a record low in 1931 (0.8 percent); Poles numbered 65.9 percent after the 1922 annexation of Vilnius Region by Poland and the Lithuanian retreat from the region to the temporary capital of Kaunas.[89]

After the 1939 Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty, Lithuania regained one-third of Vilnius Region and tried to Lithuanize Vilnius by introducing Lithuanian laws.[90] Prime Minister Antanas Merkys said that this was ""to make everybody think like Lithuanians. First of all, it was and still is necessary to comb out the foreign element from the Vilnius Region"".[90] The Lithuanian government enacted a law in which those ""who on 12 July 1920 (...) were regarded as Lithuanian nationals, and on 27 October 1939 were resident in the territory became Lithuanian nationals"".[91][92] About 150,000 Poles were repatriated from the Lithuanian SSR from 1945 to 1956.[90] Nearly the entire Jewish population was exterminated during the Holocaust in Lithuania.[89]

After World War II, the number of ethnic Lithuanians in Vilnius rebounded; however, Lithuanization was replaced with Sovietization.[89][93] Following independence in 1990, Vilnius' ethnic-Lithuanian population increased to 63.2 percent in 2011 and 67.44 percent in 2021.[94][95][96]

The Jews living in Vilnius had their own complex identity, and labels of Polish Jews, Lithuanian Jews or Russian Jews are all applicable only in part.[103] The majority of the Yiddish speaking population used the Litvish dialect.

The Vilnius urban region is the only area in East Lithuania that doesn't face a decrease in population density. Polish people constitute the majority of native rural inhabitants in the Vilnius region. However, the share of Poles across the region is dwindling mainly due to the natural decline of rural population and process of suburbanization – most of new residents in the outskirts of Vilnius are Lithuanians.[77]

Most Poles in the area today speak a dialect known as the simple speech (po prostu).[104] Colloquial Polish in Lithuania includes dialectic qualities and is influenced by other languages.[105] Educated Poles speak a language close to standard Polish.[citation needed]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_the_Vilnius_region

Wojski,"A wojski (Lithuanian: Vaiskis; Medieval Latin: tribunus, hence sometimes rendered into English as tribune) was an officer in medieval Poland and later in Lithuania, responsible for the security of voivodeships or districts at times when voivods and castellans had accompanied the szlachta (nobility) to war.

With time, the wojski's responsibilities were taken over by starostas, and wojski became an honorary district office in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojski

Catholic Church in Lithuania,"The Catholic Church in Lithuania (Lithuanian: Katalikų Bažnyčia Lietuvoje) is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome.[2] Lithuania is the world's northernmost Latin Catholic-majority country.[3] Pope Pius XII gave Lithuania the title of ""northernmost outpost of Catholicism in Europe"" in 1939.[4][5] The Vilnius Cathedral is the most important Catholic Church in Lithuania, which was previously used for the inauguration ceremonies of Lithuanian monarchs with Gediminas' Cap, while in modern times it is a venue for masses dedicated to the elected Presidents of Lithuania after their inauguration ceremonies and giving of oaths to the Nation in the Seimas Palace.[6][7][8][9][10][11]

Among the Baltic states, Lithuania is the country with the highest percentage of Catholic population.[12] Almost three-quarters (74.19%) of Lithuania's population self-identified as Catholics in the 2021 census.[13] The country is divided into eight dioceses including two archdioceses and a military ordinariate.[14]

St. Casimir (Kazimieras, 1458–1484) is the only canonized saint of Lithuania.[15][16] He is the patron of the country and Lithuanian youth.[15][17][16] Polish saint Raphael Kalinowski was born in Lithuania's capital Vilnius, then controlled by the Russian Empire. Archbishop Jurgis Matulaitis-Matulevičius (1871–1927) was beatified in 1987, archbishop Teofilius Matulionis (1873–1962) was beatified in 2017.[18][19]

Saint Bruno of Querfurt, a missionary bishop, was martyred in 1009 for proclaiming the Christian faith.[20] While some historians assert that he was killed by the Lithuanians, Zigmas Zinkevičius disputes this, arguing that Bruno met his death in territories inhabited by the Yotvingians.[21] It was in connection with this event that the name of Lithuania was first recorded.[22]

The spread of Catholicism in Lithuania began in the 13th century.[23] During the reign of Mindaugas (r. 1230s–1263), the Dominican Order and the Franciscans started establishing their presence in the region.[24][25] In 1231, Saint Hyacinth of Poland, a Dominican, arrived in Lithuania.[24] In 1251, a delegation sent by Mindaugas informed Pope Innocent IV of the ruler’s desire to be baptized as a Roman Catholic.[26][27] The Pope warmly welcomed Lithuania’s conversion, issuing no fewer than six papal bulls on the matter.[27] In the first half of 1251, Mindaugas, along with many of his subjects—including a portion of the Lithuanian nobility—embraced Roman Catholicism through baptism.[27][28]

The baptism of the ruler marked Lithuania’s emergence as an officially Catholic nation, gaining international recognition as early as the 1250s.[26][27] In response, Pope Innocent IV instructed Heidenreich, the Bishop of Chełmno, to crown Mindaugas with a royal crown in the Pope’s name.[27] On July 6, 1253, Mindaugas was crowned King of Lithuania, and his wife, Morta, became Queen.[27] On August 21 of the same year, the Pope appointed Christian of Oliva as the first Bishop of Lithuania, thereby establishing the Diocese of Lithuania.[29] According to the Lithuanian bishop Jonas Boruta,

""A separate diocese directly subordinate to the Pope is already a considerable step for the creation of an ecclesiastical province, and in the Lithuania of Mindaugas' time (if not for unfortunate political events - the murder of Mindaugas, etc.) there were all the conditions for the establishment of an ecclesiastical province as well..""[30]

Following Mindaugas’ assassination, Treniota seized power in 1263 and ruled Lithuania for approximately a year, during which he initiated a persecution of Christians.[23] After Treniota’s death in 1264, Lithuania came under the rule of Mindaugas’ son, Vaišvilkas (r. 1264–1267), and subsequently Mindaugas’ son-in-law, Shvarn (r. 1267–1269), both of whom adhered to the Orthodox faith.[23] Shvarn’s reign ended amid internal power struggles, and the succeeding Grand Dukes of Lithuania reverted to pagan beliefs.[23]

In the 14th century, Lithuania’s pagan rulers, like Vytenis and Gediminas, constructed Catholic churches and welcomed Catholic priests and monks.[31] For instance, Vytenis (r. 1295–1316) built a Catholic church in Naugardukas and requested two Franciscan monks to manage it. However, knights from the Teutonic Order later destroyed the church.[23]

Gediminas (r. 1316–1341), Vytenis’ pagan successor, allied with the Archbishop of Riga against the Teutonic Order.[23] This partnership began in 1298, allowing Riga’s Franciscans and Dominicans to work freely in Lithuania.[23] Later, Archbishop Friedrich von Pernstein [de] successfully set up Franciscan and Dominican monasteries in Lithuanian cities.[23] These monks were active on Gediminas’ lands.[23] In Vilnius, two churches were built—one for the Dominicans and one for the Franciscans.[23] Encouraged by these monks and driven by political aims, Gediminas wrote to the Pope in 1322, promising to convert to Roman Catholicism.[23] In 1323, he sent letters to monastery leaders in Western Europe, inviting priests, monks, and lay Christians to Lithuania with a promise of religious freedom.[23]

In June 1324, the Pope promised to send legates to Gediminas, and they reached Riga by autumn.[23] Gediminas refused baptism and acted as if he never promised to convert.[23] He blamed the confusion on a Franciscan who wrote the letter to the Pope.[23] Despite this, the monks kept working to spread Catholicism in Lithuania.[23]

Gediminas’ sons, Algirdas and Kęstutis, ruled Lithuania together from 1345 to 1377 and stayed pagan their whole lives.[23] Algirdas, who married Duchess Maria of Vitebsk in 1318, inherited the Principality of Vitebsk in 1320, allowed his children to be baptized Orthodox, and set up the Orthodox Metropolis of Lithuania in the Rus’ lands under his control.[23] Kęstutis was encouraged by the Pope and neighboring rulers like Casimir III of Poland, to become baptised.[23]

In 1351, Louis I (later king of Poland) pushed Kęstutis to get baptized.[23] Kęstutis agreed, but only if Louis returned lands taken by the Teutonic Order and guaranteed his coronation. They swore oaths to the deal, but Kęstutis never went through with baptism.[23]

In 1358, Emperor Charles IV urged both Algirdas and Kęstutis to become Catholic.[23] They promised to convert if the Teutonic Order’s conquered lands were returned and the Order was sent east to fight the Golden Horde Tatars.[23] The deal fell apart, so they stayed pagan.[23]

Though Kęstutis remained pagan, his daughter Danutė was baptized in the 1370s when she married Janusz I, Duke of Masovia.[23] Pope Gregory XI tried to baptize Lithuania in 1373, but that effort failed too.[23]

Grand Dukes Jogaila (Algirdas’ son) and Vytautas the Great (Kęstutis’ son) worked to bring Christianity to Lithuania.[23] On October 31, 1382, Jogaila signed the Treaty of Dubysa with the Teutonic Order, promising to give them Samogitia up to the Dubysa River in exchange for their help against Kęstutis and Vytautas. He also pledged to be baptized with his followers within four years.[23] When Jogaila didn’t follow through in 1383, the Order backed Vytautas instead.[23] Vytautas was baptized as a Roman Catholic named Wigand on October 21, 1383, in Tepliava.[23] He promised the Order Samogitia up to the Nevėžis River and received control of three castles near the Nemunas River.[23]

In 1385, Jogaila agreed to the Act of Krėva, marrying Queen Jadwiga of Poland (daughter of Louis I of Hungary) and becoming King of Poland. He accepted Roman Catholicism and was baptized as Ladislaus on February 15, 1386, in Kraków, alongside his brothers and cousin Vytautas, who took the name Alexander.[23] In 1387, Jogaila and Bishop Andrzej Jastrzębiec arrived in Vilnius with Lithuanian-speaking Franciscans to baptize Lithuania, mainly Aukštaitija.[23][32] On February 17, 1387, Jogaila issued a privilege to support Vilnius Cathedral. The Vilnius diocese was established by Pope Urban VI on March 12, 1388.[33] Jogaila helped build churches in places like Maišiagala, Medininkai, and Obolcai, setting up a chapter with a provost, dean, and 10 canons.[23] Most of the clergy were Poles.[23] The first Franciscan monasteries were also founded during this time.[25]

A delegation of Samogitian nobles attended the Council of Constance in 1417 to demonstrate that Jogaila and Vytautas were overseeing the baptism of the Samogitians and to demand that Samogitia remain under Vytautas' governance.[23] Additionally, they requested that the future Samogitian diocese be established under the supervision of the bishops of Vilnius and Lviv.[23] When the Teutonic Order prevented a delegation appointed by the Council from traveling to baptize Samogitia, the bishops of Vilnius and Lviv carried out the task.[23] The baptism of Samogitia took place in 1417, and the Samogitian diocese, based in Medininkai, was founded in 1421 under Pope Martin V.[23][34] A chapter of six canons was also established, with Matthias of Trakai consecrated as the first bishop of Samogitia. In 1422, Matthias became the bishop of Vilnius, and later, in 1453, the bishop of Lutsk, ensuring that ordained priests spoke Lithuanian.[23][35] Until 1795, both the Vilnius and Samogitian dioceses were part of the ecclesiastical province of Gniezno.[31]

With the support of rulers such as Vytautas and Jogaila, the number of churches in Lithuania grew rapidly.[23] By the late 14th century, the Vilnius diocese had 17 churches, five of which were in Vilnius itself.[23] Polish historian Jerzy Ochmański notes that by 1392, 10 parishes had been established, increasing to 27 across the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Vytautas' death in 1430.[33] By the end of the 15th century, Lithuania had 109 churches—91 in the Vilnius diocese and 18 or 19 in the Samogitian diocese, seven of which were founded by Vytautas.[23][36] Between then and the mid-16th century, 103 churches were built in the Vilnius diocese and 38 in the Samogitian diocese.[23] Around 1500, the Vilnius diocese alone boasted 130 churches.[37]

As dioceses were being established, churches were primarily constructed and endowed by rulers, and later by magnates and nobles.[23] Rulers typically granted land to churches, generating income to sustain parish clergy and maintain buildings, while noble endowments provided funds and church supplies.[23] Noble founders and their heirs often retained the jus patronatus, ensuring the parish was staffed with a clergyman.[23]

In 1501, Erazm Ciołek, a provost of Vilnius Cathedral, informed the Pope that Lithuanians preserved and respected their native language (Linguam propriam observant), but also used Ruthenian for practical reasons, as nearly half of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania spoke it.[39] In the 16th century, as the use of Polish increased, the Lithuanian language reached status of literary language.[39] In 1599, Mikalojus Daukša published his Postil and, in its prefaces, noted the improved status of Lithuanian, crediting Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis for his efforts.[39]

Between 1530 and 1540, Reformation and humanist ideas spread into the Grand Duchy, reaching its peak around 1570.[23][31] Lutheranism dominated at first, followed by Calvinism.[20] This era saw a rise in education and book publishing, including the first Lithuanian printed book – Catechism by Lutheran pastor Martynas Mažvydas in 1547.[20] During the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church intensified efforts against Arianism and other Protestant movements.[23][31]  Protestant churches and schools were shut down, and much of the Lithuanian nobility, most notably the Nyasvizh branch of the Radziwiłł family, including Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł the Orphan and Cardinal Jerzy Radziwiłł, converted to Catholicism.[23][31]

In 1569, at the initiative of Bishop Walerian Protasewicz, the Jesuits were invited to Vilnius. As they learned the vernacular languages, they began preaching to the local population in their native Lithuanian language, reinforcing the Counter-Reformation effort.[20] Spaniards, Italians, Germans, and Poles began learning Lithuanian in the 1570s, and the first foreigners who learned the language were the Spaniards, who learned it to preach and listen to confessions in Lithuanian.[40] Sometimes they went to the surrounding villages and sometimes organized sermons in Vilnius' streets.[40] Records of Lithuanian Jesuit preachers in Vilnius – with only minor gaps – have survived up to the 18th century.[40] In 1582, Cardinal Jerzy Radziwiłł founded the Vilnius Theological Seminary.[20] Bishop Merkelis Giedraitis (1576–1609), a leading advocate of Catholicism in Samogitia, supported the seminary by sending his clerics there. He also built twelve churches and established new parishes in the region.[20]

The Third Statute of Lithuania, published in 1588, guaranteed equal rights for Catholics, Protestants, and Eastern Orthodox within the Grand Duchy.[23][31]  The Union of Brest in 1596 marked the ecclesiastical union of the Orthodox Church in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth with Rome.[20][31]

The construction of churches funded by noble patrons and the founding of new monasteries intensified significantly in the 17th and 18th centuries. Schools, hospitals, and shelters were often established alongside them.[20][23][31] Most Dominican monasteries in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were founded in the 17th century.[24] Until the fall of the Lithuanian state in 1795, monasteries gained substantial influence, as monks became active in all areas of religious and cultural life.[23]

The officially Catholic Grand Duchy of Lithuania ceased to exist after the Third Partition of Poland–Lithuania in 1795, carried out by the Protestant Kingdom of Prussia and the Eastern Orthodox Russian Empire.[20] Most Lithuanian territories fell under Russian control.[23] Empress Catherine II of Russia established the Archdiocese of Mogilev in 1782 for her new Catholic subjects.[31]

During the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, during which the Vilnius uprising also took place, Catholic sermons supporting the insurrection were preached in various languages, including Lithuanian (e.g., by Michał Franciszek Karpowicz), both in churches (e.g., the Church of St. Johns in Vilnius) and among military units.[41][42][43][44]

After the uprisings of 1831 and 1863, the tsar's repression against the Catholic Church intensified, and monasteries were closed en masse.[20][31][23] These monasteries were previously very involved in religious and cultural activities throughout the former Lithuanian lands and were responsible for many schools, libraries, and charity institutions.[23] During the years of Russian rule, a struggle began within the Catholic Church for the rights of faith and Lithuanian national identity, which were persistently defended by Bishop of Samogitia Motiejus Valančius.[23] Valančius spread faith, sobriety, and literacy among Lithuanians.[20]

Lithuania regained its independence in 1918 and successfully defended it in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. The Vatican recognized Lithuania's independence de jure in 1922.[20] A concordat was signed in 1927 between Lithuania and the Holy See.[20][31]

After the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in the summer of 1940, the Church began to be persecuted.[20][31] The Church and state were separated.[31] The concordat and diplomatic relations with the Vatican were terminated.[20][31] Church property was confiscated, religious education in schools was stopped, publishing of Catholic books and newspapers was banned.[20][31] Dominican monasteries were also closed down.[24] On 11–12 July 1940, many prominent Lithuanian public figures were arrested, including Catholic priests.[31] During the Soviet mass deportation from Lithuania on 14–15 June 1941, 9 Lithuanian Catholic priests were deported.[31] In the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in late June 1941, a total of 15 Lithuanian Catholic priests were murdered.[31] On June 22, priests Justinas Dabrila, Vaclovas Balsius and Jonas Petrikas in Būdavonė forest (Bartninkai district) were martyred by NKVD soldiers.[31]

During the second Soviet occupation, which began once the Red Army invaded Lithuanian lands in 1944, the persecution of the Church intensified.[20][31] This was because of the regime's state atheism, as well as the Catholic Church's involvement in the Lithuanian anti-communist guerrilla war against Soviet occupation.[31] Mass arrests and deportations of Lithuanian citizens, priests and believers, were carried out.[20][31] Churches were closed down.[31] The restrictions on the church's activities intensified, especially restricting the training of new clergy.[31] In 1946, the bishop of Telšiai Vincentas Borisevičius was arrested and sentenced to death.[31] Later, the bishops Teofilius Matulionis, Pranciškus Ramanauskas, Vilnius archbishop Mečislovas Reinys were arrested and imprisoned.[31] The Soviet state seized the Vilnius Cathedral from the Catholic Church in 1950.[31]

In the 1970s, the Catholic Church's underground activity intensified, as underground Catholic newspapers and magazines began to be published, and priests were trained underground.[31] In 1972, the underground publication Chronicle of the Catholic Church of Lithuania began to be published.[31] The number of initiatives to defend religious freedom increased.[20]

Also during the Communist time, Apostolic Visitors were designated by the Holy See for the Lithuanian Roman Catholics in diaspora.[citation needed]

The nationally renowned anti-Communist resistance shrine, the Hill of Crosses, upon which thousands of Latin Rite crosses of all sizes have been placed, is located near the city of Šiauliai. Erecting Latin crosses on the hill was forbidden by the Czarist Russian Orthodox authorities in the 19th century. Later, in the 20th century, the Soviet authorities also forbade such explicit religious symbols. The crosses were removed in 1961 with tractors and bulldozers, but despite Soviet prohibitions, Catholics continued to put small crucifixes and larger crosses on the Hill of Crosses. Pope John Paul II visited the hill during his visit to Lithuania, primarily because it was a sign of anti-Communist Catholic resistance, as well as a Catholic religious site. Lithuania was the only majority-Catholic Soviet republic.[45][46]

Lithuania regained its independence once more in 1990, during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Catholic Church is an influential factor in the country, and some priests actively led the resistance against the Communist regime and, after independence was regained, in support of traditionalism, especially in ethical questions.[citation needed]

In 1993, Pope John Paul II visited Lithuania and after his prayer in the Chapel of Saint Casimir in the Vilnius Cathedral said that ""the heart of the Lithuanian nation beats in this sanctuary"".[47]

The Catholic Church in Lithuania has after independence continued to campaign against liberal and socialist measures, especially in ethical questions.[citation needed]

The treaties of the Holy See and the Republic of Lithuania entered into force in 2000.[20] Since then, the relations between the Catholic Church and the Lithuanian state have been regulated by three special treaties of the Republic of Lithuania and the Holy See, instead of the concordat.[31]

Christian culture was spread in Lithuania through schools.[23] Until the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, education was mainly taken care of by the Catholic Church.[23] Initially, the first schools operated in Vilnius near the Franciscan monastery and cathedral.[23] Vytautas settled the Benedictines in Senieji Trakai in 1409, where it was sought that they would open a school as well.[23] A parish school for the townspeople was established, near the Church of St. Johns, Vilnius, in 1413.[23] More schools appeared in the 15th and 16th centuries.[20] In 1534, the Synod of Vilnius ordered priests to establish schools.[23] The church leadership ordered in 1607 the establishment of primary schools in all parishes, while the higher schools were maintained by Jesuits, Piarists and other monks.[23] In the 18th century, there were about 300 parochial schools in Lithuania, with 5,000 students.[23]

The Jesuits establish a college in Vilnius in 1570.[31] The Vilnius Academy was founded in 1579 by the Jesuits through the reorganization of the college they established nine years prior.[31] The university trained Lithuanian clergymen and published Lithuanian-language religious literature.[31] Jesuits also founded many colleges in other cities.[20] The Jesuits head the Vilnius University until 1773.[31] After the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, the Commission of National Education took over the management of Vilnius University and higher schools.[23]

The first churches appeared in Lithuania before the introduction of Christianity – they were built by merchants and craftsmen from other countries who lived here. After the baptism in 1387 the number of churches in Lithuania began to grow notably. In the middle of the twentieth century there were as many as 885 Catholic churches and chapels in Lithuania.[citation needed]

The first church in Lithuania, supposedly, was built by the Grand Duke Mindaugas in the thirteenth century. It was Vilnius Cathedral, which in its long history has been repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt. The oldest surviving stone church is St. Nicholas, built in the 14th – 15th centuries. It stands in Vilnius and visitors admire its Gothic and Romanesque features. St. Anne's Church is a masterpiece of late Gothic. The Chapel of the Gate of Dawn storing the icon of the Holy Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy in Vilnius has many features of late Renaissance and is one of the holy places in Lithuania most visited by pilgrims. Impressive architectural work of baroque is St. Peter and Paul Church in Vilnius. The oldest wooden church of Lithuania is in Palušė, Ignalina district.[48]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_Lithuania
Lithuania–United States relations,"Lithuania–United States relations are the bilateral foreign relations between Lithuania and the United States. Lithuania is one of the most pro-United States nations in the world, with 73% of Lithuanians viewing the U.S. positively in 2011.[1] According to the 2012 U.S. Global Leadership Report, 48% of Lithuanians approve of U.S. leadership, with 20% disapproving and 32% uncertain.[2]

The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on 28 July 1922. During World War II, Lithuania was at various times occupied by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The Soviet invasion and occupation forced the closure of the Legation to Lithuania on 5 September 1940. However, Lithuanian Diplomatic Service in the United States continued uninterrupted. American prisoners of war were among Allied POWs held by the Germans in the Stalag Luft VI POW camp in German-occupied Lithuania.[3] The United States never recognized the forced incorporation of Lithuania into the USSR and views the present government of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the interwar republic. In 2007, the United States and Lithuania celebrated 85 years of continuous diplomatic relations. Lithuania has enjoyed most-favored-nation treatment with the United States since December 1991. Since 1992, the United States has committed more than $100 million in Lithuania to economic and political transformation and to humanitarian needs. The United States and Lithuania signed an agreement on bilateral trade and intellectual property protection in 1994 and a bilateral investment treaty in 1997. In 1998, the United States signed a ""Charter of Partnership"" with Lithuania and the other Baltic countries establishing bilateral working groups focusing on improving regional security, defense, and economic issues.[4]

Today, over 650,000 individuals who identify as Lithuanian American live in the United States. Lithuanian immigration began before the United States even became a country, with individuals like Alexander Curtius settling in New Amsterdam (what would later become New York City) in 1659. Lithuania was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795, when foreign powers partitioned it and Lithuania was largely incorporated into the Russian Empire. Despite attempts by the Tsarist government in Moscow to prevent residents of the empire from emigrating, many Lithuanians came to the United States throughout the 19th and early 20th Centuries, settling primarily in the Northeast (especially Pennsylvania) and the Midwest. Lithuanian immigration tapered off with the passage of nativist legislation like the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 in Congress. Smaller waves of Lithuanian migration to the United States occurred at the end of World War II (thanks to the Displaced Persons Act) and when Lithuania regained its independence in 1990.

In November 2002, George W. Bush became the first US president to visit Lithuania.[5] It was a visit following the NATO invitation to join the alliance.

Anyone who would choose Lithuania as an enemy has also made an enemy of the United States of America.

In July 2023, Lithuania hosted 2023 Vilnius summit, receiving the US President Joe Biden along with around 40 other leaders. During the visit, President Biden gave a speech in Vilnius University.[7]

The U.S. Embassy in Lithuania is located in Vilnius (Akmenų g. 6).

Sejm court,"A sejm court (Polish: Sąd sejmowy) was a Polish judicial body that existed during the First Polish Republic. The sejm court was used as a means to ""judge crimes against the nation and the king.""[1]

According to historian Edward Opaliński, the Sejm court was an ""integral part of the Parliament"", with the court wielding authority over ""both appellant and trying gravest crimes."" However, Opaliński notes that the Sejm court was permitted to act ""only in the course of parliamentary debates; after they ended, its activity ceased.""[2]

The court sat in cases of impeachment – in the words of the May 3 Constitution of 1791 (article VIII: the judicial authority) – of government ""ministers [...] charged with breach of law by a deputation designated to examine their deeds [...]."" The composition and functioning of sejm courts were spelled out in an act of the Sejm passed on May 13, 1791.[citation needed]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejm_court

Lithuanian press ban,"The Lithuanian press ban (Lithuanian: spaudos draudimas) was a ban on all Lithuanian language publications printed in the Latin alphabet in force from 1865 to 1904 within the Russian Empire, which controlled Lithuania proper at the time.[1] Lithuanian-language publications that used Cyrillic were allowed and even encouraged by seeking Russification of Lithuanians.[2][1]

The concept arose after the failed January Uprising of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 24 April 1904. The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities.[3]

Under the ban, it was illegal to print, import, distribute, or possess any publications in the Latin alphabet.[4] Tsarist authorities hoped that this measure, part of a larger Russification plan, would decrease Polish influence on Lithuanians and would return them to what were considered their ancient historical ties with Russia.[5] However, Lithuanians organized printing outside the Empire, largely in Lithuania Minor (East Prussia), and in the United States.

Knygnešiai (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal books and periodicals across the border. The number of such publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius has described the ban as a test of the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote.[6]

The first book published in print in the Lithuanian language was Lutheran Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas in 1547. Other milestone publications included Daniel Klein's Grammar in 1653, a publication of the Bible in 1735, and the first work of imaginative literature, Kristijonas Donelaitis' Metai (The Seasons), in 1818.  During the years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted from 1569 to 1781, the Polish language gained ground as the written lingua franca of greater Lithuania, although the Prussian areas of Lithuania Minor continued to issue publications in Lithuanian.[7]

At the beginning of the 19th century, use of the Lithuanian language was largely limited to Lithuanian rural areas, apart from its use in Prussia; it was, however, retained by some members of the minor nobility, especially in the Samogitian region. Several factors contributed to its subsequent revival: the language drew attention from scholars of the emerging science of comparative linguistics; after the abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861, social mobility increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; and language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe.[8] Within the Catholic Church, the barriers that had earlier prevented commoners from entering the priesthood were eased. A closer relationship developed between the educated clergy, who were increasingly of ethnic Lithuanian stock, and their parishioners, including a sympathy with their wish to use the Lithuanian language.[9] The emerging national movement sought to distance itself from both Polish and Russian influences, and the use of the Lithuanian language was seen as an important aspect of this movement.[10]

According to the bibliographer Vaclovas Biržiška, between 1800 and 1864, when the press ban was enacted, 926 book titles were published in the Lithuanian language using its Latin alphabet.[11] The orthography of the language was not standardized; this problem was used by the Russian authorities as a rationale for the change to Cyrillic.[12]

After the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century, significant portions of Lithuania and Poland were incorporated into the Russian Empire. The uprising of 1863, seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth, convinced many Russian politicians that Polish cultural and political influence was the main obstacle hindering the Russification of Lithuania. They believed that if the Lithuanian peasantry were distanced from the Polonized nobility and the Catholic Church, Lithuanians would naturally come under Russian cultural influence, as they had allegedly been during previous eras.[13] The Russian politician Nikolai Miliutin wrote that ""Russian letters will finish that which was begun with the Russian sword.""[14]

On 13 May 1863, Tsar Alexander II of Russia appointed Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov as the governor general of the Vilna Governorate.[15] His duties included both suppression of the uprising, and implementation of the Russification policy. Because the situation was perceived as critical, Muravyov was temporarily granted extremely wide powers.[16] Muravyov and Ivan Petrovich Kornilov, the newly appointed director of the Vilnius educational district, prepared a radical long-term Russification program that became known as the Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings (Lithuanian: Rusų pradų atkūrimo programa). Its stated goals were to:[17]

On 22 May 1864, Tsar Alexander II approved this program.[15] A few days later Muravyov issued an administrative order that forbade printing Lithuanian language textbooks written in the Latin alphabet. This order was developed into a comprehensive ban on 6 September 1865, by Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman, Muravyov's successor.[13] Kaufman issued an order to six neighboring governorates declaring a full ban on all publications and demanding that censorship committees enforce it without hesitation. A week later the order was extended to the entire Empire by Pyotr Valuev, Minister of the Interior. In 1866, the ban was further extended to include all academic books.[16]

Despite its strict and widespread enforcement, none of the ban's supporting measures were ever actually codified into law. The ban was enforced based solely on administrative orders and the tsar's approval.[16] When the special temporary powers of the governor general were revoked in 1871, these administrative orders lost any legal value. From that point on the ban had no legal basis, but it was still strictly enforced.[16]

At first the Russian authorities encouraged and sponsored the publication of Lithuanian-language works in the Cyrillic alphabet. The idea of replacing the Latin alphabet with Cyrillic was first elaborated by the well-known Pan-Slavist Alexander Hilferding in his 1863 book Lithuania and Samogitia.[13]

The first experiments with the conversion of Lithuanian writings into Cyrillic were conducted by a Lithuanian linguist, Jonas Juška. He showed some samples of adapted texts to both Muravyov and Kornilov in February 1864.[13] However, Juška discontinued his work and Kornilov formed a committee to work on publishing Lithuanian books in Cyrillic. The committee had four members: the Polish librarian Stanisław Mikucki from Warsaw, Russian Jonas Kerčinskis, a Lithuanian Catholic priest who had converted to Eastern Orthodoxy, Antanas Petkevičius, and the well-known Lithuanian educator and publisher Laurynas Ivinskis.[16] Ivinskis soon withdrew from the committee. The first such  book was a primer intended for use in the new Russian schools that were replacing the Lithuanian parish schools. It appeared during the summer of 1864. The committee also published a prayer book, a calendar, and other religious literature.

About 55 Lithuanian-Cyrillic titles were published during the 40 years of the ban; about half of these were published during its first decade.[16] Seeing that the Lithuanian people were unwilling to accept these books, even when they were offered for free, the Russian government shifted its attention to eliminating the illegal publications.[citation needed]

The Russian Ministry of Education issued a report in May 1898 recommending that the press ban be repealed. The report stated that the ban had produced adverse and unforeseen results, including the development of Lithuanian nationalism. Other Russian officials had opined that the interests of the Russian state would be better served by the presence of a legal Lithuanian press that could be censored.[3]

During the years of the ban, 3,047 people (829 smugglers, 859 distributors, and 1,359 persons possessing banned books) were arrested in connection with the ban.[5]

Anti-Russian sentiment and distrust of the tsarist authorities had arisen after the 1863 revolt. The ban was also perceived as a threat to the Catholic Church; the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Cyrillic alphabet, and loyalty to the Latin alphabet was also a symbolic loyalty to Catholicism.[16] Attempts were made to circumvent the ban by using Gothic script. However, that was also banned in 1872. A number of problems arose with the various Lithuanian-Cyrillic orthographies, which were all criticized as ill-adapted to the Lithuanian language. Within Russia, the ban was opposed by scholarly, liberal, and pro-democratic groups, which served to mitigate the punishments.[4]

The organized resistance to the ban, both legal and illegal, was largely initiated by bishop Motiejus Valančius, who petitioned the government to exempt prayer books from the ban. He then moved towards sponsoring the illegal flow of books from outside Lithuania. The period from Valančius's death in 1875 to 1883 saw the establishment of the Lithuanian-language newspaper Auszra (The Dawn), and the resistance at this time is associated with bishop Antanas Baranauskas. The resistance intensified towards the end of the 19th century, after another major newspaper, Varpas (The Bell), edited by Vincas Kudirka, was established in 1889. Between 1891 and 1893, 31,718 publications were confiscated and destroyed; between 1900 and 1902 this number increased to 56,182, reflecting their increased flow.[19]

The period from 1890 to 1904 saw the publication of about 2,500 book titles in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet.  The majority of these were published in Tilsit, a city in East Prussia, although some publications reached Lithuania from the United States. A largely standardized written version of the language was achieved by the turn of the twentieth century, based on historical and Aukštaitijan (highland) usages;[20] the letters č and š were taken from Czech orthography.[21] The widely accepted Lithuanian Grammar, by Jonas Jablonskis, appeared in 1901.[21]

A number of challenges to the ban's legal basis were made, and the use of this venue intensified at the end of the 19th century, along with an increasing number of letters, petitions, and protests from Lithuanians. In 1902 and 1903, the Russian Supreme Court reversed two press ban convictions that had been brought against Antanas Macijauskas and Povilas Višinskis.[22] The court's decisions stated that the original executive decree creating the ban was illegal. The outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904 contributed to the Russian government's perception that its minorities needed to be accommodated.[3] The ban was officially lifted on 24 April 1904.[23]

Public and private education in Lithuanian was adversely affected by the press ban. The level of pent-up demand for schooling in the 19th century is illustrated by the increase in literacy in the Rietavas area; between 1853 and 1863, just before the ban, the number of literate persons rose from 11,296 to 24,330.[4] The subsequent ban is thought to have contributed to illiteracy in 19th-century Lithuania.[24]

In the wake of the ruling, parish schools were closed. A shortage of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated with the policy of Russification; students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also resulted in sanctions.[4]

A census of the Kovno Governorate in 1897 showed that a higher proportion of older people than younger had received formal education: of persons age 30 to 39, 61.87% had experienced some level of formal education, compared to only 54.68% of persons aged 10 to 19.[4]

After the ban was lifted, printing presses and their supporting social and cultural infrastructure needed to be established. The first issue of a Lithuanian newspaper after the ban, Vilniaus žinios, appeared on 23 December 1904; the Great Seimas of Vilnius, which took place in November 1905, was now able to issue its announcements and publications in Lithuanian.

The publishing houses of Martynas Kukta, Saliamonas Banaitis, and the Society of Saint Casimir in Kaunas were responsible for many of the publications issued between the end of the ban in 1904 and the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1918. The businessman Petras Vileišis installed a printing press at his palace, commissioned in 1904. During this period 4,734 Lithuanian-language titles in the Latin alphabet were published in Lithuania and abroad. After Lithuanian independence was established, the rate of publication increased steadily; 16,721 book titles were printed from 1918 to 1939. Between 1925 and 1939, about 800 to 900 book titles were printed annually.[11]

A standard Lithuanian orthography and grammar were established during the ban, despite the fact that the co-ordination of this process, involving competing dialects, was forced to take place in several countries. The ban is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement, rather than discouraging it.[25] In 2004, the 100th anniversary of the ban's end was noted in UNESCO's events calendar, and the Lithuanian Seimas declared the ""Year of the Lithuanian Language and Book.""[26]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_press_ban

Mongol invasions of Lithuania,"The Mongol invasions of Lithuania was an event where the Mongol armies invaded the territories of the Kingdom of Lithuania and later, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, on several occasions in late 13th and early 14th century. The event is not very well documented. In due course, however, the Lithuanians were able to take control of a number of former Mongol territories, expand their influence in Eastern Europe, and contribute to the liberation of neighbouring peoples.[1]

The Lithuanians first made contact with the Mongols around 1237–1240, though for the next decade or two the Mongols did not consider Lithuanian-held territories a priority.[2]

In 1258–59, a joint Tatar-Rus'ian army led by Burundai launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Lithuania ruled by Mindaugas, devastating the country.[3][4] It was in response to Lithuanian incursions on Mongol-held territories in 1255 and 1258.[5] Although the young state has managed to withstand this incursion, it likely played a crucial role in determining its further religious orientation as Mindaugas was starting to lose his allies and pro-pagan sentiments reemerged. The threat posed by the Mongols and lack of any meaningful support from the Roman Curia, led to Treniota and his accomplices forcing Mindaugas to renounce his union with the Livonian Order for an alliance with Alexandr Nevsky, who was a docile subject of the Tatars. The temporary shifting of the allegiance of its successor, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, toward the Mongols, or at least, away from the Christian Europe, was also a short-term victory for the Mongols.[2]

After raiding Lithuania and the Yotvingians,[4] the next year, two tumens (20,000 men), under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland (in what is known as the Second Mongol invasion of Poland).[6]

In the immediate aftermath of this invasion, Lithuania might have become a tributary and ally to the Horde for several years or decades.[2][7][8] A similar fate was likely met by the Lithuanian neighbours, the Yotvingians. Some Lithuanian or Yotvingian warriors likely participated in the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1259, though there are no historical documents to clarify whether they did so with their leaders' permission, or as free mercenaries, or as forced troops. According to Krakowski, the term 'Prussian' mentioned in the historical accounts could also cover some Yotvingian and Lithuanian units. Gregorz Błaszczyk believes that such a position belongs to the sphere of hypotheses.[2]

Nonetheless, the invasion did not have major or lasting consequences for Lithuania,[3] particularly as it was not directly incorporated into the Mongol Empire, nor subject to Mongol darughachi administration.[2]

Mongols raided Lithuania again in 1275,[9] 1279,[10] and 1325.[11]

Overall, the Mongols did not make any major effort to conquer Lithuania.[3] In time, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a rival to the Golden Horde, temporarily taking over some of the former Kievan Rus' territories controlled by the Mongols as the Horde became weakened in the 13th and 14th centuries, though it lacked manpower to threaten Mongol territories outside of northeastern Europe.[11][12]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Lithuania

Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye,"The Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (Yiddish: פֿאַראײניקטע פּאַרטיזאַנער אָרגאַניזאַציע‎; ""United Partisan Organization""; Lithuanian: Jungtinė Partizanų Organizacija; referred to as FPO by its Yiddish initials) was a Jewish resistance organization based in the Vilna Ghetto in Lithuania that organized armed resistance against the Nazis during World War II.[1][better source needed] The clandestine organisation was established by communist and Zionist partisans. Their leaders were writer Abba Kovner, Josef Glazman and Yitzhak Wittenberg.

The FPO was formed on January 21, 1942, in the Vilna Ghetto. It took on the motto: ""We will not allow them to take us like sheep to the slaughter."" This was the first Jewish resistance organization established in the ghettos of Nazi-occupied Europe in World War II,[2] followed by Łachwa underground in August 1942.[3] Unlike in other ghettos – where the underground resistance was coordinated to some extent with the officials of the local Jewish establishment – Vilna's Jacob Gens, head of the ghetto, cooperated with German officials in stopping armed resistance. The FPO brought together Socialist Zionists, right-wing Revisionist Zionists, Communists/Marxists and Bundists. It was headed by Yitzhak Wittenberg, Josef Glazman, and Abba Kovner.[4]

The goals of the FPO were to establish self-defense in the ghetto, to sabotage German industrial and military activities and to join the partisan and Red Army’s fight against the Nazis.[5] Abe (Abba) Kovner, the movement's leader, and 17 members of the local Zionist group Hashomer Hatzair, stationed at a Polish Catholic convent for an order of Dominican Sisters, sheltered from the Nazis by Mother Superior Anna Borkowska (Sister Bertranda),[6] who was the first to supply hand grenades and other weapons to the Vilnius ghetto underground.[7]

The FPO did not succeed in its mission. In early 1943, the Germans caught a resistance member in the forest. The Judenrat, one of the widely used administrative agencies imposed by Nazi Germany, in response to German threats, gave Wittenberg over to the Gestapo. The Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye organized an uprising. The FPO was able to rescue Wittenberg through an armed struggle and then set up a small militia.[8] The Judenrat did not tolerate this, because the Nazis gave them an ultimatum to end the resistance or face extermination. The Judenrat knew that Jews were smuggling weapons into the ghetto and when a Jew was arrested for buying a revolver, they finally gave the FPO an order to withdraw.[citation needed] The Judenrat turned the people against the resistance members by making them seem like selfish enemies who were provoking the Nazis.[citation needed] Jacob Gens emphasized the people's responsibility for one another, saying that resistance was sacrificing the good of the community.[citation needed] As the Germans demanded that Wittenberg should be handed over to them, the Judenrat and Gens convinced the majority of the inhabitants of the ghetto to acquiesce to that request, arguing that tens of thousands should not be sacrificed for the sake of one man. As people assembled insisting that Wittenberg should be given to the Germans, he agreed to surrender to the Gestapo and was found dead in his cell on the next morning, having committed suicide according to most accounts. Discouraged by the attitude of the population of the ghetto, the FPO decided not to resist there and began to gradually relocate to the forests.[9][10]

When the Nazis came to liquidate the ghetto in 1943, the members of the FPO again congregated. Gens took control of the liquidation so as to rid the ghetto of the Germans, but helped fill the quota of Jews with those who would fight but were not necessarily part of the resistance. The FPO fled to the forest, where most were able to reach Soviet partisan units. FPO members participated in the Vilnius Offensive led by the Soviet army in July 1944.[1]

Fania Brantsovsky, 22 May 1922 - 22 September 2024 (aged 102), was the last known surviving member of the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye. Remaining in Lithuania after the war, she served as the Vilnius Yiddish Institute's librarian, and a beloved teacher there, lifelong advocate for the memory and legacy of the culture and heritage of the once illustrious Jewish Lithuanian community.[11]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fareynikte_Partizaner_Organizatsye

Postage stamps and postal history of Lithuania,"This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of Lithuania.

The postal history of Lithuania started around the 10th or 12th century or even earlier, with a pre-Christian messaging system known as krivūlė. The first mail service was introduced in 1562, connecting Vilnius with Kraków, and Venice.

Lithuania was under the rule of the Russian Empire until the 20th century. After the outbreak of  World War I, Germany occupied Lithuania and Courland in 1915. The civil administration of the Oberbefehlhaber Ost was created in the German-occupied territory of the Russian Empire. Stamps of Germany overprinted ""Postgebiet Ob. Ost"" were issued in 1916.

The Act of Independence of Lithuania was adopted on 16 February 1918, proclaiming Lithuania as an independent republic. The first Lithuanian postage stamps (""Baltukai"" issue) were issued in Vilnius in 1918. A total of 768 stamps of different designs were issued by the Republic of Lithuania between 1918 and 1940, with more than 2,000 variations due to errors, misprints or perforations. The first airmail stamps were issued in 1921.[1]

After the 1940 occupation by the Soviet Union, Lithuanian postage stamps were overprinted ""LTSR"" (Lietuvos Tarybų Socialistinė Respublika, Lithuanian for Lithuanian Socialist Soviet Republic). These were then replaced by Soviet stamps.

On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Following the German occupation, Soviet stamps were overprinted ""Nepriklausoma Lietuva 1941-VI-23"" (Independent Lithuania 1941-VI-23) in 1941. Lithuania became part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland, the German occupation administration. Stamps were issued for use in the Reichskommissariat Ostland by overprinting ""Ostland"" on stamps of Germany.

After the war, the Soviet Union reestablished occupation over Lithuania and Soviet stamps came into use again.

After Lithuania declared the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, Lithuania again issued own stamps. Lithuania's independence was recognized by the Soviet Union on September 6, 1991.

There were also several local issues, including the Raseiniai local issue (1919), Telšiai Postmaster's provisional issue (1920), Grodno issue (1919), and others.

In the course of the Polish–Soviet War, pro-Polish separatists proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Central Lithuania (Litwa Środkowa) centered around Vilnius in October 1920. Central Lithuania issued stamps from 1920 until annexation by Poland in 1922.[2]

In 1920, according to the Treaty of Versailles, the German area north of the Memel river was given the status of Territoire de Memel under the administration of the Council of Ambassadors, and French troops were sent for protection.

On 9 January 1923, Lithuania occupied the territory during the Klaipėda Revolt and the territory was annexed by Lithuania.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamps_and_postal_history_of_Lithuania

Social Democratic Party of Lithuania,"The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos socialdemokratų partija, abbr. LSDP) is a centre-left[2] and social democratic[3] political party in Lithuania.[4] Founded as an underground Marxist organisation in 1896, it is the oldest extant party in Lithuania. During the time of the Soviet Union, the party went into exile, emerging once again after the end of communist rule in 1989.

The party led a government in the unicameral Seimas, Lithuania's parliament from 2001 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2016. It has been the ruling party of Lithuania since 2024. The party is a member of the Party of European Socialists (PES), Progressive Alliance,[5] and Socialist International.[6]

Initial discussions about forming a Marxist political party in Lithuania began early in 1895, with a number of informal gatherings bringing together social democrats of various stripes resulting in a preparatory conference in the summer of that year.[7] Differences in objectives became clear between ethnic Jews and ethnic Lithuanians and Poles, with the former seeing themselves essentially as Russian Marxists while the latter two groups harboured both revolutionary and national aspirations.[8] Moreover, the ethnic Poles and Lithuanians saw themselves divided over the question of alliance with non-Marxist liberals. As a result, not one but three Marxist political organisations would emerge in Lithuania between 1895 and 1897.[9]

The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP) was founded on 1 May (19 April O.S.) 1896 at a secret congress held in an apartment in Vilnius.[10] Among the 13 delegates were Andrius Domaševičius and Alfonsas Moravskis—a pair of intellectuals regarded as the central organisers of the new political entity—and the future President of Lithuania, Kazys Grinius, as well as a number of worker activists.[11] Also in attendance as a representative of the radical youth movement was an 18-year-old ethnic Pole named Felix Dzerzhinsky, later the head of the Soviet secret police.[10] As Lithuania was then part of the Russian Empire, the LSDP was inevitably an illegal organisation, meeting in secret and seeking to bring about the revolutionary overthrow of the Tsarist regime.

The LSDP was a dual language organisation, publishing its illegal newspapers both in Lithuanian and Polish.[12] Newspapers were published abroad, printed in East Prussia (or sometimes Switzerland or France) and smuggled across the border.[13] Technical assistance was occasionally provided by the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania party, headed by Julian Marchlewski.[14]

This smuggling of Lithuanian newspapers had historical antecedents. Following the Polish and Lithuanian Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist regime had banned publication of all newspapers which used the Latin alphabet, a measure which amounted to a de facto ban of the entire Lithuanian press.[15] This proscription extended for the rest of the 19th Century; in 1898 of 18 newspapers appearing in Lithuanian, 11 were published by Lithuanians in emigration in America and the other 7 were published in East Prussia.[15]

The LSDP was very nearly obliterated at birth by the Okhrana, which over the course of 1897 to 1899 managed to arrest a number of the party's leading activists.[14] Approximately 280 socialist and trade union organisers were apprehended during this period, with subsequent trials leading to the Siberian exile of more than 40 people, including Domaševičius and Dzerzhinsky.[14] Other top leaders, including Moravskis, were forced to flee the country to avoid being swept up in the Okhrana's dragnet.[14] With the party leadership jailed or chased from the country, the LSDP very nearly ceased to exist as the 19th century drew to a close.[14]

From 1900 to 1902, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania began to tentatively rise from the ashes behind a new crop of young revolutionaries.[14] Chief among these were a pair of Lithuanian students in Vilnius, Vladas Sirutavičius and Steponas Kairys.[16]

It was the first Lithuanian political party and one of the major parties who initiated the assembly called Great Seimas of Vilnius in 1905. The party was one of the major political powers during the Lithuanian independence period between 1918 and 1940. Following the election of 1926, the party formed a left-wing coalition government with Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union. This government was dismissed after the 1926 Lithuanian coup d'état. The authoritarian regime of Antanas Smetona banned all political parties in 1936.

During the Soviet occupation era, no democratically constituted political parties existed within Lithuania. Therefore, between 1945 and the 1989 restoration of independence, the party was assembled and worked covertly in exile.[citation needed]

In 1989, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania was restored. Kazimieras Antanavičius was elected to be party's leader. The party had 9 seats in the Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas and was not successful in substantially increasing the number in the following elections, with 8 seats won in 1992 and 12 in 1996.

In 1999, the party's congress elected a new leader, Vytenis Andriukaitis and merger negotiations with the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP)–the bulk of the former Communist Party of Lithuania (which had broken away from Moscow in 1989) began. Members of the party opposing the merger left to establish ""Social democracy 2000"" (later renamed ""Social Democratic Union of Lithuania""). The SDPL-LDDP coalition won 51 of the 141 seats in the elections in 2000 (with 19 going to the Social Democrats). However, despite success in the elections, the coalition parties had to settle for a place in the opposition until 2001, when the collapse of the ruling coalition between Liberals and New Union allowed ex-President Algirdas Brazauskas to form a government with New Union.

In 2001, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania merged. The merged party kept the Social Democratic name, but was dominated by former Democratic Labour Party members (ex-Communists). After the merger, Algirdas Brazauskas was elected leader of the Social Democratic Party.

By the beginning of 2004, negotiations between the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and various other parties to form electoral coalition.[17] They managed to form electoral coalition called ""Working for Lithuania"" with their coalition partners, New Union.[18] At the 2004 legislative elections, the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania won 20 of the 141 seats in the Seimas (other 11 seats were won by the New Union), but managed to stay at the helm of successive coalition governments, including the minority government between 2006 and 2008. During the minority government, party's parliamentary group became the largest one in parliament, mainly due to defections from the Labour Party and the New Union (Social Liberals).

Brazauskas resigned as the chairman of the party on 19 May 2007 and was replaced by Gediminas Kirkilas.

At the 2008 elections, the party won 11.73% of the national vote and 25 seats in the Seimas, five more than in the previous elections. However, its coalition partners, the Labour Party, the New Union (Social Liberals) and the Lithuanian Peasants Popular Union, fared poorly and the party ended up in opposition to the Homeland Union-led government.

On 7 March 2009, the party's congress elected a new leader, Algirdas Butkevičius. He was the party's candidate at the 2009 Lithuanian presidential election, coming in second place with 11.83% of the vote.

At the 2012 parliamentary elections, the party took 38 seats and became the largest party in Parliament (although it lost in popular vote). Butkevičius became the prime minister, forming a coalition government with the Labour Party, Order and Justice and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance.[19] At the 2016 parliamentary elections, the party took 21 seats and formed a coalition with Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.

In 2017, the Social Democratic Party withdraw from coalition. In 2018, some party members left and formed the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania. After this split, the party lost a lot of support, but in 2019 it partly recovered.

At the 2020 parliamentary elections, the party achieved worse results than expected. Due to this, Gintautas Paluckas received criticism from party's board and resigned in 2021. After a leadership election, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (between 2002 and 2006 she was New Union (Social Liberals) member) was elected as the new leader. After election of Blinkevičiūtė, the party's support nearly doubled thanks to her personal popularity.[20]

In the 2024 parliamentary elections, the party achieved a ""historic victory"",[21] finishing in first place with 19.32% of the popular vote and 52 out of 141 seats.[22] While party chair Vilija Blinkevičiūtė had expressed her willingness to serve as prime minister during the campaign, she declined the role after the election, leading instead to the nomination of deputy chair Gintautas Paluckas. This unexpected change in leadership was criticized by the LSDP's potential coalition partners.[23]

After the election, further controversy arose when the Social Democrats invited the newly created populist party Dawn of Nemunas to join the ruling coalition, along with the Union of Democrats ""For Lithuania"". The founder of Dawn of Nemunas, Remigijus Žemaitaitis, is known for making antisemitic statements,[24] and his party's inclusion sparked backlash from Lithuanian civil society groups,[25] as well as from lawmakers and ambassadors abroad, including US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Ben Cardin,[26] German MPs Roderich Kiesewetter and Michael Roth,[27] Polish senator Michał Kamiński,[28] and the Israeli embassy.[29] Roth, the chair of the Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee, urged the LSDP to reconsider their choice and claimed that it would threaten LSDP's membership in the Party of European Socialists.[27] However, no official PES condemnation of the coalition was issued, and the European party congratulated the Social Democrats with the formation of the Paluckas Cabinet on December 12.[30]

LSDP is generally described as a centre-left party.[20][31][32] Historically, the party was criticized for lacking commitment to social democracy. According to political scientist Ainė Ramonaitė [lt], ""before their split, the Social Democrats never managed to be a left-wing party. Although they said they were, their policies were right-wing, even the vocabulary was closer to the right.""[33] During the Eleventh Seimas from 2012 to 2016, when the party played a leading role in the Butkevičius Cabinet, it was criticized by left-wing intellectuals such as Andrius Bielskis and Arkadijus Vinokuras for lacking allegiance to left-wing ideas and for its neoliberal policies, such as reforms to the Labour Code in 2016 which strengthened the position of employers in workplace relations.[34]

In 2017, after Gintautas Paluckas was elected as the party's chairman, LSDP declared a renewal of its ideology and values, reforming closer to a Western social democratic party.[35] It introduced a new program, in which it affirmed commitment to progressive taxation, encouragement of worker cooperatives, women's rights and LGBT rights, and support for NATO and the European Union, while at the same time opposing European austerity policies.[36] Several of the party's former leaders and members of the Seimas left the party in 2017 and 2018, including two former Prime Ministers, Gediminas Kirkilas and Algirdas Butkevičius. Most of them then established the Social Democratic Labour Party, later renamed to the Lithuanian Regions Party.[37] However, this renewal was also criticized as incomplete and straddling the fence between progressiveness and the party's previous non-ideological populism.[38]

After Paluckas' resignation, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė was elected as LSDP's new chairman. The party's program was retained, and conservative former party members such as Artūras Skardžius were not accepted back into the party.[39] However, the party has since focused most on criticism of the Homeland Union and progressive economic proposals over social justice and social reforms. 5 of 13 of the party's members of the Seimas voted against a proposed same-sex partnership law in 2021, even though the party's program was in favor of same-sex partnerships.[40] The Left Alliance was founded in 2022 in response to the Social Democrats' alleged betrayal of left-wing values.[41]

The party supports lowering voting age to 16 in local elections.[42]

In early 1990s, the party had between 3 and 5 per cent support nationally. It got most support from areas with light industry (e. g. Marijampolė, Vilkaviškis, Miklusėnai).[43][44] By the end of decade, LSDP increased their support in Radviliškis District Municipality (probably, at expense of Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP)).[45]

After merger of these two parties, LSDP gained support from most supporters of LDDP. In early 2010s, the party lost support due to deindustrialisation, rise of public election committees and Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (e. g. in Kaunas, by 2011, got over 12 per cent of votes; however, in 2019, the party received just over 3 per cent of the votes).[46][47]

Social Democratic Party of Lithuania won 17 seats in the 2016 election, but the party split in October 2017. 9 members of the party were subsequently removed from the party.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Lithuania
Mongol invasions of Lithuania,"The Mongol invasions of Lithuania was an event where the Mongol armies invaded the territories of the Kingdom of Lithuania and later, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, on several occasions in late 13th and early 14th century. The event is not very well documented. In due course, however, the Lithuanians were able to take control of a number of former Mongol territories, expand their influence in Eastern Europe, and contribute to the liberation of neighbouring peoples.[1]

The Lithuanians first made contact with the Mongols around 1237–1240, though for the next decade or two the Mongols did not consider Lithuanian-held territories a priority.[2]

In 1258–59, a joint Tatar-Rus'ian army led by Burundai launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Lithuania ruled by Mindaugas, devastating the country.[3][4] It was in response to Lithuanian incursions on Mongol-held territories in 1255 and 1258.[5] Although the young state has managed to withstand this incursion, it likely played a crucial role in determining its further religious orientation as Mindaugas was starting to lose his allies and pro-pagan sentiments reemerged. The threat posed by the Mongols and lack of any meaningful support from the Roman Curia, led to Treniota and his accomplices forcing Mindaugas to renounce his union with the Livonian Order for an alliance with Alexandr Nevsky, who was a docile subject of the Tatars. The temporary shifting of the allegiance of its successor, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, toward the Mongols, or at least, away from the Christian Europe, was also a short-term victory for the Mongols.[2]

After raiding Lithuania and the Yotvingians,[4] the next year, two tumens (20,000 men), under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland (in what is known as the Second Mongol invasion of Poland).[6]

In the immediate aftermath of this invasion, Lithuania might have become a tributary and ally to the Horde for several years or decades.[2][7][8] A similar fate was likely met by the Lithuanian neighbours, the Yotvingians. Some Lithuanian or Yotvingian warriors likely participated in the Mongol invasion of Poland in 1259, though there are no historical documents to clarify whether they did so with their leaders' permission, or as free mercenaries, or as forced troops. According to Krakowski, the term 'Prussian' mentioned in the historical accounts could also cover some Yotvingian and Lithuanian units. Gregorz Błaszczyk believes that such a position belongs to the sphere of hypotheses.[2]

Nonetheless, the invasion did not have major or lasting consequences for Lithuania,[3] particularly as it was not directly incorporated into the Mongol Empire, nor subject to Mongol darughachi administration.[2]

Mongols raided Lithuania again in 1275,[9] 1279,[10] and 1325.[11]

Overall, the Mongols did not make any major effort to conquer Lithuania.[3] In time, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a rival to the Golden Horde, temporarily taking over some of the former Kievan Rus' territories controlled by the Mongols as the Horde became weakened in the 13th and 14th centuries, though it lacked manpower to threaten Mongol territories outside of northeastern Europe.[11][12]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_of_Lithuania
2021 Lithuanian census,"The 2021 Lithuania Census was the first census in Lithuania carried out electronically. Basing on the recommendations of the United Nations and the July 9, 2008 European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No. 763/2008 on population and housing censuses, the censuses are carried out the same year every 10 years in all member states of the European Union. In Lithuania the census accounting day was January 1, 2021.[1]

Within the framework of the census, in the following months a statistical study was carried out of the population's nationality, native language and professed faith. During the first stage in January-February the survey was carried out online for 56 thousand of residents, at the second stage in April-June the surveyors surveyed 115 thousand of residents who didn't take part in the online survey from 40 thousand households.[2]

On January 1, 2021, 2,810,761 persons permanently lived in Lithuania, a decline from  3,483,972 recorded during the previous Lithuanian census of 2001. The decline was attributed to negative international migration of 119 thousand (51%) and negative population change of 114 thousand (49%).[2]

The census was carried out in 103 urban locations (1,916,751 residents) and 16,039 rural locations (894,010 residents).[4]

According to the statistical study, 85.33% of the country's population speak Lithuanian as their native language, 6.8% are native speakers of Russian and 5.1% of Polish. As of 2021[update], 60.6% of residents speak Russian as a foreign language, 31.1% – English, 10.5% – Lithuanian, 8% – German, 7.9% – Polish, 1.9% – French, 2.6% – various others.[5]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Lithuanian_census
Politics of Lithuania,"Politics of Lithuania takes place in a framework of a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic,[1][2][3][4] whereby the president of Lithuania is the head of state and the prime minister of Lithuania is the head of government, and of a multi-party system.

Executive power is exercised by the president and the Government, which is headed by the prime minister. Legislative power is vested in both the Government and the unicameral Seimas (Lithuanian Parliament). Judicial power is vested in judges appointed by the president of Lithuania and is independent of executive and legislature power. The judiciary consists of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Court of Appeal as well as the separate administrative courts. The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania established these powers upon its approval on 25 October 1992. Being a multi-party system, the government of Lithuania is not dominated by any single political party, rather it consists of numerous parties that must work with each other to form coalition governments. The Economist Intelligence Unit rated Lithuania a ""flawed democracy"" in 2022.[5][needs update]

Since Lithuania restored independence on 11 March 1990, it has kept democratic traditions. Drawing from the interwar experiences, politicians made many different proposals that ranged from strong parliamentarism to a presidential republic with checks and balances similar to the United States. Through compromise, a semi-presidential system was settled.[1] In a referendum on 25 October 1992, the first general vote of the people since their declared independence, 56.75% of the total number of voters supported the new constitution.[6]

All major political parties declared their support for Lithuania's membership in NATO and the European Union (EU). Lithuania joined NATO on 29 March 2004.[7] Lithuania joined the EU on 1 May 2004 and Schengen Area on 21 December 2007 and Eurozone on 1 January 2015.[8]

Since 1991, Lithuanian voters have shifted from right to left and back again, swinging between the Conservatives, led by Vytautas Landsbergis, and the (formerly Communist) Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania, led by president Algirdas Brazauskas. During this period, the prime minister was Gediminas Vagnorius.

Valdas Adamkus was the president since 1998. His proposed prime minister was Rolandas Paksas, whose government got off to a rocky start and collapsed within seven months. The alternation between left and right was broken in the October 2000 elections when the Liberal Union and New Union parties won the most votes and were able to form a centrist ruling coalition with minor partners. President Adamkus played a key role in bringing the new centrist parties together. Artūras Paulauskas, the leader of the centre-left New Union (also known as the social-liberal party), became the Chairman of the Seimas. In July 2001, the centre-left New Union party forged an alliance with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and formed a new cabinet under former president Algirdas Brazauskas. On 11 April 2006, Artūras Paulauskas was removed from his position and Viktoras Muntianas was elected Chairman of the Seimas.[9]

The cabinet of Algirdas Brazauskas resigned on 31 May 2006, as President Valdas Adamkus expressed no confidence in two of the Ministers, formerly party colleagues of Brazauskas, over ethical principles. Brazauskas decided not to remain in office as acting prime minister, and announced that he was finally retiring from politics.[10] Even so, he led the ruling Social Democratic Party of Lithuania for one more year, until 19 May 2007, when he passed the reins to Gediminas Kirkilas. On 27 November 2008, Andrius Kubilius of conservative Homeland Union was appointed as a prime minister.[11] In December 2012 Andrius Kubilius was succeeded by Algirdas Butkevičius after his Social Democratic Party became the biggest party in parliamentary elections.[12]

In 2016, The Peasant and Green's Union (LGPU) won parliamentary elections. It secured 54 seats in the 141-member parliament (Seimas), making a previously small centrist agrarian party the biggest in parliament. The conservative Homeland Union won 30 seats. The ruling Social Democrats, led by Lithuania's Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevciu, lost heavily and secured just 17 seats.[13] On 22 November 2016, Saulius Skvernelis of the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union, became new prime minister.[14]

In October 2020, conservative opposition Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) won parliamentary elections with 50 seats. Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis' Union of Farmers and Greens came a distant second with just 32 seats.[15] In November 2020, Ingrida Šimonytė became new prime minister, after forming a centre-right coalition government of her TS-LKD and two liberal parties.[16]

Government in Lithuania is made up of three branches originally envisioned by enlightenment philosopher Baron de Montesquieu: executive, legislative, and judicial. Each branch is separate and is set up to do checks and balances on each other branch.

The executive branch of the Lithuanian government consists of a president, a prime minister, and the president's Council of Ministers. It is in charge of running the government.

The president of Lithuania is the head of state of the country, elected directly for a five-year term and can serve maximum of two terms consecutively. Presidential elections take place in a modified version of the two-round system. If half of voters participate, a candidate must win a majority of the total valid vote in order to win election in the first round. If fewer than half of voters participate, a candidate can win outright with a plurality and at least one third of the total vote. If the first round does not produce a president, a runoff is held between the top two finishers in the first round, with a plurality sufficient to win.

The president, with the approval of the Seimas, is first responsible of appointing the prime minister. Upon the prime minister's nomination, the president also appoints, under the recommendation of the prime minister, the Council of Ministers (13 ministries), as well as a number of other top civil servants and the judges for all courts. The president also serves as the commander-in-chief, oversees foreign and security policy, addresses political problems of foreign and domestic affairs, proclaims states of emergency, considers the laws adopted by the Seimas, and performs other duties specified in the Constitution.[17] Lithuanian presidents have somewhat greater power than their counterparts in Estonia and Latvia, but have more influence in foreign policy than domestic policy.[18]

Former president Rolandas Paksas, who had defeated Adamkus in 2003, was impeached in April 2004 for leaking classified information.[19]

Dalia Grybauskaitė, the first female president, served as the president of Lithuania since July 2009 until 2019, winning a reelection bid in 2014. Grybauskaitė succeeded Valdas Adamkus who had served a total of two non-consecutive terms.[20]

In 2019, Gitanas Nauseda won Lithuania's presidential runoff election after his opponent Ingrida Šimonytė conceded.[21]

The prime minister of Lithuania is the head of government of the country, appointed by the president and approved by the Seimas. The prime minister, within 15 days of being appointed, is responsible for choosing ministers for the president to approve to each of the 13 ministries. In general, the prime minister is in charge of the affairs of the country, maintains homeland security, carries out laws and resolutions of the Seimas and decrees of the president, maintains diplomatic relations with foreign countries and international organizations, and performs other duties specified in the Constitution.[17] In practice, the prime minister is mostly responsible for domestic policy, while the president mostly handles foreign policy.

Similar to the cabinet of other nations, the Council of Ministers consists of 13 ministers chosen by the prime minister and appointed by the president. Each minister is responsible for his or her own ministry of the Lithuanian government and must give reports on his or her ministry when directed to.[22] When the prime minister resigns or dies, the position is to be filled as soon as possible and the new leader will appoint a new government.

The parliament (Seimas) has 141 members that are elected for a 4-year term. About half of the members are elected in single-member districts (71), and the other half (70) are elected in the nationwide vote using proportional representation by party lists. A party must receive at least 5% of the national vote to be represented in the Seimas.

The judges of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania (Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucinis Teismas) for a single nine-year term are appointed by the Seimas from the candidates presented by the President (three judges), Chairman of Seimas (three judges) and the chairman of the Supreme Court (three judges).

Lithuania has a three-tier administrative division: the country is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys) that are further subdivided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular – savivaldybė, plural – savivaldybės) which consist of over 500 elderships (Lithuanian: singular – seniūnija, plural – seniūnijos).

The county governors (Lithuanian: apskrities viršininkas) institution and county administrations have been dissolved in 2010.[23]

Municipalities are the most important administrative unit. Some municipalities are historically called ""district municipalities"", and thus are often shortened to ""district""; others are called ""city municipalities"", sometimes shortened to ""city"". Each municipality has its own elected government. In the past, the election of municipality councils occurred once every three years, but it now takes place every four years. The council appoints elders to govern the elderships. Mayors are elected directly since 2015, being appointed by the council before that.[24]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Lithuania
Basketball in Lithuania,"Basketball is the most popular sport in Lithuania.[2][3][4] During public opinion polls in Lithuania, the Lithuanians regularly describe basketball as their priority interest sport (e.g. 43,8% in 2003, 53,4% in 2010).[5][6] A research in 2015 indicated that nearly 41% of all population in Lithuania watched the EuroBasket 2015 final between Lithuania and Spain and it became the most watched event of the 21st century in Lithuania.[7][8] The popularity of basketball among Lithuanians led to it being nicknamed as the ""second religion"" in Lithuania.[9][10][11][12]

Lithuanian-American basketball coaches and players in the 1930s helped the Lithuania men's national basketball team win the last EuroBasket tournaments prior to World War II, in 1937 and 1939, causing a massive impact in Lithuanian society and a basketball popularity spike. Since then, despite Lithuania's small size, with a population of just almost 2.9 million, the country's devotion to basketball has made them a traditional force of the sport in Europe.[1]

Following the country's occupation by the Soviet Union during the war, Lithuanian players frequently formed the core of the Soviet national team, and the Lithuanian people strongly supported local club BC Žalgiris, particularly against Russian squads. After the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1990, the national team was resurrected, with their first official tournament being the 1992 Olympics, where they won a bronze medal. The Lithuanians have since won another two bronzes at the Olympics, a bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, and five EuroBasket medals, including the country's third title at FIBA EuroBasket 2003 in Sweden.

At the professional club level, Žalgiris of Kaunas won the top-tier EuroLeague in 1999 and the second-tier FIBA Saporta Cup in 1998 and was also the FIBA Intercontinental Cup champion in 1986 under Soviet occupation. BC Lietuvos Rytas of Vilnius won two times the second-tier EuroCup, in 2005 and 2009.

While basketball started being played in Lithuania by women, the women's national team has not achieved the same success as the male one, despite a title at EuroBasket Women 1997.

In 2015, the Lithuania men's national basketball team (European vice-champions that year) was ranked third in the FIBA Men's World Ranking (at the time surpassed only by the Olympic champions United States and European champions Spain men's national basketball teams).[13] Moreover, the Lithuania men's national basketball team managed to defeat the United States men's national team three times in major international tournaments: twice in the FIBA World Championships/World Cups (1998, 2023) and once in the Olympic Games (2004).[14] As of 2023, a total of 18 Lithuanian basketball players were recognized as the Lithuanian Sportsman of the Year (the nomination was started since 1956).[15]

Basketball was introduced in Lithuania indirectly through the European variety of Netball, featuring a smaller ball and no boards, brought by the Germans. In 1919 Lithuanian women athletes started organizing, and in 1920-1921 they started playing the game in public.[16][2] The female pioneerism delayed basketball's widespread popularity until the 1930s as it kept being considered a woman's sport.[17][18] In the meantime, in 1922 Karolis Dineika released the book Krepšiasvydis vyrams (English: Basketball for men), and in 1926 pilot Steponas Darius, who would later be known for his transatlantic flight, published the first basketball rules in Lithuania.[19][20]

Despite the fact that women were the first basketball players in Lithuania, the first official game was played by men. It took place on 23 April 1922 when Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimo Sąjunga (English: Lithuanian Physical Education Union) played a game against Kaunas team, winning 8–6. That day is regarded as the beginning of basketball in Lithuania. The press at the time described the match by writing: ""The game was very interesting and left positive impression on the spectators. The observers were fascinated by the game so much that they felt living in a quite cultured country by watching our quick, joyful players. ... The audience heartily rejoiced at the gameplay of the excellent basketball players and applauded after shots and passes by Steponas Darius and Viktoras Dineika. ... Krepšiasvydis game, organized for the first time in Lithuania, gave beautiful hopes that in the future this game could lead our sportsmen to greater achievements"".[21] Two years later, the first Lithuanian men's basketball tournament in Lithuania was organized, featuring two teams from LFLS and one from Lietuvos Dviračių Sąjunga (English: Lithuanian Cycles Union), and a course for basketball referees was held. The first class included Elena Garbačiauskienė and Steponas Darius.[22]

From 1926 to 1933, basketball saw its popularity decrease and get overshadowed by football. Basketball was played only during the summer period because there was no suitable indoor arena, and the game was mostly played by representatives of other sports, who allocated little time to it. The number of games played decreased, and the national championship was not even contested between 1929 and 1932.[23] It started to change on 10 October 1934, the day where the Physical Culture Palace was opened in Kaunas. The building had a spacious hall with 200 seats, designed and built for tennis. To increase grip for tennis players, the hall had expensive cork floor installed, which cost over 30,000 LTL (over $5,000) when average teacher salary at the time was around 350–500 LTL and 150–180 LTL for an ordinary worker.[24] Being suitable for indoor basketball, the Hall hosted its first game on 16 November 1934, and soon became the main center for basketball events.[25]

In 1935, Lithuania decided to promote a World Lithuanian Congress in temporary capital Kaunas, inviting ethnic Lithuanians from many countries to unite the Lithuanian culture. The Lithuanian American community of Chicago decided to sponsor a team of athletes to participate in this Congress. The delegation included a full basketball team, which included University of Notre Dame star Moose Krause (Edward Kriaučiūnas) and his brother Phil (Feliksas Kriaučiūnas); basketballers Benedict Budrikas, Anthony Lauraitis, Victor Yanzanaitis and Julius Petrulaitis; and multi-sport athletes Konstantinas ""Konnie"" Savickus, Juozas ""Joseph"" Zukas, Peter Barskis, Michael A. Lukas, and Kazys ""Charles"" Sedvilas.[26] After the three-week congress, Zukas and Savickus stayed to teach basketball secrets to Lithuanians.[27] Savickus in particular became a player-coach to the national team, which had just been trounced by inaugural European champions Latvia, 123–10. One year later, with Savickus leading the team and exploiting stalling techniques, Lithuania trailed only 14–7 at halftime before losing, 31–10. The Lithuanian press declared it a moral victory.[28]

Also in 1936, Lithuania applied to become a member of FIBA and take part in international basketball competitions,[29] the first being EuroBasket 1937, the second European basketball tournament that the Latvia Basketball Association would organize in Riga as reigning champions.[30] Thus while basketball would become an Olympic sport at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Lithuania decided not to take part in the tournament, instead preparing for the following year.[28] During the Olympics, one of the gold medalists, Frank Lubin, was of Lithuanian heritage, and was invited to visit the Baltic nation by a Lithuanian official in attendance. Going by the Lithuanian name Pranas Lubinas, he spent five months there and served as the country's first knowledgeable coach, helping spread various basketball techniques.[31][32] Filling in for Savickus, who had returned to Chicago, Lubinas led Lithuania to its first victory over Latvia, 36-25.[27]

""Physical Culture Palace director Mr. Augustauskas asked me: Could you win the European championship? I replied: Why not? Lithuanians already made significant progress and with one or two athletes from Chicago we could easily win that championship.""

The preparations for the EuroBasket 1937 started slowly, with players training only 4 hours a week.[34] At first, it was decided that the national team at the tournament would not include any Lithuanian Americans; however the decision was reversed with only one month remaining, once a Latvian newspaper Sporto pasaule had printed an extensive article about the second European championship considering Lithuania the weakest of all contestants.[34][35] Lithuanian player Leonas Baltrūnas was shocked at the article and along with journalist Jonas Narbutas used a translated version of it to request the inclusion of Lithuanian Americans to Vytautas Augustauskas, director of the Physical Culture Palace.[34][35] After a telegram was sent to the USA, two players arrived one month prior to the tournament, Pranas Talzūnas and Feliksas Kriaučiūnas, the latter of whom was designated as player-coach.[34][35] To keep secrecy on how Lithuanian Americans were strengthening the team, all preparation games were cancelled and instead prolonged training sessions before the trip to Riga were held behind closed doors.[34] The national team was being prepared not only technically, but also physically.[34]

Even once the reinforcements were made public, opponents were skeptic, with Talzūnas later remembering other teams felt he and Kriaučiūnas were not quality players as ""everyone thought that a good player must be tall, raising his hand and dunking into the basket.""[34] Furthermore, another member of the Lithuanian team, Baltrūnas, claimed that the Lithuanians were accommodated not in hotel Roma where the chosen teams and more distant countries teams were accommodated, but instead in a more remote hotel (from the venue stadium) near the station and flea market.[35] Also, Baltrūnas pointed out that unlike other foreign basketball teams the Lithuanians when their train arrived in Riga were not greet with an orchestra and by none of the representatives of EuroBasket 1937.[35]

The efforts were successful—the Lithuanians in 1937 became the champions of Europe for the first time, defeating all their opponents and with Talzūnas being picked as the tournament's most valuable player, also it is believed that Talzūnas was the first-ever basketball player to use a hook shot in an official game during EuroBasket 1937.[36] Following the final victory over Italy, the famous Lithuanian tenor Kipras Petrauskas even interrupted his performance at the State Theatre to joyfully announce the triumph of the national basketball team. The crowd then rose to their feet and together sang the Lithuanian anthem.[37][35] The team returned to a warm reception, with thousands gathering at a train station in a way Kriaučiūnas compared to ""like we, here in America, greet the president.""[38] According to Eugenijus Nikolskis, the Lithuanian national team's train was greet by Lithuanians with Lithuanian tricolor flags and banners just after crossing the Latvia–Lithuania border and were met with stops ceremonially in Joniškis, Šiauliai before arriving in Kaunas where tens of thousands of people gathered to welcome the champions in the Kaunas railway station and Vytauto Avenue through which the team was transported in convertibles to the Physical Culture Palace where they were congratulated by the Government of Lithuania and Prime Minister Juozas Tūbelis and subsequently by Lithuanian President Antanas Smetona.[35]

As a result of the success in EuroBasket 1937, basketball regained its ground in Lithuania immediately, and had its popularity rise abruptly, especially among students. Gymnasium teams from almost all counties competed in student games, teams were assembled in firms and basketball courts appeared all around the country. According to future player Stepas Butautas, ""In every yard hoops are being made from barrels. Children, teenagers are throwing balls into them, others—even a sock crammed with clouts. Our Veršvai Primary School teacher K. Požemecka built two poles, made hoops from a willow and said: 'We will play basketball'.""[39] Future team coach Vladas Garastas added that ""as kids we started using a barrel to make a hoop. We didn't have a ball, we stuffed in grass or whatever we could find"".[40]

Kriaučiūnas also coached the women's national team that did well at the first European women's basketball championship, organized in 1938 in Rome. With three victories in four games, the Lithuanian women finished second behind hosts Italy.[41]

Lithuania was granted the right to organize the EuroBasket 1939. In addition, the Kaunas Sports Hall, Europe's first dedicated basketball arena, was built. In the competition, the team roster mostly consisted of Lithuanian Americans, with five American-born players: the returning Feliksas Kriaučiūnas (Chicago), Juozas Jurgėla (Chicago), Vytautas Budriūnas (Waukegan), Mykolas Ruzgys and Pranas Lubinas (Glendale). As a result, there were several protests from other nations.[42] Lubinas, who was the designated player-coach, lead Lithuania to a second continental title, even scoring the buzzer-beater in the decisive game against Latvia, which warranted a 37–36 victory.[43][44] After the Lithuania's victory versus Latvia 10,000 people sang the Lithuanian anthem.[35] Immediately after the final game versus Italy the closing ceremony was held and Lithuanians were awarded with Smetona's gift – a dowry chest made from silver and decorated with ambers.[45] Moreover, on 8 June 1939 yet another event with 4,000 spectators was held in the Kaunas Sports Hall to pay homage to the 1939 European champions during which they were awarded with Smetona's personal gifts (nominal watches) and other institutions gifts.[45]

After two consecutive EuroBasket titles, Pranas Lubinas dreamed of leading Lithuania at the 1940 Summer Olympics. Sadly, it remained only a dream as the World War II broke out one year before and the Olympics were cancelled.[43] With Nazi Germany invading Europe and the Soviet Union occupying the Baltic states in 1940, the Lithuanian basketball players and basketball-supporting president Antanas Smetona left for safer countries such as the United States and Australia. Only a few of them had a chance to return to Lithuania in 1989-1990.[46] As a consequence, none of the European champions played for the Soviet Union after the war ended. The EuroBasket 1941 was due to take place in Lithuania as well, but was cancelled due to the war.[47] Instead, Lithuania only hosted a Baltic states tournament organized at Kaunas Sports Hall in April 1941, beating Latvia 38–33 in front of 6000 spectators.[29] Two months later, mass Soviet deportations from Lithuania began. Juozas Butrimas, Siberia deportations survivor, once said: ""Our whole sports club was falsely accused of participating in an anti-Soviet Lithuanian resistance organization. In Siberia, we built a regulation basketball court. Basketball allowed us to have dignity, to retain our sense of humanity. How did I survived? Basketball gave a lot. They didn't bury me there"".[48]

During the rest of the war, with the Germans occupying Lithuania in November 1941 and the Soviets taking it back three years later, all the basketballers who did not escape the country went through difficult times. Vincas Sercevičius, often nicknamed as the second Lubinas, had to run away from German raids in 1943. Two years later, Sercevičius was a member of the Žalgiris Kaunas who refused to purposefully lose to CSKA Moscow, leading him and other teammates (e.g. 1939 European champion Mindaugas Šliūpas), along with coach Stasys Šačkus (1937 European champion), to end up shipped to the Vorkuta Gulag by the Soviets.[49][50][51][52][53] Basketball was a popular sport in Soviet gulags among the Lithuanians and basketball clubs in Soviet gulags were especially actively established after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953.[54][52] The Lithuanian basketball clubs were established in Soviet gulags which were located in Komi, Mordovia, Kazakh SSR, Omsk Oblast, Irkutsk Oblast and were named with patriotic names such as Geležinis vilkas, Tauras (depicted in the coat of arms of Kaunas), Pilėnai, Žalgiris, etc.[55] The exact number of Lithuanian basketball clubs which were established in Soviet gulags is unknown, however there were certainly tens of them and when such clubs lacked enough Lithuanians then their teams were assembled by including Latvians and Estonians.[56] Moreover, it is known that frequently Lithuanian basketball players in Soviet gulags played by being exhausted from hunger and that they used to save their food rations which they subsequently shared after tournaments with others more exhausted basketball players.[56]

""Actually, Russia took over the Lithuanians technique and tactics. The last time I saw them was when I was in Prague with the French team. I wished to cry due to joy because the squad had four Lithuanians, one of them was team's captain. I spoke with Lithuanians several times, but I couldn't more.""

The first Soviet Union national basketball team was formed in 1947 to participate in EuroBasket 1947, immediately winning gold medals. The team had four Lithuanians: Stepas Butautas, Justinas Lagunavičius, Kazimieras Petkevičius and Vytautas Kulakauskas.[58] According to Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus, who being as a kid spectated live EuroBasket 1939, basketball for the Lithuanian youth was a symbol of Lithuania's independence, no matter what color shirts the Lithuanian basketball players sometimes had to wear.[59]

Given the Soviet Union was absent from the 1948 Summer Olympics, Lithuanian basketballers could only fulfill their dreams of playing on the Olympic stage at the 1952 Olympic Games, where they qualified by winning EuroBasket 1951. The Soviets got a silver medal, losing only two games against the United States, who had a height advantage—the shortest of their players was still taller than the highest Soviet—and would soon become the USSR's biggest rival.[60][61] The team was led by Georgian player Otar Korkia (17.3 points per game), along with Lithuanians Stepas Butautas (10.6 points) and Kazimieras Petkevičius (8.1 points). Two other Lithuanians, Justinas Lagunavičius and Stanislovas Stonkus, were also in the team.[62] The four are regarded as the first Lithuania-born Olympic basketball players.[63] Years later, Modestas Paulauskas served as the Soviet Union captain starting in 1969, and would lead the USSR to an historic upset of the United States at the 1972 Olympic Games, making them the first Olympic champions other than the Americans.[28][64]

According to journalist and future LKL employee Arūnas Pakula, ""We felt like an occupied nation. We had no weapons to use. The only opportunity to prove ourselves against the Soviets was in basketball.""[65] Despite not being able to challenge the Soviet Union on basketball court, Lithuanians still did that in another way. Basketball club Žalgiris Kaunas, established in 1944 (just a few years after the country's occupation) with a name commemorating the Battle of Grunwald, became one of the main non-violent resistance ways.[66] Games between Žalgiris and CSKA Moscow, a military basketball team mostly formed from best Soviet Union basketball players, were de facto games between Lithuania and the Soviet Union, and led to mass rallies of sorts once Lithuanians went to receive Žalgiris' players at airports after victories.[66] The teams from Baltic states even tried to help each other during the Soviet tournaments, most notably in 1973.[66] During the last round, the already qualified Žalgiris Kaunas deliberately lost to Kalev Tallinn, as admitted by Paulauskas: ""We gave victory to Tallinn Kalev. That game meant nothing for us, while for Estonians it was crucial in order to avoid the fight for the survival in the highest league"".[66]

During the Soviet Era of Stagnation and subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the success of Lithuanian basketball provided many moments to showcase their nationalism against the Soviet dominance. The 1981 students sport games in Vilnius had the locals attending in the Lithuanian green and yellow colors to see the national youth team led by Arvydas Sabonis and Šarūnas Marčiulionis defeat the Moscow squad.[66] In the 1980s, Žalgiris defeated CSKA three times in a row for the USSR Premier Basketball League finals (1985–1987). One of their players, Sergejus Jovaiša, stated that in 1987 CSKA was even preparing a huge celebration with orchestra and flowers before the defeat.[66] Žalgiris also won the 1986 Intercontinental Cup in Argentina, receiving much support from the home crowd against the Yugoslavs of Zagreb Cibona. Their return to Europe attracted a huge crowd, with Žalgiris captain Valdemaras Chomičius stating that in Aleksotas Airport ""it seemed that the whole Kaunas gathered that early morning.""[66]

""When after the war the Russian squad almost defeated USA, some were congratulating me, others were reproachful as they never heard that the Russians were playing basketball. After the war they were using these Lithuanians who I once trained. They took over many techniques and tactics knowledges. I was always observing from far when basketball traditions blossomed in Lithuania and gave such international stars like Arvydas Sabonis. I was proud that the Lithuanians shined more than the others in Seoul. It was mine team. Lithuanian team defeated the Americans, I was telling to the media...""

In 1988, Atlanta Hawks which included its major star Dominique Wilkins became the first NBA club to visit Lithuania and played friendly game with the Soviet Union national team in the Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports.[68][69] Later, the Soviet Union squad became Olympic champions in the 1988 Summer Olympics for the second and the last time, defeating the United States, 82–76, in the semi-finals and Yugoslavia 76–63 in the finals. The team mostly was led by four Lithuanians: Šarūnas Marčiulionis (18.1 points, 2.3 assists per game), Rimas Kurtinaitis (13.4 points, 3 rebounds), Arvydas Sabonis (13.3 points, 11.1 rebounds) and team captain Valdemaras Chomičius (7.4 points, 1.5 rebounds).[70] Vytautas Landsbergis, the first head of state of Lithuania after its independence declaration from the Soviet Union, once said: ""The majority of the team was made up of Lithuanians. So really Lithuania won that gold medal for the Soviet Union. But its name wasn't there. And that was another injustice that we had to correct"".[71]

The Soviet national team failed to qualify for EuroBasket 1991 following Lithuania's declaration of independence on 11 March 1990.[72] During the 43 years where the Soviets had Lithuanian players, they managed to get with both male and female squads 17 Olympic medals (8 gold, 6 silver and 3 bronze), 17 World championship medals (11 gold, 5 silver and one bronze), and 51 EuroBasket medals (36 gold, 4 silver and 11 bronze).[73] The occupation left many painful marks in Lithuania and Lithuanians' memory. Games between Žalgiris and CSKA, as well as games between Lithuania and Russian national teams, still have extra spice in them nowadays.[74] Singing of the Lithuanian anthem before the professional club's games in Lithuania is still a rare tradition, rarely found outside the National Basketball Association in Europe.[75][76]

There have been a few notable Lithuanians who never played for Lithuania national basketball team in FIBA-organized tournaments or the Olympic Games. Most of those lived in the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, who only competed independently in tournaments between the United Republics.

Due to various reasons (especially because of the World Wars) many Lithuanians left their country. As a result of this, there is a group of notable basketball players of Lithuanian descent. A few even expressed interest in playing for the Lithuanian squad.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_in_Lithuania

Liberalism in Lithuania,"This article gives an overview of liberalism in Lithuania. Liberalism was a major force in Lithuania since 1900. Next to the urban citizens, agrarian liberal parties became active. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn't necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

After the restoration of independence in 1990 liberal parties arose again. Currently, the Liberal Movement and Freedom and Justice are centre-right liberal parties, and the Freedom Party is a centrist liberal party.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_Lithuania

Lithuanian book smugglers,"Lithuanian book smugglers or Lithuanian book carriers (Lithuanian: knygnešiaĩ, singular: knygnešys) smuggled Lithuanian language books printed in the Latin alphabet into Lithuanian-speaking areas of the Russian Empire, defying a ban on such materials in force from 1864 to 1904. In Lithuanian knygnešys literally means ""the one who carries books"".  Opposing imperial Russian authorities' efforts to replace the traditional Latin orthography with Cyrillic, and transporting printed matter from as far away as the United States to do so, the book smugglers became a symbol of Lithuanians' resistance to Russification.

After the Polish-Lithuanian insurrection of 1863, the Russian Imperial government intensified its efforts to Russify the Lithuanian population and alienate it from its historic roots, including the Roman Catholic faith, which had become widespread during the years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

During the summer of 1863 Tsar Alexander II issued Temporary Rules for State Junior Schools of the Northwestern Krai, ruling that only Russian-language education would be allowed there. In 1864, the Governor General of the Vilnius Governorate, Mikhail Muravyov, ordered that Lithuanian language primers were to be printed only in the Cyrillic alphabet. Muravyov's successor, Konstantin Kaufman, in 1865 banned all Lithuanian-language use of the Latin alphabet. In 1866, the Tsar issued an oral ban on the printing or importing of printed matter in Lithuanian. Although formally, the order had no legal force, it was executed de facto until 1904. During this time, there were approximately fifty-five printings of Lithuanian books in Cyrillic.

Most of the Latin-alphabet Lithuanian-language books and periodicals published at the time were printed in Lithuania Minor and then smuggled into Lithuania. When caught, the book smugglers were punished by fines, banishment, and exile, including deportation to Siberia. Some were shot after crossing the border.[citation needed]

In 1867, Motiejus Valančius, the Bishop of Samogitia, began to covertly organize and finance this printing abroad and sponsored the distribution of Lithuanian-language books within Lithuania.[1] In 1870, his organization was uncovered with the help of Prussian authorities, and five priests and two book smugglers were exiled to remote areas of Russia. Other book smugglers carried on his work.

During the final years of the ban, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 books were smuggled in annually. About one-third of them were seized by authorities. Lithuanian books reached every settlement in Lithuania, and many legal institutions served as undercover transfer points for the books. A number of secret organizations distributed the books throughout Lithuania, including Sietynas [lt], Atgaja, Teisybė, Prievarta, Aušrinė, Atžala, Lizdas, Akstinas, Spindulys, Svirplys, Žiburėlis, Žvaigždė, and Kūdikis.

In East Prussia since 1864 up to 1896, more than 3 500 000 copies of publications in Lithuanian language was published: about 500 000 primers, more than 300 000 scientific secular editions, 75 000 newspapers and other types of publications.[2]

The ban's lack of success was recognized by the end of the 19th century, and in 1904, under the official pretext that the minorities within the Russian Empire needed to be pacified after the failure in the Russo-Japanese War, the ban on Lithuanian-language publications was lifted.

In 1905, soon after the ban was lifted, one of the book smugglers, Juozas Masiulis [lt], opened his own bookstore in Panevėžys. This bookstore is still operational, and a chain of bookstores operates in Lithuania under his name.[3]

This historical episode was widely suppressed during the years when Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union.[citation needed]

The book smugglers were an important part of the Lithuanian National Revival. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, book smugglers were honored in Lithuania with museums, monuments, and street names. A statue dedicated to ""The Unknown Book Smuggler"" stands in Kaunas. Special relationship of Lithuanians and the book is still seen in the highly popular Vilnius Book Fair. Lithuanian book smugglers helped shape the future. They stood tall for their country and is now honored in many places still.

Book smuggler Jurgis Bielinis, who created a secret distribution network for banned Lithuanian books, was born on 16 March 1846, and this date is commemorated in Lithuania as the Day of the Book Smugglers (Knygnešio diena).[5]

In 1988, the Lithuanian Knygnešiai Association was established at the Lithuanian Culture Foundation. Among its goals was to collect information about all Lithuanian book smugglers and printers. As of 2017[update], four volumes titled Knygnešys were printed. In 1997, the ""Book Smugglers' Wall [lt]"" was unveiled at the Vytautas the Great War Museum. and in 1998 a book Šimtas knygnešių. Knygnešių sienelės vardai (""One Hundred Books Smugglers. Names on the Book Smugglers' Wall"") was published.[6]

During 1959–2000 there was a magazine named Knygnešys [lt] which provided information about (modern) books and book publishers.

In 2018 London Book Fair the tactics of Knygnešiai was used to distribute books of the Lithuanian authors and spread the information about the Lithuanian pavilion.[7]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_book_smugglers
Alexander Jagiellon,"Alexander Jagiellon (Polish: Aleksander Jagiellończyk; Lithuanian: Aleksandras Jogailaitis; 5 August 1461 – 19 August 1506) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1492 and King of Poland from 1501 until his death in 1506.[2] He was the fourth son of Casimir IV and a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty. Alexander was elected grand duke of Lithuania upon the death of his father and became king of Poland upon the death of his elder brother John I Albert.

Alexander was born as the fourth son of King Casimir IV Jagiellon and Elizabeth of Austria, daughter of the King Albert II of Germany. At the time of his father's death in 1492, his eldest brother Vladislaus had already become king of Bohemia (1471) and Hungary and Croatia (1490), and the next oldest brother, Saint Casimir, had died (1484) after leading an ascetic and pious life in his final years, resulting in his eventual canonization. While the third oldest brother, John I Albert was chosen by the Polish nobility (szlachta) to be the next king of Poland, the Lithuanians instead elected Alexander to be their next grand duke. Alexander maintained a Lithuanian court and multiple Lithuanian priests served in his royal chapel of the Polish royal court.[3][4][5]

The greatest challenge that Alexander faced upon assuming control of the grand duchy was an attack on Lithuania by Grand Duke Ivan III of Russia and his allies, the Crimean Khanate's Tatars, which commenced shortly after his accession. Ivan III considered himself the heir to the lands of Kievan Rus', and was striving to take back the territory previously gained by Lithuania.[6] Unable to successfully stop the incursions, Alexander sent a delegation to Moscow to make a peace settlement, which was signed in 1494 and ceded extensive land over to Ivan. In an additional effort to instill a peace between the two countries, Alexander was betrothed to Helena, the daughter of Ivan III; they were married in Vilnius on 15 February 1495. The peace did not last long, however, as Ivan III resumed hostilities in 1500. The most Alexander could do was to garrison Smolensk and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena to mediate another truce between him and her father after the disastrous Battle of Vedrosha (1500). In the terms of this truce, which was concluded on 25 March 1503, Lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist Russian state; Alexander pledged not to touch lands including Moscow, Novgorod, Ryazan, and others, while a total of 19 cities were ceded.[7] Historian Edvardas Gudavičius said:

""The war of 1492–1494 was a kind of reconnaissance mission conducted by the united Russia. [The terms of] the ceasefire of 1503 showed the planned political aggression of Russia, its undoubted military superiority. The concept of the sovereign of all Russia, put forward by Ivan III, did not leave room for the existence of the Lithuanian state"".[7]

On 17 June 1501, Alexander's older brother John I Albert died suddenly, and Alexander was crowned king of Poland on 12 December of that year. Alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and szlachta, who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position. In 1505, the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland passed the Act of Nihil novi, which forbade the king to issue laws without the consent of the nobility, represented by the two legislative chambers, except for laws governing royal cities, crown lands, mines, fiefdoms, royal peasants, and Jews. This was another step in Poland's progression towards a ""Noble's Democracy"".

During Alexander's reign, Poland suffered additional humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, Moldavia. Only the death of Stephen, the great hospodar of Moldavia, enabled Poland still to hold her own on the Danube river. Meanwhile, the liberality of Pope Julius II, who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of Poland and granted Alexander Peter's Pence and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the Teutonic Order.

Alexander Jagiellon never felt at home in Poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow Lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy Lithuanian magnate Michael Glinski, who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the Tatars at Kletsk (5 August 1506), news of which was brought to Alexander on his deathbed in Vilnius.

According to Giedrė Mickūnaitė, interwar Lithuanian historians assumed that Alexander was the last ruler of the Gediminid dynasty who understood the Lithuanian language, yet did not speak it, but there is a lack of sources regarding that.[8]

In 1931, during the refurbishment of Vilnius Cathedral, the forgotten sarcophagus of Alexander was discovered, and has since been put on display.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Jagiellon

Lithuanians in the Chicago area,"Lithuanians in Chicago and the nearby metropolitan area are a prominent group within the ""Windy City"" whose presence goes back over a hundred years. Today the Chicago area possesses the largest Lithuanian community outside Lithuania,[1] who have dubbed the city as Little Lithuania, and many Lithuanian Americans refer to it as the second capital of Lithuania. Lithuanian Americans from Chicago have had a significant impact on politics in both the United States and Lithuania. Census estimates as of 2023 number the Lithuanian population in the Chicago metropolitan area at 59,359.[2] The population is currently declining, influenced partially by Lithuania's 2004 entry into the EU, which has led a decrease in new arrivals to the United States.[3][4]

Lithuanians have been documented as arriving in the US since 1918, when Lithuania re-established its independence from Imperial Russia. Although this is the first official record, Lithuanians began arriving at least two decades earlier; however, they were listed as Russian citizens.[1] This is compounded by the fact that, prior to Lithuanian independence, most if not all official documents were written in Russian, Polish or German. Thousands of Lithuanians have since moved to Chicago, providing a good source of labor for the growing city. The Lithuanian community in Chicago was most famously immortalized by Upton Sinclair in his 1906 novel about the treatment of workers in the Chicago stock yards, The Jungle, whose story revolves around telling the life of a Lithuanian immigrant named Jurgis Rudkus.

The first and most prominent Lithuanian enclave in Chicago was called ""Lithuanian Downtown"" which was located along Halsted street in Bridgeport and founded by Lithuanians who settled nearby their Old World neighbors, the Poles, who were located in a Polish Patch in the vicinity of St. Mary of Perpetual Help. It was here that the Lithuanian church of Saint George was founded as the first Lithuanian parish in the Midwest, foreshadowing the prominence that Bridgeport would play as one of the key centers of Lithuanian activity throughout the United States.[5] A large number of the early buildings of this district were built by the first prominent Lithuanian community leader, Antanas Olšauskas, circa 1910. Centered on Thirty-third and Halsted, Bridgeport was Chicago's leading Lithuanian neighborhood from the 1890s through the 1950s.

Although Lithuanians initially settled in areas adjacent to the ethnic group most familiar from their European homeland, the Poles, a pattern consistent with most other immigrant groups in Chicago, the Lithuanian community today is found all over the Chicago metropolitan area; as of 2023 there are 27,547 people of Lithuanian ancestry living in Cook County alone, with another 8,545 in DuPage County.[6][7] Lithuanian immigrants established enclaves on the Southwest Side of the city during the 20th century, including in Bridgeport, Brighton Park, Marquette Park area, and the Back of the Yards. The adjacent near-western suburb of Cicero had an enclave of Lithuanians in the 20th century,[8] especially around St. Anthony's Parish.[9]
[10] 
The most recent wave of immigrants has settled in the western Chicago suburbs of Lemont, Darien, Homer Glen and Woodridge, towns which all have a sizeable Polish community as well (particularly Lemont and Homer Glen). There is a small enclave of Lithuanians around the Beverly Shores area in northwest Indiana at the southern coast of Lake Michigan, where there is an American-Lithuanian Club.[11][12] Some Lithuanians moved on to work in Southern Illinois coal mines.

Today ""Little Lithuania"" is the center of Lithuanian culture in North America. It has a number of Lithuanian restaurants, bookstores, and other shops. The former president of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus 1998-2003 and 2004–2009, is a former resident of the Chicago area as well. Chicago is home to the Consulate General of the Republic of Lithuania, and the city's large Lithuanian American community maintains close ties to what is affectionately called the Motherland. Chicago's Lithuanian heritage is visible in the cityscape through its Lithuanian-named streets such as Lituanica Avenue and Lithuanian Plaza Court as well as an Art Deco monument in Marquette Park commemorating pilots Stasys Girėnas and Steponas Darius who died in the crash of the aircraft Lituanica in 1933. The area just east of Marquette Park features such institutions as Maria High School, Sisters of St. Casimir Motherhouse,[13] Holy Cross Hospital, and Nativity BVM Catholic Church, which have been associated with Lithuanians.

A number of the most architecturally significant churches of the Archdiocese of Chicago were built as national parishes by Lithuanian immigrants such as Holy Cross, Providence of God, Nativity BVM which is dedicated to Our Lady of Šiluva, and the now demolished St. George's in Bridgeport. Opulently decorated with a proclivity towards Renaissance and Baroque ornamentation, Lithuanian churches were designed in the spirit of the architecture of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's heyday. Like Chicago's Polish Cathedrals, these churches were statements meant to recall an era when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania spanned from the Baltic to the Black Sea, having been built at a time when Lithuania was under Russian occupation and incorporating Lithuanian imagery in its decor such as the Vytis to invoke pride in Lithuanian culture.

The Lithuanian Museum, owned by the Lithuanian Research and Studies Center, operates at the Lithuanian Youth Center (Lietuvių Jaunimo Centras, 5620 S. Claremont Ave.) The Museum is open and accessible when the Youth Center is open.

Opened in 1966, the Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture is located in south Chicago, at 6500 South Pulaski Road. The purpose of the museum is to celebrate and preserve the Lithuanian culture. As a non-profit organization, the museum began its collections from donations from within the community—such as limited antiques from the Balzekas family. Today, the museum offers a variety of exhibits for both children and adults. Every two years the museum organizes tours to Lithuania, where the groups visit the most well-known places in Lithuania.[14]

The Lithuanian Folk Art Institute of Chicago can be found at the Lithuanian World Center, which is located in Lemont. The museum contains a variety of wood carvings, amber jewelry, Lithuanian national clothing pieces, sculptures, and many other traditional folk art.[15]

The Lithuanian cuisine options in Chicago are widespread. Opened in 1938, the Healthy Food restaurant was one of the first well-known Lithuanian restaurants in Chicago located on Halsted near 32nd street, in the Bridgeport neighborhood, a historically Lithuania community. The restaurant decorated the place with a variety of traditional art.[16] The restaurant closed its doors in 2009.[17]

About a block away from the now-closed Healthy Food restaurant is Bernice's Tavern.[18] To this day it is one of the few places you can find Švyturys beer in Chicago. The namesake of the bar passed away in 2017.

A more recent Lithuanian restaurant Grand Duke’s opened in 2005 located on Harlem Avenue. Grand Duke’s has been featured on Check, Please!, PBS, ABC news Hungry Hound and Chicago’s Best. In 2019, they were replaced with Thirsty Pig BBQ & relocated to Downers Grove. In 2012, Grand Duke’s opened up a sister restaurant Old Vilnius located in Darien.[19][20]

There are a number of Lithuanian schools established in or near Chicago. At the Chicago Lithuanian Youth Center, the Lithuanian School of Chicago (Lith.: Čikagos Lituanistinė Mokykla), a private school for Lithuanian immigrant children, was founded in 1992. Other Lithuanian schools include Maironis in Lemont, Gediminas in Waukegan and Rasa in Naperville.

First published in 1903, the Draugas (Friend) is the first Lithuanian newspaper in the United States and is printed by the Lithuanian Catholic Press Society in Chicago. Other Lithuanian publications include Amerikos Lietuvis (Lithuanian American), Vakarai (The West), and Čikagos Aidas (Echo Chicago). These newspapers not only provide news and current events that involve Lithuanians living in Chicago, but also stories from around the entire world, such as economic, political and social trends relevant to Lithuanian-speaking peoples. These publications can most often be found in local stores in which Lithuanians shop at, some examples are Brookhaven in Darien, Peter’s Deli in Lemont, and Lassak Deli in Willowbrook and these are also found online.[21][22]

Naujienos was printed from 1914 through the 1980s, Vilnis was printed from 1920-1989, Liaudies Menas (The People's Art) was printed 1950–1951.

Years ago, the Lithuanian Song festival (Dainų Šventė) and Dance Festival (Šokių Šventė) have been held at the now-demolished International Amphitheatre, originally near the Stockyards on the south side of Chicago. In 2015, the Song Festival has been held at the UIC Pavilion[23][24] a couple of times and the Dance Festival held in the suburb of Rosemont, not far from Chicago O'Hare Airport.

The Lithuanian Opera Company of Chicago was founded by Lithuanian emigrants in 1956, and presents operas in Lithuanian.[25] Lithuanian operas were sometimes held at Maria High School in Chicago, a school that has been associated with Lithuanians, and such operas are now sometimes held at Morton East High School in Cicero.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanians_in_the_Chicago_area
Lithuanian–Soviet War,"The Lithuanian–Soviet War or Lithuanian–Bolshevik War (Lithuanian: karas su bolševikais) was fought between newly independent Lithuania and the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic in the aftermath of World War I. It was part of the larger Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919. The offensive followed the retreat of German troops and sought to establish Soviet republics in Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and link up with the German Revolution.[3] By the end of December 1918 Soviet forces reached Lithuanian borders. Largely unopposed, they occupied one town after another and by the end of January 1919 controlled about two thirds of the Lithuanian territory. In February, the Soviet advance was stopped by Lithuanian and German volunteers, who prevented the Soviets from capturing Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. From April 1919, the Lithuanian war went parallel with the Polish–Soviet War. Poland had territorial claims over Lithuania, especially the Vilnius Region; these tensions spilt over into the Polish–Lithuanian War.

British-Polish historian Norman Davies summarized the situation: ""the German army was supporting the Lithuanian nationalists, the Soviets were supporting the Lithuanian communists and the Polish Army was fighting them all.""[4] In mid-May, the Lithuanian army, now commanded by General Silvestras Žukauskas, began an offensive against the Soviets in Northeastern Lithuania. By mid-June, the Lithuanians reached the Latvian border and cornered the Soviets among lakes and hills near Zarasai, where the Soviets held out until the end of August 1919. The Soviets and Lithuanians, separated by the Daugava River, maintained their fronts until the Battle of Daugavpils in January 1920. As early as September 1919, the Soviets offered to negotiate a peace treaty, but talks began only in May 1920. The Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed on July 12, 1920. Soviet Russia fully recognized independent Lithuania.

Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire after the final partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. During World War I, Lithuania was occupied by Germany and made part of Ober Ost. On February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared independence from both Germany and Russia. Three weeks later, the Bolsheviks, encumbered with the Russian Civil War, sued for peace with the Central Powers and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. They renounced Russian claims to Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland.[5] However, the Lithuanians were only allowed minimal autonomy and could not establish de facto independence.[6] That changed when Germany lost the war and signed the Compiègne Armistice of 11 November 1918. Lithuania soon began organizing basic institutions and established its first government led by Augustinas Voldemaras.

On November 13, 1918, the Soviet Russian government renounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which had assured Lithuania's independence.[5] The Bolshevik Western Army followed retreating German troops maintaining a distance of  10–15 kilometres (6.2–9.3 mi) between the two armies.[7] Demoralized Germans often left valuable armaments and other equipment to the Soviets.[8] The Soviets attempted to spread the global proletarian revolution and sought to establish Soviet republics in the region. They saw Baltic states as a barrier or a bridge into Western Europe, where they could join the German and the Hungarian revolutions.[9] By the end of December 1918, Bolshevik forces reached eastern Lithuania.

Augustinas Voldemaras, the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, did not believe that forming the military was a priority and advocated Lithuanian neutrality.[10] He trusted that German mercenaries would protect Lithuania until the upcoming Paris Peace Conference could establish peace.[11] Residents organized local self-defense units to defend themselves from the retreating Germans.[10] The first laws regarding the army were not issued until November 23. Some Lithuanians, who had served in the Russian army during the World War, returned to Lithuania and started organizing battalions in Kaunas, Gardinas, Alytus.[10] They lacked guns, ammunition, and officers.

At the end of December, with the Bolsheviks already in the country, Lithuania was left leaderless. Augustinas Voldemaras, Antanas Smetona, Chairman of the Council of Lithuania, and Martynas Yčas, minister of finance, departed for Germany to ask for financial assistance.[2] General Kiprijonas Kundratavičius, vice minister of defense, suggested a retreat to Gardinas and refused to command the Lithuanian defense.[10] The first cabinet of ministers resigned on December 26, 1918. Mykolas Sleževičius stepped in and organized a new government. On December 29, he issued the first mass appeal in four languages calling for volunteers for the Lithuanian Army.[12] Sleževičius' government adopted a new policy on land reform, which could be summarized in a slogan ""land for those who cultivate it.""[13] It meant the land would be taken from large landowners and redistributed first to the volunteers for free and then to small peasants for a fee.[14] Mobilization of officers was announced only on January 25; about 400 people responded.[12]

In Berlin, Smetona and Yčas signed a loan agreement with Germany for 100 million marks.[13] The money was used primarily to build and supply the army. They further negotiated direct German support in the war against the Soviets. Article 12 of the Compiègne Armistice required the Germans to protect Lithuania from possible Soviet attacks,[15] but Germany was also interested in maintaining its influence in the region and weakening Russia.[16] At first they tried to organize volunteers from the retreating soldiers of the 10th German Army, commanded by General Erich von Falkenhayn. However, the soldiers were tired and demoralized and wanted to return home as soon as possible.[17] Recruitment continued in Germany, especially in Saxony. The volunteers were paid 30 marks per month plus 5 marks per day and had to sign up for three months.[18] The first Saxon volunteers, as they became known, arrived in Kaunas at the beginning of January, but quite a few of them were judged unfit for duty and sent back. By the end of January, German volunteers numbered 4,000.[18] They were unreliable, as the German Revolution increased the popularity of the Spartacus League and Soviet causes. There were several attempts at a coup against the Lithuanian government.[18] These volunteers were stationed in and around Kaunas: Alytus, Jonava, Kėdainiai, and Baisogala.[18]

At first, they were organized into the 46th Saxon Volunteer Division.[18] On February 22, Lieutenant-General Walter von Eberhardt became its commander. In April–May, German forces were reorganized into the South Lithuania Volunteer Brigade, composed of three regiments, (18th, 19th, and 20th) and a separate battalion in Raseiniai.[19] The 18th Regiment fought alongside Lithuanians; the 19th Regiment guarded the Kaunas area and did not participate in battle; the 20th Regiment was stationed in Gardinas and then in Kėdainiai; the separate battalion joined the Bermontians.[18] The Baltische Landeswehr, led by General Rüdiger von der Goltz, organized a coup against the Latvian government and captured Riga. On May 23, the Paris Peace Conference, reacting to these events, asked Germany to withdraw its troops from both Latvia and Lithuania as soon as local forces could defend themselves.[20] The last Saxon Volunteers left Lithuania in mid-July.[21]

On 8 December 1918, a revolutionary government was formed from members of the Communist Party of Lithuania, chaired by Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas.[2] On December 16, the revolutionary government declared the establishment of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. Between 31 December 1918 and 1 January 1919, the German garrison withdrew from Vilnius and passed authority over the city to a local Polish committee, against the pleas of the Lithuanian administration.[22] The Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence, which aligned itself with Poland, took over the posts. The Lithuanian government withdrew to Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania.[23] On January 5, 1919, Vilnius was taken by the Soviets after a five-day fight with Polish paramilitary platoons led by general Władysław Wejtko. Kapsukas and his government arrived in Vilnius from Daugavpils on January 7.[24] On February 27, the Lithuanian SSR was incorporated into the Socialist Soviet Republic of Lithuania and Belorussia or Litbel.

In the occupied territory the Soviets created revolutionary committees and soviets based on structures developed in Russia.[25] Unlike elsewhere, Lithuanian communist organizations were young and had not yet developed a network of supporting local councils.[9] They nationalized commercial institutions and large estates. The land was to be used for collective farming instead of being redistributed to small farmers.[26] The Soviet propagated internationalism and atheism in a country of staunch Catholics and determined nationalists.[25][27] Soviets were supported by the industrial working class, but it was too small in Lithuania.[27] The Soviets demanded large war contributions from captured cities and villages. For example, Panevėžys was required to pay 1,000,000, Utena – 200,000, villagers – 10 rubles.[28] Such policies alienated the local population and contributed to the eventual defeat of the Soviets.[27] For example, in February, Kapsukas sent a telegram to Moscow arguing that conscription of local Lithuanians to the Red Army would only encourage Lithuanians to volunteer for the Lithuanian army.[25]

Soviet troops (about 18,000[29] to 20,000 men[30]) approached the Lithuanian territory on December 12, 1918.[30] About 5,000 of them were Lithuanians.[31] Three divisions were employed: Pskov Division (later renamed as the Lithuanian Division), International Division (later renamed as the 2nd Latvian Rifle Division; included 39th, 41st, 47th, and 60th Regiments), and 17th Division (later renamed as Western Division; included 5th Vilnius Regiment).[28] The divisions did not have a common military commander.[19] Later, more units were sent from Russia. The Soviets also recruited partisan groups behind the front lines.[31] Soviet soldiers were poorly supplied and relied on requisitioning food, horses, and clothes from locals.[25] Lithuania could not offer serious resistance as at the time its army consisted only of about 3,000 untrained volunteers.[32] Only local partisans, armed with weapons acquired from retreating Germans, offered brief resistance.

Red Army captured one town after another: Zarasai and Švenčionys (Dec. 22), Utena (Dec. 23), Rokiškis and Vilnius[33] (Jan. 5), Ukmergė and Panevėžys (Jan. 9), Šiauliai (Jan. 15), Telšiai (Jan. 25).[30] That accounted for about 2⁄3 of the Lithuanian territory. The front somewhat stabilized when Soviet forces were stopped near the Venta River by Latvian and German units (Baltische Landeswehr).[34] Also, Germans slowed down the withdrawal of their troops after the Spartacist uprising was subdued on January 12.[35] Southern Lithuania was a little better protected as Germans retreated from Ukraine through Gardinas. To prevent fights between retreating Germans and the Red Army, the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty on January 18. The treaty drew a temporary demarcation line that went through Daugai, Stakliškės, and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of the Kaišiadorys–Jonava–Kėdainiai railway.[36] That barred Bolshevik forces from directly attacking Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city. The Red Army would need to encircle Kaunas and attack through Alytus or Kėdainiai. The operation to take Kaunas began on February 7.

Kėdainiai was attacked by the 2nd Rifle Regiment of the Lithuanian (former Pskov) Division (about 1,000 men). Lithuanian forces from Panevėžys, commanded by Jonas Variakojis, and from Kėdainiai numbered only about 200 men.[36] Lithuanians withstood Red Army advance near Kėdainiai and with German support repelled it. On February 8, during the course of a reconnaissance mission, Povilas Lukšys became the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the war.[37] On February 10, joint Lithuanian and German forces captured Šėta and forced the Red Army to retreat. The operation's success lifted the Lithuanian army's morale and prevented the Red Army from encircling Kaunas from the north.[36]

On February 9, Soviet 7th Rifle Regiment (900 men) seized Jieznas, south of Kaunas.[38] The battle of Jieznas lasted three days, and, after the setback of the betrayal by a Russian officer in Lithuanian service, Lithuanians, together with German support, ultimately won on February 13 and liberated Jieznas.[39] The Soviets continued to push for Kaunas. The 3rd and 4th Rifle Regiments (about 2,000 men) attacked Alytus on February 12. Germans did not engage in battle and retreated; not yet fully formed Lithuanian 1st Infantry Regiment could not withstand pressure from the Red Army and had to retreat towards Marijampolė and Prienai.[40] Antanas Juozapavičius, the first Lithuanian officer to die in the wars, was killed during this battle. On the night of February 14–15, German forces and one company of the Lithuanians returned to Alytus and once more liberated the city.[41] Kaunas was defended and the front stabilized for a while. Soviets were ordered to abandon the offensive and maintain a defensive position.[42] This break allowed Lithuanians to better organize and train the volunteers.

Northern Lithuania (Samogitia) was overtaken by the Soviet International Division (about 3,000 men). Its objective was to reach the Baltic Sea and cut off German supplies to Latvians in their war against the Soviets.[43] Local communists were more active in northern Lithuania as the shortest route for Russian prisoners to return to Russia was through Samogitia.[44] Their biggest achievement was forming a 1,000-man Samogitian Regiment, commanded by Feliksas Baltušis-Žemaitis, in the city of Šiauliai. The regiment included Russian POWs, German deserters, and criminals.[45] There were no units of regular Lithuanian army in Samogitia except for partisans in Skuodas, rallied by Povilas Plechavičius and his brother Aleksandras, and in Joniškėlis.[36]

The movement of the Bolsheviks towards East Prussia worried Germany, and they sent volunteers (Brigade Schaulen) commanded by General Rüdiger von der Goltz to free a section of the Libau–Romny Railway line linking Liepāja, Mažeikiai, Radviliškis, and Kėdainiai.[46] It was part of a larger counter-offensive in Latvia.[47] At the end of February, the Lithuanian partisans, supported by German artillery, liberated Mažeikiai and Seda, and pursued the Bolsheviks to Kuršėnai. On February 27, 1919, German volunteers supported by Plechavičius' partisans and Joniškėlis' partisans, defeated the Samogitian Regiment in a battle near Luokė.[45] The regiment disbanded. Before mid-March, the Germans took Kuršėnai, Šiauliai, Radviliškis, Šeduva, Joniškis and stopped.[48] On few occasions, they were aided by Lithuanian partisans and regular units. Joniškėlis' partisans continued to guard the front along the Mūša River.[49] They were later incorporated into regular Lithuanian military.[50]

As the Soviet forces were stopped, the Lithuanian army slowly began preparing itself for an offensive. After the Battle of Kėdainiai, the Panevėžys volunteer regiment had secured its positions and grew in strength.[51] Between mid-February and end of March, it carried out small expeditions into nearby towns. Their main purpose was to demoralize the enemy forces and boost the confidence of locals and Lithuanian volunteers.[52] As a reward for its successful operations, the volunteer regiment was named the Separate Panevėžys Battalion (Lithuanian: Panevėžio atskirasis batalionas) on March 22.[53] Demoralization campaign was successful: the Bolshevik forces stationed in Panevėžys and Kupiškis rebelled and were quelled only by a Red Army division from neighbouring Latvia.[54] The Bolshevik morale underwent deeper declines and, between March 19 and March 24, their forces left Panevėžys. Lithuanian forces entered the city on March 26, but the Red Army retook it on April 4.[55]

The lull between Soviet attacks was used to strengthen and organize the army. On March 5, Lithuanians announced the mobilization of men born in 1887–1889.[2] Lithuanian forces rapidly increased their numbers. By May 3, the official headcount reached 440 officers and 10,729 privates.[56] However, only about half of them were properly trained, armed, and assigned to military units.[56] In February–April, Lithuanian soldiers were actively undergoing training, the chain of command was streamlined, new military units formed. Lithuania also received new shipments of arms and munitions. Soldiers received first uniforms.[57]

The first organized Lithuanian offensive was carried out on April 3–8, 1919. Lithuanians decided to take advantage of large Polish attacks against the Soviets in the area near Gardinas to test enemy strength and liberate Vilnius.[57] The southern group, formed based on the 1st Infantry Regiment and led by Kazys Ladiga, was to attack from Alytus along the Daugai–Valkininkai line.[57] The northern group, formed on the basis on the 2nd Infantry Regiment and led by Juozas Butkus, was to attack from Kaišiadorys along the Žasliai–Vievis line.[57] Germans did not participate. Both regiments were initially successful, but the Soviets gathered their forces and stopped the advance. As Lithuanian flanks were not defended, they decided to abandon the offensive. Soviets also accused Germans of violating the demarcation line set on January 18 and pressured them to retreat.[49]

Poland started an offensive against the Soviets in March 1919. They pushed east and north, entering Vilnius Region, the territory claimed by Lithuanians. Between April 19 and 21, Poles captured Vilnius during the Vilna offensive and by May secured their positions.[58] The Polish army forced the Soviets to withdraw their left wing from the territories south of the Neris River. This Polish advance significantly shortened the Lithuanian–Soviet front line and allowed Lithuania to concentrate its forces for operations in northeastern Lithuania.[59] However, it also meant that a new front line with Poland was open. At first, both Poles and Lithuanians cooperated against the Soviets, but soon the cooperation gave way to increasing hostility.[60] The first clashes between Polish and Lithuanian soldiers occurred on April 26 and May 8 near Vievis.[61]

Poland did not recognize Lithuania as its Chief of State Józef Piłsudski wanted a union with Lithuania in hopes of reviving the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Międzymorze federation).[26] Poland justified its actions not only as part of a military campaign against the Soviets but also as the right of self-determination of local Poles, who formed a significant minority in eastern Lithuania.[62] Lithuanians claimed Vilnius as their historical capital and opposed to any federation with Poland, desiring an independent national Lithuanian state.[58] The Lithuanian government in Kaunas saw the Polish presence in Vilnius as an occupation. In addition to the Vilnius Region, the nearby Suwałki Region was also disputed. The Polish–Lithuanian relations were not immediately hostile but grew worse as each side refused to compromise.[60]

Polish advances against the Soviets necessitated changes in Lithuanian strategy. On April 26, General Silvestras Žukauskas, who just recovered from typhus, was designated Chief of the General Staff.[19] He decided to mount an offensive in northeastern Lithuania. The first objective was to take over Ukmergė. On May 3, the Separate Panevėžys Volunteer Regiment, supported by the 18th Regiment of Saxon Volunteers, had secured the town. The operation was risky as for a while Kėdainiai was unprotected opening a path to Kaunas,[32] but also very successful: some 500 Soviet soldiers were taken prisoner and about 50 Poles, captured by the Soviets in the battles near Vilnius, were liberated and returned to Poland.[63] On May 7, Lithuanians entered Širvintos, where they found Polish troops. Lithuanians and Poles mounted a joint operation to take Giedraičiai on May 9.[32]

The Lithuanian army's chain of command was reformed. On May 7, General Žukauskas assumed command of the entire Lithuanian army and initiated a complete reorganization of the Lithuanian forces into two groups.[64] The first brigade, stationed in Ukmergė, was called the Vilkmergė Group and included a battalion of Saxon Volunteers. Its first commander Kazys Ladiga was ordered to push along the Utena–Zarasai line.[32] The second brigade, called the Panevėžys Group, was charged with capturing Panevėžys and then pushing along the Kupiškis–Rokiškis–Obeliai line.[32] The group, initially commanded by Jonas Variakojis, was aided by Joniškėlis' partisans from the north. The Ministry of Defense and the General Staff were also reorganized.[64]

On May 18, the reorganized army carried out its first operation. The Vilkmergė Group captured Kurkliai and Anykščiai.[65] On May 22, the Group launched an attack on Utena. The initiative was met by a Soviet counterattack and the Lithuanian forces retreated. Further attacks were stopped for several days to wait for the results of the advance on Kupiškis.[66] The drive towards Utena resumed on May 31, and the city was secured on June 2. The Panevėžys Group launched a drive towards Panevėžys on May 18 and secured the city the following day, but lost it to a Bolshevik counterattack, carried out on May 21.[32] However, the Soviets left Panevėžys without a fight two days later.[67] The Group charged towards Kupiškis and secured Subačius. On May 30, Joniškėlis' partisans broke through the Soviet lines and liberated Rokiškis in Soviet rear;[68] Bolshevik forces, afraid that they could be encircled, left Kupiškis on the night of May 30–31, and Lithuania secured that city on June 1.[69]

After Utena's liberation, Saxon Volunteers left the front and by mid-July departed Lithuania.[32] However, Lithuanian advance continued and, on June 10, Lithuanian forces reached the territory controlled by Latvian partisans (Green Guard) and supplied them with munitions.[70] On June 12, the Soviets counterattacked and Lithuanians were stopped. Another Soviet push came on June 20 and the front stabilized.[71] The Soviets were cornered in a small region around Zarasai. Between July 6 and 12, Lithuanians with some Latvian assistance attempted to drive out the Bolsheviks. The Soviets gathered their forces from calmer fronts and forced Lithuanians to retreat to their former positions.[68]

While Lithuanian forces battled the Soviets in northeastern Lithuania, the tension between Poland and Lithuania grew. Direct negotiations between May 28 and June 11, 1919, collapsed as neither side was inclined to compromise.[72] Trying to prevent a direct military conflict, the Allied Supreme Council drew the first demarcation line on June 18, 1919.[62] The line was drawn several kilometres west of the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway. Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected it as it required the Polish forces to retreat up to 30–35 km (19–22 mi); Lithuanians were discontent as well, as it left Vilnius and Gardinas under Polish control.[73] As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania (their last units left Kaunas in mid-July), Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km (62 mi) wide front moving 20–30 km (12–19 mi) deeper into the Lithuanian territory.[74] Preoccupied with the Soviet threat, Lithuania could not organize an effective defence and the Entente intervened again by drawing the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line, on July 26, 1919. Two major modifications were made: Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km (4.3 mi) west.[75] Neither Lithuanians, Poles, nor Germans (still present in the Suwałki Region) were content with the new demarcation line.[76] Between July 29 and August 2, Polish troops attacked Lithuanians several times.[77] On August 3, a Polish diplomatic mission in Kaunas declared that Poland has no plans to annex Lithuania and proposed a plebiscite in the contested territories, allowing local inhabitants to determine their future.[78] When the Lithuanian government rejected the Polish proposal, Józef Piłsudski decided that further military action was not a solution. Instead, the Lithuanian government itself needed to be replaced by a party more willing to negotiate a compromise.[78][79] The front stabilized, but bilateral relations worsened in the aftermath of the Sejny Uprising (August 23 – September 9) which in turn ruined the attempted coup d'état by the Polish Military Organisation against the Lithuanian government (August 28–29).[80]

Due to the threat from Poland, the front with the Soviets was quiet for more than a month. There were minor incidents involving scouts or outpost guards.[81] The Red Army used the time to reorganize and strengthen their forces, using natural barriers, like plentiful lakes, rivers, and hills, enhanced with trenches and barbed wires, to secure their position.[82] They also had field fortifications from World War I about 10 km (6.2 mi) south of Daugavpils.[68] The Soviets had larger forces: Lithuanians had two infantry regiments and five separate battalions; the Soviets had six regiments and one separate battalion.[68] Together, the Lithuanians and the Poles planned to advance to Daugavpils starting August 9, but the plans were delayed until August 23.[83]

The Ukmergė Group attacked first and liberated Zarasai on August 25. The Group moved about 30 km (19 mi) into the Soviet-controlled territory, but neither the right nor left flanks were adequately protected by the Polish units or the Panevėžys Group.[84] The Panevėžys Group began advancing on August 26 and Polish troops moved along the railroad towards Turmantas.[85] The Lithuanians manoeuvred around the old Russian fortifications, forcing the Red Army to retreat.[68] Converging on Daugavpils, the Lithuanian–Soviet front shortened and the Lithuanians were able to concentrate their forces.[86] On August 28, the Soviets began retreating north across the Daugava River.[87] By August 31, on the southern shore of the Daugava, the Soviet held only Grīva, a suburb of Daugavpils.[88]

The Bolshevik enemy was driven out from the Lithuanian territory and the narrow front stabilized as Lithuanians and Soviets were separated by the Daugava River. The Lithuanian main forces could be redeployed elsewhere, including protection of the demarcation line with Poland and the planned attacks against the Bermontians in northern Lithuania.[1] In September 1919, joint Polish and Latvian forces took Daugava's southern shore, including Grīva. The Lithuanian–Soviet front remained open until the Battle of Daugavpils when Latvian and Polish forces captured Daugavpils in January 1920. The Lithuanians did not participate in these operations.[89] The Lithuanians claimed the territory, taken by their soldiers, for themselves despite Latvian protests.[90] This led to several skirmishes between Latvian and Lithuanian troops, but the border issue was successfully mediated by Britain and finally resolved in March 1921.[90]

The first Lithuanian–Soviet attempt at negotiations took place on 11 September 1919, after the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia, Georgy Chicherin, sent a note with a proposal for a peace treaty.[91] However, Lithuania delayed the talks as it feared that negotiations with communist Russia, which was isolated from European politics, would damage its relationships with the Allied Powers that had not yet recognized Lithuania.[91] The talks began only in May 1920 and were highly influenced by the events in the Polish–Soviet War. The Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was concluded on July 12. Russia recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region; in exchange, Lithuania granted Soviet forces unrestricted movement during the war against Poland.[80] This compromised Lithuania's declared neutrality and further deepened the Polish–Lithuanian crisis.[92]

On 14 July 1920, the Soviets occupied Vilnius but did not transfer the city to the Lithuanian administration as agreed in the peace treaty. Instead, the Soviets planned a coup to overthrow the Lithuanian government and establish a Soviet republic.[92] However, the Soviets lost the Battle of Warsaw and were pushed back by the Poles. Some historians credit this victory for saving Lithuania's independence from the Soviet coup.[80][93] On August 26, the Red Army left Vilnius and Lithuanians prepared to defend their borders. As Poland did not recognize the treaty, this led to further hostilities. Eventually, Lithuania lost the Vilnius Region to Poland during the Żeligowski's Mutiny. When mediation by the League of Nations failed to change the situation, Lithuania and Poland were suspended in the state of ""no war, no peace"" until the Polish ultimatum of 1938.[94] During all this time, Soviet Russia became Lithuania's strongest ally against Poland.[95]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian–Soviet_War
Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,"The sejm (Lithuanian: Seimas, Ruthenian: Соймъ, Polish: Sejm) was an early parliament in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was active from 1445 to 1569, when it was officially abolished by the Union of Lublin.[1] The Sejm was an irregular gathering of the Lithuanian nobility, called as needed by the Grand Duke or during an interregnum by the Lithuanian Council of Lords (an early government). The meetings would usually last one or two weeks. Sejm gradually evolved from a meeting of the most powerful magnates to a full legislative institution representing all of the nobility.[2] The Sejm was not the main political player as it was overshadowed by the Council of Lords. The Union of Lublin created a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and joined the Sejm of Lithuania with Sejm of Poland into one Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, the Sejm continued to convene under the name of Lithuanian Convocation. In total there were 40 Sejm and 37 Convocations.[1]

The first traces of large nobility meetings can be found in the Treaty of Salynas of 1398 and the Union of Horodło of 1413. It is considered that the first Sejm met in Hrodna in 1445 during talks between Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Council of Lords.[1] Soon influence of the nobility grew as Casimir's privileges released veldamas, dependent peasants, from their taxes to the state. That meant a significant increase in nobility's revenue. As the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars raged the country almost continuously between 1492 and 1582, the Grand Duke needed more tax revenues to finance the army and had to call the Sejm more frequently.[1] In exchange for cooperation, the nobility demanded various privileges, including strengthening of the Sejm.

At first the Sejm did not have the legislative power. It would debate on foreign and domestic affairs, taxes, wars, state budget.[1] At the beginning of the 16th century, the Sejm acquired some legislative powers. The Sejm could petition the Grand Duke to pass certain laws.[1] The Duke usually granted the request as he needed nobility's support and cooperation. At first members of the Sejm were members of the Council of Lords and high state officials. Only gradually all interested nobles could attend the meetings.[2] No invitation was necessary to attend.[1] As the importance of Sejm grew, nobles from more distant regions started electing representatives from their districts and sending them to the meeting. However, the Sejm was dominated by the magnates as they were much more politically active and lesser nobles were more passive observers.[3] However, gradually the lesser nobles understood that the Sejm gave them power to block new taxes and by mid-16th century they started to demand more privileges for themselves. Thus the Sejm shifted from magnate-controlled political tool to a representation of all nobles.[3] This shift was influenced by a similar movement in Poland.

Major reforms were carried out between 1564 and 1566, just before the Union of Lublin. According to the Second Statute of Lithuania, the Sejm acquired full legislative powers. It was composed of two houses: the upper house, called Senate, was the equivalent to the former Council of Lords and the lower house was made up of representatives of each district of the state.[1] No longer any member of the nobility could participate: each of the 28 powiats could send only two delegates.[2] It started a tradition of local Sejm (called seimelis) to elect the representatives.

When the separate Sejm for Lithuania was officially abolished in 1569, it adopted the name of Lithuanian Convocations and continued to meet until the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. It debated matters concerning the Grand Duchy of Lithuania or tried to establish a common position among Lithuanian delegates before departing for the Sejm of the Commonwealth.[1] The convocations retained basic structures (upper and lower houses) and procedures of the Sejm: each powiat could send only two representatives. Convocations were called by the Grand Duke, who also ratified its decisions and included them in official law books.[4]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejm_of_the_Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania
Republic of Central Lithuania,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Central_Lithuania
Lithuanian encyclopedias,"Lithuanian encyclopedias are encyclopedias published in the Lithuanian language or encyclopedias about Lithuania and Lithuania-related topics. The first known attempt to create a Lithuanian encyclopedia was in 1883, when Jonas Jacevičius failed to get permission from the Tsarist authorities for such a publication during the Lithuanian press ban (1866–1904). Several general Lithuanian encyclopedias were published afterwards: one in independent Lithuania in the 1930s (interrupted by World War II and never completed), two in the United States, three in the Lithuanian SSR, and one that was published in 2001–2015 in independent Lithuania. The content of the 25-volume Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija or VLE has been made available online.

The path to creating  the first Lithuanian encyclopedia, Lietuviškoji enciklopedija, was complicated. In 1910, Antanas Olšauskas, a Lithuanian emigrant in Chicago, Illinois, started to assemble an editorial team, but financial constraints and disagreements among the editors resulted in the abandonment of the project in 1912. After the declaration of independence of Lithuania in 1918, two initiatives were born in 1924. One, by the publishing house Švyturys, sought to publish a general encyclopedia; the other, by the publishing house Kultūra, in Šiauliai, sought to publish an encyclopedia dedicated to Lithuania and Lithuania-related topics. However, both initiatives failed due to financial hardships.

In 1929, Spaudos Fondas and Lithuanian Catholic Academy of Sciences separately initiated encyclopedic projects. They finally agreed to cooperate only in 1931, and the first booklet came out on October 1, 1931. Vaclovas Biržiška was appointed editor-in-chief. Many difficulties ensued, but the booklets finally began monthly publication, and approached the status of a periodic scientific journal. Twelve booklets would eventually be combined into one volume. The first volume, containing some 5,000 articles and 700 illustrations, appeared in 1933. Nine volumes were published—up to the letter J—and the tenth was underway when in 1944, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania, and its printing was halted. The encyclopedia was never completed.

The idea of a Lithuanian encyclopedia was revived in the United States by Lithuanian emigrants. Juozas Kapočius organized the editorial team and Vaclovas Biržiška again became the chief editor. Between 1953 and 1966, they published the 35-volume Lietuvių enciklopedija (often nicknamed the Boston Encyclopedia because it was published in Boston, Massachusetts) in the Lithuanian language. Two volumes of supplements and addenda were published in 1969 and in 1985. It is often believed that they were continuing the unfinished work of their first encyclopedia begun in their homeland. The undertaking was especially difficult because most of their materials and sources were left behind in Lithuania and were now unavailable—a result of the Iron Curtain. Between 1970 and 1978, the same group published the six-volume Encyclopedia Lituanica, an English-language encyclopedia on Lithuania and Lithuania-related topics. It remains the most comprehensive work on Lithuania in English.

In Lithuania, Soviet authorities printed a three-volume Concise Soviet Lithuanian Encyclopedia (Mažoji lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija) between 1966 and 1971; that is, after the Boston Encyclopedia was already completed. It covered only Lithuania-related topics. The 12-volume (plus one volume of supplements) Lietuviškoji tarybinė enciklopedija or LTE was published between 1976 and 1985. It is often called the ""Red Encyclopedia"" because of its distinct cover colors. It is still valuable for scientific topics, but the social science articles were distorted to conform to Soviet propaganda (for example, it portrayed western countries as bourgeois dictatorships). Much attention was given to Marxism-Leninism and the Communist Party, while many ""inconvenient"" topics from the Lithuanian history, such as the Lithuanian partisans, were entirely skipped. Between 1985 and 1988, the four-volume Tarybų Lietuvos enciklopedia or TLE, dealing with only Lithuania-related topics, was published. It closely followed the lead of LTE. Its last volume displayed signs of the intellectual freedom that arose in the 1980s during the Glasnost movement in Russia and the Sąjūdis movement in Lithuania.

In 2001, the Science and Encyclopaedia Publishing Institute, based in Vilnius, began the publication of the 25-volume Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija or VLE. The last volume was published in 2014 followed by a volume of supplements in 2015. Each of volume contains about 800 pages. In total, the encyclopedia contains 121,804 articles written by 2,957 authors, 25,120 illustrations, and 656 maps. About 21% of the articles is devoted to Lithuanian matters, particularly to those that were censored and repressed during the Soviet era. In 2017, the content of the encyclopedia was made available online.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_encyclopedias

Szymon Marcin Kossakowski,"Szymon Marcin Kossakowski (Lithuanian: Simonas Martynas Kosakovskis; 1741 in Šilai, Jonava – 1794) was a Polish–Lithuanian nobleman (szlachcic), and one of the leaders of the Targowica Confederation. In 1793, he became the last Grand Hetman of Lithuania.

He participated in the Radom Confederation and the Bar Confederation. He was known as a supporter of the Russian Empire during the Kościuszko Uprising and earlier, he was deemed a traitor. In the aftermath of the Vilnius Uprising, he was captured and hanged[1] in the town hall square of Vilnius with the inscription of He who swings will not drown and was buried in the cellars of the church in Jonava.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marcin_Kossakowski
2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election,"Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 9 and 23 October 2016 to elect the 141 members of the Seimas.[1] 71 were elected in single-member constituencies using the two-round system, and the remaining 70 in a single nationwide constituency using proportional representation. The first round was held on 9 October and the second round on 23 October.

The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union emerged as the largest party with 22% of the popular vote and 54 seats, up from just 4% and a single seat in the previous elections in 2012. The success of the party was attributed to voter dissatisfaction with established parties in light of low wages and persistent emigration. Homeland Union, the largest opposition party in the preceding Seimas, finished a distant second with 31 seats, though winning a slightly larger share of the national vote.

The parties of the outgoing government suffered major losses, falling from 78 seats to 28. The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, which had been the largest party prior to the elections, lost over half its seats and finished in third place with 17. Their coalition partner the Labour Party fared even worse, falling from 29 seats to just 2. Order and Justice won 8 seats, down from 11.

The 2012 parliamentary elections were held on 14 October 2012, with the run-off on 28 October. The elections were won by the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, which took 38 seats in the 141-member Eleventh Seimas.[2] Social Democrats were joined in the coalition government by Labour, Order and Justice and the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania. The Polish party withdrew from the government in 2014.[3]

The resulting government was headed by the leader of the Social Democrats, Algirdas Butkevičius, as the Prime Minister.

The Seimas has 141 members, elected to a four-year term in parallel voting, with 71 members elected in single-member constituencies and 70 members elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency.[4] Voting in the elections is open to all citizens of Lithuania who are at least 18-years-old.

Members of the Seimas from the 71 single-member constituencies are elected by a majority vote. A candidate is elected in the first round by obtaining an absolute majority of all votes cast (including blank/invalid votes) in given constituency and turnout there is at least 40%. If these criteria are not fulfilled, a run-off between the two highest-placed candidates is held within 15 days. In the second round, the candidate who obtains the most votes is elected (an absolute majority is not required), but if turnout in a given constituency is under 40% again, the whole election process there is repeated.[4]

The remaining 70 seats are allocated to the participating political parties using the largest remainder method. In the nationwide constituency, party lists need to receive at least 5% (7% for multi-party electoral lists) of the total votes cast (including blank/invalid votes) to be eligible for a seat (irrespective of the number of seats gained in single-member constituencies). Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the elections and adjusted by preference votes given by the voters.[4]

To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 25 years old on the election day, not under allegiance to a foreign state and permanently resident in Lithuania. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the elections are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election.[4] In addition, a person who has been removed from office through impeachment may not be elected.[5]

The 71 single-seat constituencies in Lithuania were drawn in 1992, based on the principle that the number of voters in each constituency should be between 90 and 110 percent of the average number of voters per constituency. As the demographic situation changed, the Seimas Elections' Act was amended to allow a deviation in the range from 80 and 120 percent, in order to avoid major changes to constituency boundaries.

In October 2015, the Constitutional Court of Lithuania decided that the existing system, which allows the largest constituency to be as much as 50% larger than the smallest one, is unconstitutional, since it does not give sufficiently equal weight to all votes. The court stated that the constituencies should be redrawn in such a way that the number of voters in each constituency is between 90 and 110 percent of the average.[6]

The decision of the Constitutional Court was implemented in December 2015, when the new constituencies were announced. Major changes included two additional constituencies in Vilnius.[7][8]

On 7 April 2016 the President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaitė, officially announced 9 October 2016 as the election date. The announcement, which came into effect on 9 April 2016, launched the election campaign, allowing the potential participants to register for the elections, raise funds and campaign in public.[31]

In January 2016, the Central Electoral Commission announced the spending limits for political campaigns in 2016. A party participating in the elections in the nationwide constituency could spend a total of 770 thousand euros on the campaign. Participants in the election races in single-seat constituencies could spend between 18 and 22 thousand euros, depending on the size of the constituency. As a result, a political party with candidates in every single-seat constituency could spend just over 2.2 million euros on its election campaign.[32]

Only citizens of Lithuania could contribute financially to the election campaigns. Each citizen could contribute up to 7,570 euros to a candidate, as long as their total contributions during the year did not exceed 10% of their stated annual income. A candidate could contribute up to 15,140 euros to their own election campaign.[33]

23 political parties were eligible to participate in the elections, having submitted their membership rolls before 1 March 2016, in compliance with legal requirements.[34] 16 political parties registered for the elections before the deadline on 5 August 2016. 12 of them participated in the elections independently, while the remaining 4 formed two separate electoral coalitions, bringing the total number of electoral lists to 14, down from 18 in 2012.[35][36] The electoral lists were assigned numbers in a random draw on 25 August.[37]

Over the year preceding the elections, six political parties consistently polled above the 5 percent threshold for seats in the nationwide constituency: Social Democrats, Homeland Union, Liberal Movement, Farmers and Greens Union, Labour, and Order and Justice.

After their election victory in 2012, the Social Democrats led the governing coalition, with Algirdas Butkevičius as Prime Minister. Butkevičius, his government and the Social Democrats maintained very high approval ratings among the public and performed well in the elections to the European parliament in 2014 (where they finished a close second) and the municipal elections in 2015 (where they won the most mandates and mayoral posts).[38] Their ratings suffered in 2016, damaged by a corruption scandal related to construction in protected areas near Druskininkai, but the Social Democrats remained the most popular party according to opinion polls.[39][40][41][42] The electoral program of the party was focused on spreading the benefits of the growing economy by increasing salaries and retirement benefits.[43]

Homeland Union was the largest opposition party in the Eleventh Seimas. Andrius Kubilius, who had led the first government in modern Lithuanian history to survive a full term in office, did not seek another term as leader of the party. In 2015 he was replaced by Gabrielius Landsbergis, the grandson of the patriarch of the party, Vytautas Landsbergis.[44] The party surprised political observers by winning the largest share of the vote in the European Parliament elections in 2014 and tended to outperform the opinion polls due to the higher participation rate among their supporters.[45] The program of the party promised higher quality public services and reduced bureaucratic waste, new well-paid employment opportunities and improved public education.[46]

The Liberal Movement had emerged as one of the main political forces in Lithuania, finishing a close third in the European Parliament elections in 2014 and the municipal elections in 2015. Until May 2016, the party was consistently the second most popular party in opinion polls (behind only the Social Democrats) and was seen as the most likely coalition partner for both the Social Democrats and Homeland Union.[45][47] The party lost most of its support after its leader, Eligijus Masiulis, was accused of taking a substantial bribe from one of the leading business groups in the country.[48][49] Masiulis promptly resigned and was eventually replaced by the mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Šimašius.[50] As part of its platform, the party proposed a smaller government, lower taxes (especially VAT) and more flexible labor relationships. The party also expressed support for same-sex unions in Lithuania.[51]

Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union rebranded itself as the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (LVŽS) in 2012. Led by businessman Ramūnas Karbauskis, the party received 6.6% of the vote in the European Parliament elections in 2014, earning a single mandate, and emerged as a dark horse in the electoral race in the spring of 2016. The rise of LVŽS was attributed to the popularity of Karbauskis, who had been active in campaigning against alcohol, and their lack of involvement in political scandals.[26] LVŽS was further boosted by the announcement that Saulius Skvernelis, a Minister of Interior in Butkevičius Cabinet and one of the most popular politicians in Lithuania, would head the party's electoral list in the elections, without joining the party.[52][53] Before the elections, the party ruled out the possibility of participating in a ruling coalition which involved Labour or Order and Justice.

The Labour Party was led in the elections by Valentinas Mazuronis, an MEP who had originally been elected to the European Parliament on the electoral list of Order and Justice. Labour was the second-largest party in Lithuania in terms of members, but had been plagued by accusations of fraudulent bookkeeping, and by the departure of its founder Viktor Uspaskich. Before the elections, the party promised to fight the influx of refugees into the country, despite the number of refugees actually settled in Lithuania being in single digits.[54] The party also proposed higher pensions and minimum wage, a higher non-taxable allowance, reduced VAT rates on food and medicine and one-off payouts to those reaching the age of maturity.[46]

Order and Justice, led by the former President of Lithuania Rolandas Paksas, was also involved in a corruption scandal before the elections. Paksas, who is barred from being elected to the Seimas, was suspected of accepting a bribe from Gedvydas Vainauskas, a media magnate, in exchange for favors related to construction permits.[45] The party proposed to link salaries and pensions to an inflation index, to exempt reinvested profits from corporate income taxes and to create new employment opportunities. Generous payments on childbirth were proposed to address demographic issues.[46]

In total, 1416 candidates competed for Seimas seats in the elections, with 673 participating in the electoral races in single-seat constituencies.[55]

As before every elections, televised debates took place on the national television channel. The debates took place over 4 weeks from 13 September to 6 October. Representatives from the 14 electoral lists were split into three groups for each week of debates, debating on different days of the week on the same topic. The topics for the four weeks of debates were: economy, demographics, justice and social policy.[56] The parties were mostly represented by the leaders of their electoral lists, with support from other members.

In May 2016, five political parties (the Social Democrats, the Liberal Movement, the Homeland Union, Labour and the Farmers and Greens Union) agreed to participate in the debates together, leaving out Order and Justice.[57] The agreement remained in place even after the corruption scandal involving the leader of the Liberal Movement, Eligijus Masiulis, and the subsequent slide in the party's ratings.[58]

The main party debate on economy took place on 14 September 2016. Prime Minister Butkevičius and Gabrielius Landsbergis of the Homeland Union clashed over the responsibility for the high poverty rate, while all parties identified what they saw as the main issues facing the economy. Kęstutis Daukšys of the Labour Party reiterated the promise from the party's electoral program to increase the salaries and pensions while Saulius Skvernelis, representing the Farmers and Greens Union, labeled such promises as populism and proposed to remove it from political decision making by indexing the minimum wage and pensions to economic indicators. At the same time Skvernelis proposed and Landsbergis supported reforms to the system of personal taxation, while Eugenijus Gentvilas of the Liberal Movement proposed wide-ranging tax cuts, having asserted that high taxes are one of the main stumbling blocks for economic progress in the country.[59] Experts polled by the National Television judged the debates as a marginal victory for Butkevičius and Social Democrats.[60]

The main party debate on demographics took place on 22 September 2016. Butkevičius defended the Social Democrats' record in government, which was attacked by the Homeland Union. All parties proposed reforms to the education sector and other measures they see as necessary to reverse the emigration trends. Experts polled by the National Television judged the debates as a marginal victory for Homeland Union, represented by Landsbergis, with Farmers and Greens, represented by Skvernelis, in a close second place. An improved performance from Skvernelis, compared to the first debate, was noted.[61]

The main party debate on justice took place on 29 September 2016. Experts polled by the National Television judged the debates as a marginal victory for Farmers and Greens, represented by Skvernelis, closely followed by the Homeland Union. Social Democrats, on the other hand, were criticized for failing to propose new ideas, instead of pointing out how situation was already improving.[62]

The main party debate on social policy took place on 6 October 2016. Candidates presented their positions on social issues and health. At the end of the debate the representatives gave their final statements to voters. Experts polled by the National Television criticized the lack of substantial proposals for reforms in the debate, but judged Farmers and Greens to have performed most convincingly. Homeland Union again finished close second, with Landsbergis' final speech considered as the most successful.[63]

The election was a surprise victory for Farmers and Greens Union, which won 54 seats in the parliament, after failing to clear the electoral threshold of 5% and winning just one seat in the preceding elections. Including the two candidates that won their single-member constituencies as independents but ran on the party's electoral list in the nationwide constituency, this represented the largest tally by any party in Lithuania in 20 years.[64] Analysts attributed the victory to the desire by the electorate to see new faces in the parliament, in light of low wages and rampant emigration.[65][66]

Homeland Union won the largest share of the vote (22.63%) and 20 mandates in the nationwide constituency, improving on their result from 2012. However, a disappointing performance in single-member constituencies, where they picked up only 11 seats, left the party a distant second with 31 seats, two fewer than in the previous elections.

Government parties suffered a major setback in the elections. Social Democrats, who had been leading the polls consistently since the previous elections, finished third with 15.04% of the vote and 17 seats. Order and Justice finished with 5.72% and 8 seats (down from 7.63% and 11 seats), while Labour Party, which had led the popular vote in the elections of 2012, failed to clear the electoral threshold for proportionally allocated seats and picked up only two seats in single-member constituencies. The failure of government parties has been attributed to sluggish economic growth, scandals that had surfaced over the months preceding the elections and the adoption of a new labour code that was deeply unpopular with voters.[67][68][69]

Algirdas Butkevičius, who was serving as the Prime Minister, lost single-member constituency that he had held since 1996.

Alongside votes for a party, voters were able to cast a preferential votes for a candidate on the party list.

Soon after the results of the first round of voting were clear, Mazuronis resigned as the leader of the Labour Party, while Paksas resigned as the leader of Order and Justice.[70][71] After the second round of voting, Butkevičius also offered his resignation as the chairman of the Social Democrats, but his resignation was rejected. However, Butkevičius ruled out standing for reelection as the chairman in 2017.[72] Landsbergis announced new leadership election in the Homeland Union in early 2017.

Soon after the election results became clear, the victorious Farmers and Greens started coalition consultations with Homeland Union and the Social Democrats.[73] Farmers and Greens expressed their desire for a broad coalition involving both parties, a concept that Homeland Union ruled out. On 9 November, Farmers and Greens signed a coalition agreement with the Social Democrats, under which the Social Democrats would be allocated 3 of the 14 seats in the cabinet, while Farmers and Greens got the right to nominate the prime minister and the speaker of the Seimas.[74]

The newly elected Twelfth Seimas convened for its first session on 14 November 2016 and elected Viktoras Pranckietis as the Speaker of the Seimas.[75] On 22 November, President Dalia Grybauskaitė appointed Saulius Skvernelis as the prime minister.[76]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Lithuanian_parliamentary_election
First Seimas,"First Seimas of Lithuania was the first parliament (Seimas) democratically elected in Lithuania after it declared independence on February 16, 1918.

The elections took place on October 10–11, 1922, to replace the Constituent Assembly, which adopted the final constitution on August 1, 1922. The Seimas elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the President of Lithuania and Ernestas Galvanauskas, as the new Prime Minister, was entrusted to form a new cabinet of ministers. However, no coalition could muster a majority and the Seimas was in a deadlock: Galvanauskas formed two cabinets, and both got 38 votes for and against. As the Seimas could not continue in such manner, it was dissolved on March 12, 1923. New elections were held in May.

The Seimas was faced with two major international issues: negotiation over the Vilnius Region and the Klaipėda Region. On November 20, 1922, the Seimas authorized Klaipėda Revolt, which started in January. Klaipėda became autonomous region of Lithuania. On March 15, 1923, in part reacting to the January revolt the Conference of Ambassadors confirmed a new demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania and western powers considered Vilnius dispute settled despite Lithuanian protests.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Seimas
Slavery in Lithuania,"The Third Statute of Lithuania abolished slavery in 1588.[1] Serfdom or baudžiava (Lithuanian for 'to punish') which is, in turn, derived from Lithuanian  bausmė (punishment) on the territory of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, continued to exist throughout Rzeczpospolita period and later under the rule of Russian empire until Emancipation reform of 1861.

From the 14th century onward (about the same time ethnic Lithuania was converted from paganism to Christianity), the feudal system had been imposed on the vast majority of the population, mainly by Polish nobles, who along with Polish clergy, imposed Christianity on the Baltic tribes. In the second half of the 16th century, the Volok Reform has destroyed the remnants of peasant land ownership, consolidated its feudal monopoly, separated the classes of nobles and peasants (serfs); peasant land became the property of the grand duke. Peasants turned into serfs made up more than 1/2 of all Lithuanian peasants.[2] The landowners in Lithuania at that time were often foreigners – Polish, German, Russian, and some Polonized or Russianized Lithuanians. Polish language and culture became high culture, subordinating Lithuanian language and culture much as ethnic Lithuanians were subordinated by feudal bondage or serfdom. Serfdom was, by definition, a form of land bondage: essentially, slavery to the feudal noble in the form of unpaid labor on the lands of his estate. Serfs were legally bonded to the land, so whoever owned the land ""owned"" them. Such bondage continued generation after generation, with serfs subject to whipping, even torture or murder, at the whim of nobles and their estate managers.[3]

During the 18th century in the last third of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the process of modernization of society began. On 3 May 1791 that trend was reflected in the adopted constitution, but further spontaneous development was stopped by the conquerors and Third Partition of 1795.[4] In 1795, after the annexation of Lithuania (without Užnemunė and Klaipėda region) to Russia, serfdom became harsher. Peasants began to be sold without land. Peasants had to perform the heavy duty of Rekrut. In Western Europe. serfs, unlike slaves, could not be bought, sold, or traded individually though they could, depending on the area, be sold together with land. Serfs in Eastern Europe or kholop as called in Russia, by contrast, could be traded like regular slaves, could be abused with no rights over their own bodies, could not leave the land they were bound to, and could marry only with their lord's permission.[5] Government officials spoke only Russian. After unsuccessful Lithuanian uprisings against the Russians in 1830 and 1831,[6] whose activists were executed or exiled to Siberia: ""The rebels' landholdings were parceled out to court favorites and other Russians in a far-reaching colonization process that led to a large Russian influx"".[7]

Lithuanian serfs were not freed until a decree by the Russian czar in 1861. But that declaration, much like the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation in the US, was not accompanied by land reform. In short, freed Lithuanian serfs were not granted their own version of ""40 acres and a mule"", so their only resort, if remaining in Lithuania, was to continue to work on post-feudal estates for starvation wages, and to largely remain subject to the rough ""justice"" of still powerful, neo-feudal lords. Available education to Lithuanians was limited – books and newspapers in Lithuanian language were prohibited due to Lithuanian press ban from 1864 until 1904[8] as a form of repression after unsuccessful January Uprising.

In 1918, after much struggle and First World War, Lithuanians had opportunity to gain independence. Act of Independence of Lithuania was signed by the Council of Lithuania on February 16, 1918, proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of Lithuania, governed by democratic principles, with Vilnius as its capital. This was the first time in several hundred years that Lithuanians had a free choice of occupations and began entering trades, professions, and commerce.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Lithuania
Jonas Basanavičius,"Jonas Basanavičius (pronunciationⓘ, Polish: Jan Basanowicz; 23 November 1851 – 16 February 1927) was an activist and proponent of the Lithuanian National Revival. He participated in every major event leading to the independent Lithuanian state and is often given the informal honorific title of the ""Patriarch of the Nation"" (Lithuanian: tautos patriarchas) for his contributions.

Born to a family of farmers, Basanavičius was to become a priest but instead chose to study medicine at the Moscow Medical Academy. He worked as a doctor from 1880 to 1905 in the Principality of Bulgaria. Despite the long distance, he dedicated substantial effort to the Lithuanian cultural work. He founded the first Lithuanian-language newspaper Aušra (1883), contributed articles on Lithuania to the press, collected samples of Lithuanian folklore (songs, fairy-tales, legends, riddles, etc.) and published them. He was also involved with local Bulgarian politics. He returned to Lithuania in 1905 and immediately joined Lithuanian cultural life. He became chairman of the organizing committee of the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius. In 1907, he founded the Lithuanian Scientific Society, a learned society dedicated to Lithuanian history, ethnography, linguistics. Basanavičius became chairman of the society and dedicated the rest of his life to its affairs. In 1917, he was elected by the Vilnius Conference to the Council of Lithuania. He chaired the council's session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918 and was the first to sign it. In the aftermath of World War I, Vilnius changed hands and regimes several times, but Basanavičius refused to leave, safeguarding the city's museums, libraries and archives, and continuing his lifelong research of Lithuanian cultural matters. After Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, Vilnius became part of Poland and Lithuanian activities were censored and limited. Basanavičius' continued presence in the city became a symbol of Lithuanian claims to the bitterly contested Vilnius Region. When he died in 1927, the Lithuanian government declared a five-day mourning period.

Basanavičius was born in the village of Ožkabaliai (Polish: Oszkobole) in the Augustów Governorate of Congress Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire, to a family of Lithuanian farmers. His younger brother Vincas was born in 1861; other children died in childhood. Birth complications prompted his parents, devout Catholics, to pray and promise that they would educate their firstborn to be a priest. Keeping up with the promise, the parents supported a village tutor for local children. There Basanavičius learned basic reading, writing, and arithmetic as well as serving the altar. He further attended an elementary school in Lukšiai. During that time Polish was regarded as the more prestigious language of the nobility and well educated people. Russian was used in state administration, while Lithuanian was used among the peasants. After the Uprising of 1863, Tsarist authorities implemented various Russification policies in an attempt to reduce the influence of Polish language and culture. One of such policies allowed Basanavičius to attend Marijampolė Gymnasium. Before the uprising, a son of a Lithuanian could hardly expect to be admitted to a school catering to Polish nobility. Basanavičius failed his first entrance examinations in 1865, but succeeded a year later.

Basanavičius developed appreciation for the Lithuanian language, culture, and history from local hill forts and his parents, who provided a loving treasure of local songs, legends, stories. This appreciation grew and deepened at the gymnasium where Basanavičius got acquainted with classical authors of Lithuanian history (Maciej Stryjkowski, Alexander Guagnini, Jan Długosz, Marcin Kromer), studied Lithuanian folk songs, read classical poems The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis, Konrad Wallenrod by Adam Mickiewicz, Margier by Władysław Syrokomla, and historical fiction by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski. In 1883, he wrote in Aušra:

But who, we ask, composed all these songs about Lithuania's past, which made famous the name of Polish poetry in Europe? The answer is short: Lithuanians! Adomas Mickevičius, L. Kondratavičius, J. I. Kraševskis, T. Lenartavičius, Kotkis (Chodźko), Adinčius (Odyniec), Asnikis and many other lesser bards had Lithuanian surnames, are Lithuanians, come from Lithuania and Lithuanian blood is pulsating through their veins. If they wrote about the past of their loved Lithuania in a non-Lithuanian language, the Polish influence in Lithuanian affairs is to blame.[2]

He drifted away from religion after reading a critical essay of Life of Jesus by Ernest Renan. Upon graduation in 1873, he managed to persuade his parents to allow him to attend Moscow University and not to send him to the Sejny Priest Seminary.

Basanavičius traveled to Moscow first to study history and philology, but after two semesters he transferred to the Moscow Medical Academy. Again, he benefited from the post-uprising Russification policies. He received one of ten fellowships (360 rubles annually) established for Lithuanian students from Congress Poland. He also supplemented his income by taking up private tutoring, but the living conditions were harsh and that had a lasting impact on his health. Basanavičius actively participated in student affairs, followed developments in Lithuania, and continued his studies of Lithuanian heritage. Collecting data from Rumyantsev and university libraries, he hoped to write a study on Grand Duke Kęstutis. He usually spent his summers in Lithuania, collecting folk songs, fairytales, riddles.

After his graduation in spring 1879, Basanavičius traveled back to Lithuania and had a few patients in Ožkabaliai, Vilkaviškis and Aleksotas. He returned to Moscow in October 1879 hoping to establish his private practice, but soon he accepted a lucrative proposal from the Principality of Bulgaria to become the head of a hospital in Lom Palanka, a town of about 8,000 inhabitants. After arrival in late January 1880, he found a run-down hospital located in a former hotel and energetically took measures to construct a new building, establish outpatient service, and combat perception that the hospital was a place to die rather than to get well. In 1880, the hospital had 522 inpatients and 1,144 outpatients compared to just 19 patients during 1879. The position paid well, expenses were low, so he was able to quickly repay debts and accumulate savings. Basanavičius also wrote medical research articles, liberal political articles supporting Bulgarian politician Petko Karavelov, and cultural articles for Prussian Lithuanian press, including Tilžės Keleivis and Lietuwißka Ceitunga, and academic journal Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft. However, these publications were too much under German control and did not satisfy growing needs of Lithuanian activists. Basanavičius contemplated establishing a truly Lithuanian newspaper.

After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in March 1881, Bulgarian Prince Alexander of Battenberg attempted to crack down on liberal politicians. Afraid of persecution, Basanavičius left Bulgaria in May 1882. He traveled for several months, visiting Belgrade, Vienna, Lithuania, before settling down in Prague in December 1882. There he organized publication of Aušra, the first Lithuanian-language newspaper. The first issue appeared in March 1883 and is often cited as the beginning of the Lithuanian National Revival. Basanavičius directed the editorial policies, while Jurgis Mikšas handled printing in Ragnit in East Prussia. The newspaper then would be smuggled to Lithuania as publication in the Lithuanian language was illegal in the Russian Empire. Basanavičius soon lost editorial control of Aušra to Jonas Šliūpas. His involvement in an illegal publication prevented Basanavičius from returning to Lithuania until 1905.

In Prague, Basanavičius met Gabriela Eleonora Mohl, a Bohemian German, and they married in May 1884. Immediately after the wedding, the couple moved to Bulgaria, where political situation had improved. Basanavičius first found a position in Elena, but managed to return to Lom Palanka in 1885. Life there was marked by a series of hardships. The Serbo-Bulgarian War brought a wave of war casualties to the hospital and a typhus epidemic. Basanavičius became seriously ill with pneumonia and typhus in February 1886. In August 1887, he survived an assassination attempt, but one bullet remained logged under his left shoulder blade for the rest of his life and caused various health issues. His attacker, Alexander Manoilov, served a ten-year sentence but never fully explained his reasoning. On 16 February 1889, Mohl died of tuberculosis that she apparently contracted from her dying mother while still in Prague. The death of his wife sent Basanavičius into depression and melancholy for almost a year.

In 1891, Basanavičius acquired Bulgarian citizenship[3] and was promoted to Varna, a city of 25,000 residents, in 1892, but his health problems intensified. He suffered from arrhythmia, neurasthenia, neuralgia, paraesthesia. That prompted him to resign from public position in 1893 and limit his work to his private practice and palace visits to Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. When Nicholas II of Russia became the new Tsar in 1894, Basanavičius petitioned to be allowed to return to Lithuania but was refused. Basanavičius traveled to Austria several times searching for cures to his ailments. In 1900 he suffered a stroke and traveled to Vienna, where he had an X-ray taken which showed where the assassin's bullet was logged under the bones. Doctors refused to operate to extract it.

Despite his ailments, Basanavičius continued to work both on medical and ethnographic studies and even joined politics. In 1898, he was elected to the Bulgarian Literature Society. He traveled to East Prussia, where he campaigned on behalf of four Prussian Lithuanian candidates to the German Reichstag in the 1898 elections (Jonas Smalakys was elected). He also joined the Democratic Party and was elected to the Varna City Council from 1899 to 1903. He also participated in the party congresses and helped develop the party program on health care. However, his passion remained with Lithuanian language and culture. Despite the long distance, he collected Lithuanian tales and songs and published them in 1898–1905 in Lithuanian American presses in United States. Personally he thought that his most important work was the lifelong thesis that Lithuanians descended from Thracians and Phrygians and therefore were closely related to the Bulgarians. The thesis has not been accepted by other scholars.

Russia lost the Russo-Japanese War and became engulfed in the Revolution of 1905. In Lithuania, the press ban was lifted. Basanavičius, after years of service, was entitled to receive a Bulgarian pension and considered this a good time to return to Lithuania even though he did not have a permission to return. He departed Bulgaria in May 1905 and arrived to Vilnius in August. Immediately he joined activities of Lithuanian activists and promoted the idea of a Lithuanian assembly which would become the Great Seimas of Vilnius.[3] With help from the staff of Vilniaus žinios, a fifteen-member organizing committee was formed and Basanavičius became its chairman. In November 1905, in the name of the organizing committee Basanavičius authored a controversial memorandum to Sergei Witte, Prime Minister of the Russian Empire, which demanded autonomy for Lithuania in the Russian Empire.

Over 2,000 participants gathered on 4–5 December 1905 in Vilnius for the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Basanavičius was elected as its chairman. After loud, passionate, and intense discussions, the Seimas adopted a four-paragraph resolution which declared Tsarist government as Lithuania's most dangerous enemy and demanded autonomy for Lithuania. The resolution also called for passive and peaceful resistance to Tsarist authorities, such as not paying taxes, organizing strikes, boycotting certain products, etc. The autonomy was not achieved and the Tsarist authorities soon reestablished their control, but it laid the groundwork for establishing the independent Lithuanian republic in 1918. Using the energy generated by the Seimas, Basanavičius founded the Lithuanian National Democratic Party (Lithuanian: Tautiškoji lietuvių demokratų partija), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania but it did not gain more prominence.

As Tsarist authorities began investigating the Seimas and questioning its organizers, Basanavičius decided to leave Vilnius and traveled to Saint Petersburg. There he approached Pavel Milyukov, leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party, but found little sympathy for the Lithuanian cause. When he returned in January 1906, the police was waiting for him and he considered fleeing the country, but his Bulgarian passport was expired. The authorities questioned him, but he was not jailed. He managed to renew his passport and even obtain a one-year permit to reside in Russia. Despite his ailments and recurring health problems, Basanavičius wholeheartedly joined the election campaigns to the newly established State Duma of the Russian Empire, wrote extensively for Lithuanian press, campaigned for use of Lithuanian language in Catholic churches, continued his ethnographic research going through various archives and libraries. The issue of language in churches was particularly important to Basanavičius. When Russian authorities expelled Eduard von der Ropp, Bishop of Vilnius, from Vilnius, Basanavičius attempted to organize a delegation to Pope Pius X to convince the pope to replace Ropp with a Lithuanian bishop. That put Basanavičius in sharp conflict with Polish clergy. Basanavičius chaired a commission organizing the first exhibition of Lithuanian art, which was held in January 1907 at Vileišis Palace.

On 7 April 1907, Basanavičius, who contemplated establishing a learned society since the 1880s, formally opened the Lithuanian Scientific Society dedicated to studies of Lithuanian history and language. He was elected as the society's president and the society became the focus of his life. Basanavičius was involved to such a degree that the society was virtually identical with his person. The society published scholarly journal Lietuvių tauta (The Lithuanian Nation) which Basanavičius edited. The society also established a library, archive, and museum. The society was not welcomed by Tsarist authorities, that monitored and restricted its activities. Basanavičius campaigned for the National House, an official headquarters for the society. The society raised enough funds to buy a plot of land, but not enough to construct the house. The society and Basanavičius were criticized by younger scholars as too old-fashioned while Christian clergy attacked it for being too secular, but established new standards and levels of quality of Lithuanian scholarship.

The society organized exhibitions, two most prominent were in 1908 for the 25th anniversary of Aušra and in 1914 for the 10th anniversary of the end of the Lithuanian press ban. The society wanted to publish Lithuanian textbooks, but could not find competent authors for the books. It also planned on publishing a Lithuanian encyclopedia, but editorial disputes and financial difficulties derailed the project. The society established a four-member commission (members were Jonas Jablonskis, Kazimieras Būga, Juozas Balčikonis, and Jurgis Šlapelis) which was tasked with standardizing the Lithuanian language. After great debates, Joblonskis emerged as the leading linguist and his book on Lithuanian syntax was published by the society in 1911. The society actively campaigned against city plans to build a water tower on Gediminas Hill and further damage remains of the historic Vilnius Upper Castle; Basanavičius personally traveled to Saint Petersburg to petition the issue.

During its annual meeting in June 1913, the society decided to send a delegation to United States primarily to raise funds for the National House. It was decided that Basanavičius should go and that Martynas Yčas would accompany him.[4] Basanavičius hesitated, citing his health issues, but agreed.[5] They visited Lithuanian American communities on the East Coast (New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and elsewhere). They were discouraged by lax manners of the Lithuanians, infighting between local communities, and attacks by socialists (for example, Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas wrote to Lithuanian American socialist press urging to boycott the donation drive).[6] Basanavičius deeply resented such attacks as to him loyalty to one's nation far outweighed loyalty to one's class or political views.[7] In total, they visited 84 Lithuanian communities in 120 days and collected $23,799 from some 6,000 donors.[8] The money was not enough to build the National House and it was lost in a Russian bank during World War I.[9]

The exhausting travel schedule further deteriorated Basanavičius' frail health. Observers agreed that he became a lot more passive, more an observer than an active participant. Basanavičius himself recognized that he had trouble speaking, remembering things, was overall weaker.[10] He continued to join various committees and organizations, but he would not automatically become chairman. It seemed that his membership was in honor of his past services rather than in expectation of future accomplishments.[11]

At the outbreak of World War I, Basanavičius was undergoing bladder treatment in Berlin and rushed to Vilnius before the borders closed. He spent the war in Vilnius trying to preserve and protect the holdings of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and organize refugee relief efforts via the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In September 1915, Germans took over Vilnius. Many Lithuanians evacuated deeper into Russia, but Basanavičius remained in the city. Initially, the Ober Ost officials restricted Lithuanian activities and banned their press but became more lenient as the war progressed. Basanavičius concerned himself with the cultural work; for example, he obtained new premises for the library of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in summer 1917 and defended Lithuanian priests who spoke against political activities of Kazimierz Mikołaj Michalkiewicz [pl], administrator of the Vilnius Diocese.[12]

The Germans established the puppet Kingdom of Poland and Basanavičius co-signed several memorandums to German officials informing them of Lithuanian aspirations. He participated in the Vilnius Conference and was elected to the 20-member Council of Lithuania, but his role was more honorary and ceremonial. He formally presented thanks to the German officials for allowing the conference and sent a letter to Pope Benedict XV, but was not one of the active officers of the proceedings.[13] On 11 December 1917, the council adopted an act that was demanded by German Chancellor Georg von Hertling and that called for ""a firm and perpetual bond of alliance"" with Germany.[14] Such concessions to the Germans created a rift in the council and four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the council in protest.[15] Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of 11 December, temporarily stepped down and Basanavičius chaired the session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918.[15] He was the first to sign the Act.[13]

Between January 1919 and October 1920, Vilnius changed hands and political regimes several times, but Basanavičius was little concerned with political turmoil and concentrated on cultural work. He worked with the communist regime of the short-lived Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, particularly the Commissar of Education Vaclovas Biržiška, to obtain funds for the repairs of the history museum.[16] After the city was captured by the Poles in April 1919, Polish officials harassed Lithuanian activists, confiscated the money advanced by the Soviets for the museum, raided premises of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in search for weapons, etc. Basanavičius organized lectures, helped with Lithuanian schools, and continued his cultural research.[17] Balancing between Lithuanian and Polish interests, he refused to participate in the opening of the Stefan Batory University.[18] In early 1920, he once again had to relocate the Lithuanian Scientific Society as the premises granted by the German authorities were returned to previous owners.[19]

In May 1920, Basanavičius together with Mykolas Biržiška, Kristupas Čibiras [lt], and Teofilius Juodvalkis traveled to Kaunas to attend the opening of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania.[19] Basanavičius was greeted as an honored guest and met with many dignitaries and old friends. He also visited the native Ožkabaliai before returning to Vilnius in early June.[20] A month later, in July 1920, the city was captured by the Soviet Union and it was transferred to the Lithuanians according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. But Poland recaptured the city in October 1920 during the staged Żeligowski's Mutiny.[21] Polish authorities limited the membership in the Lithuanian Scientific Society only to the residents of Poland.[22] Polish censorship and restrictions caused great anxiety to Basanavičius who feared that he might get arrested.[23] His refusal to leave the city became a living symbol of the Lithuanian claims to the city.[24] In July–November 1924, Basanavičius again visited Lithuania and received a hero's welcome.[25] On 23 November, a day-long celebration with a special mass, concerts, and lectures for his 75th birthday was held in Kaunas.[26]

Basanavičius fell in his home on 5 February 1927. He refused to go to a hospital until he completed certain writing. At the hospital of the Lithuanian Sanitary Aid Society, he was diagnosed with bladder and lung infections that his body was failing to fight.[27] On 16 February 1927, the 9th anniversary of Lithuania's independence, he discussed matters of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and expressed wishes to attend the independence celebrations.[28] He died that day at 6:50 pm. The Lithuanian government declared five-day mourning and sent a 12-member delegation to his funeral.[27]

Due to the tense relations between the two countries, Poland's approval was uncertain. Despite these concerns, the Polish authorities did not impose any obstacles.[29] The Lithuanian delegation did not travel through Riga, as had been customary for journeys between the two countries, but instead crossed a usually closed border. The Lithuanians arrived at the border station of Zawiasy (now Lazdėnai), where a specially arranged first-class train awaited to transport them to Vilnius.[30] There, they were welcomed by members of the Lithuanian community, Danielius Alseika and Jurgis Šlapelis. Moreover, any Lithuanian citizen who wished to attend the funeral and arrived at the border was also to be allowed entry into Poland.[29]

The Lithuanian delegation included representatives of academia, culture, and politics. Among them were: Mykolas Biržiška, Kazimieras Jokantas, Steponas Kairys, Jonas Vileišis, Fr. Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, Izidorius Tamošaitis, Zigmas Žemaitis, Augustinas Janulaitis, Antanas Sodeika, Vladislava Grigaitienė-Polovinskaitė, and the Bishop of Kaišiadorys, Juozapas Kukta.[30]

Due to the arrival of the Lithuanian delegation, the funeral was postponed to February 21. At 6:00 p.m. on February 20, the body of Basanavičius was transported from the Lithuanian Sanitary Aid Society Clinic to the Vilnius Cathedral. The procession, led by Fr. Antanas Viskantas, passed along Wileńska and Adam Mickiewicz Streets (now Gediminas Avenue). It included not only Lithuanians but also Poles and representatives of other nationalities.[31] The following day at 10:00 a.m., a funeral mass was held at the cathedral, celebrated by the Vilnius Archbishop Romuald Jałbrzykowski. The sermon, delivered first in Lithuanian and then in Polish, was given by Lithuanian priest Petras Kraujalis.[31] The procession then proceeded to the Rassos Cemetery, where the burial took place at 1:30 p.m. Speeches were delivered in order by Danielius Alseika, Mykolas Biržiška, and Jonas Vileišis representing the Lithuanian side, followed by Bronisław Krzyżanowski and Ludwik Abramowicz on the Polish side. Fr. Adam Stankievič spoke on behalf of the Belarusians of Vilnius, and Zalman Reisen on behalf of the Jewish community.[32] After further speeches, the ceremony concluded. At 6:30 p.m., a commemorative event was held in the ""Kakadu"" hall at 5 Dąbrowski Street (now Jakšto Street).[33]

The Lithuanian delegation left Vilnius on February 23 on a specially arranged first-class train. Throughout the visit, both sides avoided political topics, resulting in a friendly and neighborly atmosphere. The domestic and international press viewed the event as a sign of improving relations between the two countries. However, these hopes proved unfounded, as the second half of the year saw a significant deterioration in Lithuanian–Polish relations.[34]

A street in Varna, Bulgaria was named Dr. Basanovich Street (Bulgarian: ул. Д-р Иван Басанович) in his honour. A memorial plaque on Panagyurishte Street, Varna, marks the location of former Basanavičius residence.[35] A memorial plaque was unveiled at Anglická 15, Vinohrady, Prague in December 2013.[36]

Jono Basanavičiaus Street in Palanga, the most popular and biggest summer resort in Lithuania, is named after Jonas Basanavičius, who visited Palanga personally in 1924.[37]

Basanavičius collected Lithuanian folklore, such as songs, fairy-tales, and riddles, and published 14 books during his life. In 1993–2004, folklorists Leonardas Sauka and Kostas Aleksynas organized approximately 7,000 works of folklore collected by Basanavičius and published them in the 15-volume Jonas Basanavičius Folklore Library.[38]

A prominent bust of Dr. Jonas Basanavicius is sited on the lowest level of the Lithuanian Cultural Garden within the Cleveland Cultural Gardens in Rockefeller Park in Cleveland, Ohio. Dedicated in 1936, the bust was a gift of the Lithuanian government. The bust is a copy of an original created by prominent Lithuanian sculptor Jonas Zikaras, whose work championed Lithuanian national identity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Basanavičius

Election sejm,"Election sejm (Polish: Sejm elekcyjny; Lithuanian: Elekcinis seimas) was one of three kinds of special general sejm in pre-partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Upon vacancy of the throne, the election sejm, meeting at Wola outside Warsaw, elected a new king.[1]

Any hereditary nobleman could vote in the Election Parliament, if present. Often close to 100,000 nobles came to those sejms.

The other two kinds of special sejm—likewise concerned with the filling of the throne—were the ""convocation sejm"" and the ""coronation sejm.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_sejm
Name of Lithuania,"The first known record of the name of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuva) was recorded in the Quedlinburg Chronicle (Latin: Annales Quedlinburgenses, written between 1008 and 1030) in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno.[1] The Chronicle recorded in the form Litua  (in the phrase ""in confinio Rusciæ et Lituæ a paganis capite plexus""). Although it is clear the name originated from a Baltic language,[2] scholars still debate the meaning of the word.[3]

During the 13th century the Duchy of Lithuania was bordered by Slavic lands. The Slavs did not create the name; they used the existing Lithuanian ethnonym.[3] The Lithuanian diphthong -ie- has, in Slavic languages, shifted to the vowel -i- (и), and the short -u- became extra-short (reduced) -ŭ- (ъ) which, being unstressed, later disappeared from the East Slavic, hence Litva. This is evidence that the Slavs borrowed this ethnonym from Lithuanians a long time ago.[4][3][vague]

During the next century, Lithuania's name was recorded in other languages, including German and Polish. In early German chronicles Lithuania's name was spelled Lettowen.[5][3] In this form the German letter -e- is used to denote the Lithuanian diphthong -ie-, while -owen denotes the Lithuanian hydronymic suffix -uva (-ava).[5][3] The traditional Lithuanian root -liet- is encountered in various German terms of the era, such as Lettowen, and in Latin as Lethovia, Lettovia, Lettavia, etc.[3] For example, after becoming the ruler of Lithuania, Grand Duke Algirdas appeared as the King of Lithuania (Latin: rex Letwinorum) in the Livonian Chronicles.[6][7]

In the Rus' chronicles,[which?] Lithuania's name was written as Литъва, alongside a shortened version, Литва (Litva), where -i- (и) was already used instead of the diphthong -ie.[3] All of these names clearly originated from *Lētuvā > Lietuva, forms used by Lithuanians to identify their lands.[4][3] The current form of the name Lietuva is thought to have been used by Lithuanians since the 12th or 13th century,[8] but there are no written sources of that time, as the oldest existing manuscript in the Lithuanian language is dated back to the 16th century. Despite ample historic and linguistic evidence with regard to the name's usage in different languages, there is a certain degree of debate about the etymology of the name.[3]

The regalia of Grand Duke Gediminas did not survive; however, it is known that in 1323 Gediminas sent 7 letters from his castle in Vilnius that also did not survive. Therefore, with them the Seal of Gediminas was also lost.[9] Nevertheless, the letter's content is known from a transcript as on 1 July 1323 notary (John of Bremen) in the city of Lübeck confirmed a transcript of a 26 May 1323 letter of Gediminas and also described in detail the oval waxy seal which was attached to the letter.[10][9] According to the notary's transcript, the oval Seal of Gediminas had a twelve corners edging, at the middle of the edging was an image of a man with long hair, who sat on a throne and held a crown (or a wreath) in his right hand and a sceptre in his left hand, moreover, a cross was engraved around the man along with a Latin inscription: S DEI GRACIA GEDEMINNI LETHWINOR ET RUTKENOR REG (English: Gediminas', by the grace of God, the King of the Lithuanians and the Rus' people, seal).[10][9][11] Authentic Jogaila's seal from 1382 has a Latin text: ✶ ia ‚ gal ✶ – dey ✶ gracia ✶ r – ex – in ✶ lettow (English: Jogaila, by the grace of God, King in Lithuania).[6]

Following the Union of Lublin, the Lithuanians and Grand Dukes of Lithuania also called the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the Lithuanian Republic and considered it a separate entity from the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.[12]

In a Lithuanian language panegyric to Sigismund III Vasa in 1589, the genitive case of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania is Lietuwos.[13] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania is referred to as dides Kunigiſtes Lietuwos in Lithuanian within a religious Christian book from 1653.[14]

There have been several attempts to associate Lietuva with Celtic toponyms, and with Latin or Italian words, but these attempts all lack strong linguistic support. According to a widespread popular belief, the word Lietuva (Lithuania) originated from the Lithuanian words lyti (to rain) and lietus (rain).[15][16][3] However, there is no serious scientific support for this theory. Since the word Lietuva has a suffix (-uva), the original word should have no suffix.[3] A likely candidate is Lietā.[3] Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms, linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms. Usually such names evolved through the following process: hydronym → toponym → ethnonym.[17][3]

A small river not far from Kernavė, the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the would-be Grand Duchy of Lithuania, is usually credited as the source of the name.[3] This river's original name is Lietava.[17][3] As time passed, the suffix -ava could have changed into -uva, as the two are from the same suffix branch.[3] The river flows in the lowlands and easily spills over its banks, therefore the traditional Lithuanian form liet- could be directly translated as lietis (to spill), of the root derived from the Proto-Indo-European *leyǝ-.[18][3] However, the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation. On the other hand, such a fact is not unprecedented in world history.[4]

While the word's etymology continues to be debated, scientists agree that the primary origins of the ethnonym were the Lithuanian forms *Lētuvā/Lietuva, which were then used by different languages, including Slavic.[3] It is very unlikely for the name to have derived from a Slavic language, since the Slavic -i- (и) could never be transliterated into the Lithuanian diphthong -ie-.[4][3]

Among other etymologies of the name of Lithuania is Artūras Dubonis's hypothesis,[19] that Lietuva relates to the word *leičiai (plural of leitis, a social group in the early Grand Duchy of Lithuania).[20][21][22][23][24][25] The word leičiai is still used as an ethnonym for Lithuanians, usually poetically or in historical contexts, in the Latvian language, which is closely related to Lithuanian.[25][23]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Lithuania
Outline of Lithuania,"The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Lithuania:

Lithuania – sovereign country located in the Baltic region of Northern Europe.[1][2] Situated along the south-eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, sharing borders with Latvia to the north, Belarus to the southeast, Poland, and the Russian exclave of the Kaliningrad Oblast to the southwest. Lithuania is a member of NATO, OECD and the European Union. Its population is about 2.8 million. The largest city and capital is Vilnius.

During the 14th century, Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, as present-day Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. With the Lublin Union of 1569 Poland and Lithuania formed a new state: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was finally destroyed by its neighboring countries in 1795. Most of Lithuania's territory was annexed by the Russian Empire, until the Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918, which declared the re-establishment of a sovereign state. Between 1940 and 1945 Lithuania was occupied by both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany at different times. When World War II was near its end in 1944 and the Nazis retreated, the Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first Baltic republic to declare its restored independence after 50 years of Soviet occupation.
Lithuania became a full member of the Schengen Agreement on 21 December 2007.[3] In 2009, Lithuania celebrated the millennium of its name.

The Lithuanians are a Baltic people closely related to the Latvians, with the Lithuanian language sharing many similarities to Latvian. Today the Latvians and Lithuanians are the only surviving members of the Baltic peoples and Baltic languages of the Indo-European family.

Hetman of Zaporizhian Cossacks,"A Hetman of Zaporizhian Cossacks is a historical term that has multiple meanings.

Officially the post was known as Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host (Ukrainian: Гетьман Війська Запорозького, romanized: Hetman Viiska Zaporozkoho).[1] Hetman of Zaporizhian Cossacks as a title was not officially recognized internationally until the creation of the Cossack Hetmanate. With the creation of Registered Cossacks units their leaders were officially referred to as Senior of His Royal Grace Zaporozhian Host (Ukrainian: старший його Королівської Милості Війська Запорозького, Starshyi Yoho Korolivskoi Mylosti Viiska Zaporozkoho).[1] Before 1648 and the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate there were numerous regional hetmans across the Dnieper-banks, who usually were starostas or voivodes.

The first widely recognized hetman of Zaporizhia was Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, after that several Polish starostas were added to the Hetman registry such as Lanckoroński and Daszkiewicz who also led their own Cossack formations. According to Mykhailo Hrushevsky they were not really considered as hetmans, at least by their contemporaries. Among others such starostas were Karpo Maslo from Cherkasy, Yatsko Bilous (Pereiaslav), Andrushko (Bratslav), and many others. Even Princes Konstanty Ostrogski and Bohdan Hlinski were conducting Cossack raids on Tatar uluses (districts).

The commanders of Zaporozhian Host units (the Kish) often considered as hetmans in fact carried a title of Kish Otaman. As from 1572,[2] hetman was the unofficial title of commanders of the Registered Cossack Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From the 1648 Bohdan Khmelnytsky uprising, Hetman was the title of the head of the Cossack state, the Cossack Hetmanate. Cossack hetmans had very broad powers and acted as supreme military commanders and executive leaders (by issuing administrative decrees).

After the split of Ukrainian territory along the Dnieper River by the Polish-Russian Treaty of Andrusovo 1667, there was an introduction of dual leadership for each bank, or for each Ukraine of Dnieper (left and right). After the Treaty of Andrusovo there existed two different Cossack Hetmanates with two Hetmans: the one in Poland being called Nakazny Hetman of His Royal Mercy of Zaporizhian Host, and the Russian one titled Hetman of His Tsar's Mercy of Zaporizhian Host.

Eventually the official state powers of Cossack Hetmans were gradually diminished in the 18th century, and finally abolished by Catherine II of Russia in 1764.

Historians such as Mykola Arkas[8] question legitimacy of the Teteria's elections accusing the later in corruption.[9] Also some sources claim election of Teteria being taken place in January 1663.[10] The election of Teteria led to the Povoloch Regiment Uprising in 1663, followed by bigger number of unrest in the modern region of Kirovohrad Oblast as well as Polesie (all in the Right-bank Ukraine).[11] Moreover, the political crisis that followed the Pushkar–Barabash Uprising divided the Cossack Hetmanate completely on both bank of Dnieper River.[11] Coincidentally, on 10 January 1663, the Tsardom of Muscovy created the new Little Russian Office (Prikaz) within its Ambassadorial Office.

Vouched by Charles Marie François Olier, marquis de Nointel, Yuriy Khmelnytsky was freed from the Ottoman captivity, appointed and along with Pasha Ibragim was sent to Ukraine fight the Moscow forces of Samoilovych and Romadanovsky. In 1681 Mehmed IV appointed George Ducas the Hetman of Ukraine, replacing Khmelnytsky.

Following the anathema on Mazepa and the election of Ivan Skoropadsky, Cossack Hetmanate was included into the Russian Government of Kiev in December 1708. Upon the death of Skoropadsky, the Hetman elections were disrupted and were awarded as a gift and a type of princely titles, first to Moldavian nobleman and later to the Russian Empress favorite.

On 5 April 1710 the council of cossacks, veterans of the battle at Poltava, elected Pylyp Orlyk as the Hetman of Ukraine in exile. Orlyk waged a guerrilla warfare at the southern borders of the Russian Empire with the support from Ottoman and Swedish empires.

The Appointed Hetman Mykhailo Khanenko was elected the Hetman of Ukraine by a council of Sukhoviy's Cossacks in Uman to depose Doroshenko. In 1675 John III Sobieski awarded the title to some Ostap Hohol (died in 1679). Same thing happened in 1683 when John III Sobieski awarded the title to Stefan Kunicki and in 1684 to Andriy Mohyla. Those awards were given during the Great Turkish War.

In 1669 Petro Doroshenko received a title of Sanjak-bey from Mehmed IV. Title existed in 1669 to 1683.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hetman_of_Zaporizhian_Cossacks

Magnates of Poland and Lithuania,"The magnates of Poland and Lithuania (Polish: magnateria, Lithuanian: magnatai) were an aristocracy of Polish-Lithuanian nobility (szlachta) that existed in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and, from the 1569 Union of Lublin, in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.[1]

The magnate social class arose around the 16th century and, over time, gained more and more control over Commonwealth politics. The most powerful magnates were known as ""little kings"" due to the extent of their power and independence. Their influence diminished with the Third Partition of Poland (1795), which ended the Commonwealth's independent existence, and came to an end with the Second World War and the communist-ruled People's Republic of Poland.

Famous magnate families in the territories of the Crown of Poland included the Czartoryski, Kalinowski, Koniecpolski, Krasinski, Ostrogski, Potocki, Tarnowski, Wiśniowiecki, Zasławski and Zamoyski families; and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the  Kieżgajłow, Olelkowicz, Radziwiłł, Pac and Sapieha families.

The magnates arose as the wealthiest and most politically powerful social class, part of the nobility (szlachta), of the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, around 16th century.[1] Some traced their ancestry to Gediminas, a Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1316, the Gediminids. Their powers waned after the Commonwealth loss of independence following its final partition in 1795, but they would remain a significant power in the culture, politics and economy of the Polish territories until World War II.[1]

Magnates (or higher nobility) vied for political power with the lesser and middle nobility (Ruch egzekucyjny in the late 16th century, and the reform movement of the Great Sejm in the late 18th century) and the King.[1] To be counted among the magnates, one should have a large estate, and political influence at least on the scale of a province, if not national.[1] Regional differences abounded, with the estates being much larger in the east, where the wealthier magnates were also much more likely to have their own private armies.[1][2] The eastern territories were more independent from the central power, and the large estates there, known as latifundia, with private cities and armies of the magnates, gave rise there to the term królewięta (""little kings"") used for the wealthiest of them - the developing aristocracy.[3][4] The magnates in the Royal Prussia had their fortunes build not around their own lands, but the royal grants (królewszczyzny).[1] The magnates tried to avoid splitting up of their lands, and some of the wealthiest families were able to protect their lands from division through the ordynacja system.[1] Magnate residences often became cultural and economic centers for a given region.[1]

Social mobility was present, in a limited fashion, as while the magnates preferred to marry within their own ranks, particularly wealthy of famous lesser nobles were able to join their ranks over time; this was the case with the Koniecpolski family, Ossoliński family and the Zamoyski family.[1]

From the late 16th century the influence of the magnates on Commonwealth politics rose sharply, through their participation in the administrative system (see offices of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and their control over the lesser nobility, which allowed them to influence the parliaments (local sejmiks and the national sejm walny) of the country.[1] From the second half of the 17th century, the magnates emerged as the victors in the struggle for power in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, leading some scholar to refer to this period as a time of the magnate oligarchy.[1] As Norman Davies noted, at that time ""political life [of Poland] was reduced to the feuds, fortunes, and the follies of a few families"".[5] Faced with the weakness of the king and parliament, the magnates were even able on occasion to start border wars (Magnate Moldavian Wars, the Dimitriads) or civil wars (Radziwiłł's rebellion during The Deluge, and the Sapieha's-centered Lithuanian Civil War of 1700).[1] Some magnates were also elected as kings of the Commonwealth; namely Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki and Stanisław August Poniatowski (a relative of the Czartoryski family).[6][7]

All members of the szlachta were equal under the law, therefore  ""magnate"" (Polish: magnat, Lithuanian: magnatas) was not an official title but rather a position of social class, based on wealth.[4][8][9] Several magnates held high feudal titles or peerage ranks such as prince or count.[4][8] With few exceptions, mostly dating from the Union of Lublin, and special privileges permitting some Lithuanian magnates to use them, such titles were forbidden by law. Titles from the offices in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth however were very popular.[4][8]

The wealthiest of magnates would wear crimson and scarlet items of clothing, leading to a nickname for that elite group, karmazyni (the ""crimson ones"").[10]

Famous magnate families from the Crown of Poland territories included: the Czartoryski, Kalinowski, Koniecpolski, Ossoliński, Ostrogski, Potocki, Wiśnowiecki, Zasławski, Zamoyski,[1] Krasiński,  Mielżyński, and Branicki families.

From the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, notable families included: the Alšėniškis, Astikai, Goštautai, Kęsgaila, Manvydas, Olelkovich, Pac, Radziwiłł, Sapieha, and Tyszkiewicz families.[11][1][12]

Major magnate residences, usually in the form of dwórs or dvaras and even outright palaces were found in: Pawłowice, Iwno, Biržai, Kėdainiai, Nesvizh, Slutsk, Kletsk, Slonim, Białystok, Sieraków, Leszno, Rydzyna, Gołuchów, Bieżuń, Jabłonna, Siedlce, Nieborów, Otwock, Pawłowice, Iwno, Vowchyn (Voŭčyn), Biała, Kodeń, Puławy, Białaczów, Końskie, Ujazd, Opole, Rytwiany, Baranów, Zamość, Chervonohrad, Łańcut, Ruzhany, Przeworsk, Zhovkva, Wiśnicz, Rzeszów, Dukla, Krasiczyn, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zolochiv, Brody, Pidhirtsi, Vyshnivets, Olyka, Korets, Ostroh, Iziaslav, Buchach, Zbarazh, Bila Tserkva, Sieniawa,  Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi and Tulchyn.[13][14]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnates_of_Poland_and_Lithuania

2012 Lithuanian parliamentary election,"Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 14 October 2012, with a second round on 28 October in the constituencies where no candidate won a majority in the first round of voting. All 141 seats in the Seimas were up for election; 71 in single-seat constituencies elected by majority vote and the remaining 70 in a nationwide constituency based on proportional representation. Together with the elections, a referendum on the construction of a new nuclear power plant was held.[1]

The Homeland Union, which had led the outgoing government, suffered as a result of its deeply unpopular austerity policies. The Lithuanian Social Democratic Party became the largest party in the Seimas after the elections, initially winning 38 seats (increasing to 39 after two by-elections). The Social Democratic Party and other left-wing parties had campaigned on the promise of ending the austerity, increasing the minimum wage, reducing unemployment and boosting public spending.

The Social Democratic Party formed a coalition with the Labour Party, Order and Justice and the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania. The resulting government was led by Algirdas Butkevičius.

The 2008 parliamentary elections were held on 12 October 2008, with the run-off on 26 October. The elections were won by the Homeland Union, which took 45 seats in the 141-member Tenth Seimas. The Homeland Union led a coalition in the parliament with the Liberal Movement, the Liberal and Centre Union and the National Resurrection Party. The populist National Resurrection Party splintered in 2010, with part of its representatives forming the Christian Party, while the remaining were absorbed by the Liberal and Centre Union in 2011. Social Democratic Party of Lithuania was the largest opposition party.

The leader of the Homeland Union, Andrius Kubilius, was appointed the Prime Minister heading a coalition government. Early in the term, the economy of Lithuania headed into severe recession, putting a strain on public finances which the government attempted to control by introducing broad austerity measures, including cuts to public spending and higher taxes. Despite the unpopularity of the measures and the resulting public protests, the coalition government became the first government in the history of Lithuania to serve the full term of the parliament.[2]

All seats in the 141-member Seimas were up for election in parallel voting, with 71 members elected in single-seat constituencies and 70 members elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency.[3] Voting in the elections was open to all citizens of Lithuania who are at least 18-years-old.

The first round took place on 9 October 2012. Members of the Seimas in the 71 single-seat constituencies were elected by a majority vote, with a run-off held on 28 October. The remaining 70 seats were allocated to the participating political parties using the largest remainder method, with a 5% threshold to enter the parliament. Candidates took the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the elections and adjusted by preference votes given by the voters.[3]

To be eligible for election, candidates had to be at least 25-years-old on the election day, not under allegiance to a foreign state and permanently resident in Lithuania. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the elections are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election.[3]

In addition, a person who has been removed from office through impeachment may not be elected. This provision was declared to be in violation of European Convention on Human Rights in 2011,[4] but the necessary changes to the constitution were not implemented before the election.[2]

The election campaign started in April 2012, when the President of Lithuania, Dalia Grybauskaitė, officially announced the election date.[5] Before the elections, five parties were expected to win representation in the Seimas based on the opinion polls: opposition Social Democrats, Order and Justice and Labour, as well as the ruling Homeland Union and Liberal Movement.[2]

Social Democratic Party, led by Algirdas Butkevičius, had been ahead in the polls for most of the year before the elections. Focusing on the public dissatisfaction with the government of Andrius Kubilius, Social Democrats promised to end the hated austerity measures and increase public spending,[2] even as analysts suggested it would have little room to maneuver.[6]

Populist Labour Party had consistently ranked second in the polls, led by Russian-born businessman-turned-politician Viktor Uspaskich. As part of the election campaign, the party promised to reduce unemployment and massively increase the minimum wage.[7] The party's vague but attractive message resonated with voters despite Uspaskich and the party long being under criminal investigation in Lithuania for false bookkeeping and tax evasion.[2]

Order and Justice was led by another controversial politician, Rolandas Paksas. Paksas, who was elected the President of Lithuania in 2003 and impeached in 2004. The lifetime ban preventing Paksas from running for office was deemed in violation of European Convention on Human Rights in 2011, creating the prospect of him heading the electoral list of Order and Justice.[4] Nevertheless, the constitutional court ruled that amendments to the constitution were required to implement the decision, and Paksas was prevented from running. Order and Justice campaigned on an anti-corruption platform, also promising to reduce inequality and reduce unemployment by distributing state land to farmers.[2]

Homeland Union, which had led the government for the preceding four years, and their coalition partners Liberal Movement took much of the blame for the unpopular austerity measures, suffering in the polls as a result. However, the Homeland Union exceeded expectations in the municipal elections in 2011, garnering the second-largest share of the vote (behind the Social Democrats),[2] raising hopes that both parties could take advantage of the improving economic situation following the Great Recession. President Grybauskaitė, foreign governments and the International Monetary Fund had also praised the government for the measures it took to avoid insolvency during the economic crisis.[8]

Other significant parties featuring in the polls included the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, a party with substantial support in areas with significant Polish and Russian minorities, the Way of Courage, a party focused on fighting an alleged pedophile conspiracy,[8] and YES, a movement led by the Mayor of Vilnius Artūras Zuokas.

Note: The National Resurrection Party (16 seats) had merged into the Liberal and Center Union in 2011. The New Union (Social Liberals) (1 seat) had merged into the Labour Party during the same year. Additionally, four seats were held by independent candidates.

The elections resulted in a win for Social Democratic Party, which took 38 seats in the Eleventh Seimas (up from 25). Other left-leaning parties performed well, with Labour Party winning 29 seats (up from 10) and Order and Justice getting 11 (down from 15), largely with the support of poorer and rural voters.

The ruling Homeland Union suffered in the elections, winning 33 seats (compared to 45 in the previous elections). The result was attributed to the party paying the price for unpopular austerity measures. Nevertheless, their result was better than had been expected before the elections, and the party was able to maintain its advantage in the second-largest city Kaunas, a historical stronghold of the party, as well as move ahead in the capital Vilnius for the first time. Their coalition partners, the Liberal Movement (10 seats, down from 11), secured the lead in Lithuania's third largest city, Klaipėda.[15]

Election results in one constituency were declared invalid by the Central Election Commission due to allegations of vote-buying.[18] The parliament subsequently invalidated the results of another constituency due to voting irregularities following a verdict of the constitutional court.[19] New elections were held in the two constituencies, as well as in another where the member of the parliament (Julius Veselka) had died in office,[20] on 3 March 2013, with a run-off on 17 March. As a result, Social Democrats gained one seat from the table above.

Allegations of vote buying surfaced after the first round of the elections. In total, the police has investigated 27 cases of possible irregularities, including 18 suspected cases of vote buying, mostly involving the Labour Party. The Central Electoral Commission, as well as prosecution authorities,  claimed that two Labour Party members had purchased votes and the Commission invalidated the results in one single-seat constituency. Labour Party leader Uspaskich denounced the allegations as politically motivated and warned that no one should disrespect the popular choice.[21]

Following the elections, the winning Social Democrats proposed forming a government coalition with the Labour Party and Order and Justice, with Algirdas Butkevičius as the designated Prime Minister. President Grybauskaitė indicated that she would not accept the Labour Party as part of the government, due to the allegation of electoral fraud and fraudulent bookkeeping. The outgoing prime minister Kubilius presented the Homeland Union as an alternative coalition partner,[22] a suggestion that Butkevičius quickly rejected.[21]

After the longest period of government formation in modern Lithuanian history, a coalition government consisting of Social Democrats, Labour, Order and Justice and the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania was appointed in December. President Grybauskaitė confirmed the government after initially rejecting all of the ministers proposed by the Labour Party.[23]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Lithuanian_parliamentary_election
Lithuanians in Belarus,"Lithuanians in Belarus (Lithuanian: Baltarusijos lietuviai; Belarusian: Беларускія літоўцы, romanized: Bielaruskija litoŭcy; Russian: Белорусские литовцы, romanized: Belorusskiye litovtsy) have a long history, as the lands of what is now Belarus was part of Lithuania[note 1] for more than half a millennium from the 13th century onwards. The land of what is now Belarus was originally inhabited by Balts, while Slavs arrived in those lands during the late Early Middle Ages.

According to the 2009 census in Belarus, there were 19,091 ethnic Lithuanians in Belarus.[1] Lithuanians are most significantly concentrated in Grodno and western Vitebsk regions, which border Lithuania, but concentrations of Lithuanians can also be found in Belarus' eastern regions.

The history of ethnic Balts in what is now Belarus is evidenced by numerous archaeological finds, hydronyms and toponyms. The territory of modern Belarus was inhabited solely by Balts from at least 2nd millennium BC.[1] From the later part of the 1st millennium AD until the advent of Slavicisation, the numbers of Balts decreased, although isolated islands that maintained their culture remained.[1]

Throughout the existence of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the territory of modern Belarus was inhabited by many Lithuanians. Written sources mention that Lithuanians lived in the Orsha District.[1] Here, the remaining pagan Lithuanians were baptised in 1387 during the Christianization of Lithuania and the Roman Catholic parish of Obolcai [lt] (which is located to the west of Orsha) was established.[1] In the 15th and 16th centuries, the districts of Lida (Lithuanian: Lyda), Kreva (Lithuanian: Krėva), Ashmyany (Lithuanian: Ašmena), Smarhon (Lithuanian: Smurgainiai), Myadzyel (Lithuanian: Medilas), Vileyka (Lithuanian: Vileika), Vidzy (Lithuanian: Vidžiai) and Braslaw (Lithuanian: Breslauja), were Lithuanian.[1] Some of the inhabitants of these areas were Polonized, while another part became Belarusified during the 16th to the 19th centuries.[1] Until the 19th century Grodno (Lithuanian: Gardinas) with its surrounding vicinities belonged to the Lithuanian ethnographic area.[2]

From the 13th century to the end of the 18th century, all of modern Belarus belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1]

During the 19th century and until the early 20th century, Belarus was governed by the Russian Empire.[1]

In the mid-19th century, the areas of Perlamas [lt], Ašiuža [lt], Pariečė [lt], Rodūnia, Pelesa (Pelyasa [be]), Asava [lt], Voranava, Benekainys [lt], Apsas [lt], Drūkšiai [lt] were Lithuanian.[1] In the late 19th century, Lithuanian villages like Dimanovas [lt], Malkava [lt], and Sofeiskas were established by Lithuanians who moved there from the Vilnius and Kaunas Governorates.[1]

In the 20th century, Lithuanians remained in some villages within the districts of Voranava, Astravyets, Iwye and Braslaw (Lithuanian: Varanavas, Astravas, Vija, Breslauja, respectively).[1] In 1915, as many Lithuanians fled through Belarus eastwards due to the ongoing World War I, so in Minsk and elsewhere, there existed chapters of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers.[1]

During 1918–1920, the Lithuanian inhabitants of the eastern ethnographic Lithuania, which is now in Belarus, sought that those territories would be once more part of Lithuania.[1] The Belarusian Democratic Republic was a failed Belarusian attempt at independence in the aftermath of World War I, whose territorial claims included ethnically Lithuanian lands. However, Eastern Belorussia was de facto occupied by Soviet Russia by 1920, which created the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[1] In December 1922, the Byelorussian SSR became one of the Soviet republics and formally one of the Soviet Union's founders.[1] In 1920–1939, Western Belorussia was ruled by the Second Polish Republic.[1] After 1939, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, a part of the ethnically Lithuanian lands like Opsa [lt] (Apsas), Pieliasa [lt] (Pelesa), Radun (Rodūnia, Rodūnė), Hieliuny [lt] (Gėliūnai), Hierviaty [lt] (Gervėčiai), Hiry [lt] (Girios), Rymdziuny [lt] (Rimdžiūnai), and other villages, which were inhabited by 24,000 Lithuanians until World War II, were included into the territory that is now Belarus.[1]

From 1927 to 1944 in Belarus, there were four Communist publications in Lithuanian.[1] To spread Communist ideas, there was a Lithuanian bureau that was part of the Department for Agitation and Propaganda of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia in 1927–30.[1] Then, in 1931–38, the bureau was part of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Western Belorussia.[1] In 1927–32, there was a Lithuanian section in Byelorussia's Proletarian Writer's Association.[1] In 1927–37, there were Lithuanian sectors in Academy of Sciences of the Byelorussian SSR and the Government's publication company.[1] The Minsk Radio had weekly Lithuanian radio programs during 1928–37.[1] In 1928, there were ten Lithuanian primary schools throughout what is now Belarus. In 1929–38, there was the Lithuanian middle school of Zigmas Angarietis in Dymanova [lt] (Dimanovas).[1]

During World War II, in the ethnically Lithuanian lands that were assigned to Generalbezirk Litauen, Lithuanian schools were established and Church services in Lithuanian were revived.[1] At the end of summer in 1941 Lithuanian self-defence units, wearing the Lithuanian military uniforms, appeared in Grodno and were commanded by major Albinas Levickas.[3] Subsequently, priest Viktoras Kurgonas established the Lithuanian National Committee (Lithuanian: Lietuvių tautinis komitetas) in Grodno and collaborated with Albinas Levickas.[3] Both of them fluently spoke German and supported starving Lithuanians.[3] At the time, the St. Mary's Church (Vytautas the Great's Church) was allocated to the Lithuanians in Grodno and Lithuanian religious services were held in it.[3]

However, all schools were closed  in the aftermath of World War II with the Soviet re-occupation of Lithuania.[1]

During the Soviet occupation, most of the prominent Lithuanian cultural and political figures were executed or deported to Siberia, including the Lithuanian communists.[1]

From 1957, there were Lithuanian language lessons in eight local schools in the districts of Gervėčiai and Pelesa, but their number was reduced and they remained only in Gervėčiai, Pelesa and Girios.[1]

According to the census of 2009, there were 19,091 Lithuanians in Belarus.[1]

The usage of the Lithuanian language in Belarus has declined significantly from a peak in 1959. Originally at 77%, the number of Lithuanian Belarusians who considered Lithuanian their native language had declined to 52% by the 1999 census, and to 31% by the 2009 census. The Russian language (and, to an extent, the Belarusian language) have filled the gap to replace Lithuanian, with 39% of Lithuanians speaking Russian natively and 26% speaking Belarusian natively.[4]

Only 5% of Lithuanians in Belarus spoke the Lithuanian language at home according to the 2009 census, but a significant divide exists between rural and urban Lithuanian populations; roughly 13% of rural Belarusian Lithuanians use Lithuanian at home, versus only 2% of urban Belarusian Lithuanians. A plurality of the rural population (42%) uses the Belarusian language at home, while most of the urban population (79%) speaks Russian.[4]

As of 2022[update], according to the Code of the Republic of Belarus on Education, article 82, there is no general education in the languages of national minorities; their languages and literature will be studied as an optional subject in separate groups and classes.[5]

Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1500–1503),"The Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1500–1503) also known as the Second Lithuanian–Muscovite War was a war between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania led by Alexander Jagiellon, Konstanty Ostrogski and the Livonian Confederation led by Wolter von Plettenberg against the Principality of Moscow led by Ivan III of Russia and Daniil Shchenya and the Crimean Khanate led by Meñli I Giray. It ended in a victory for Muscovy and its allies.

The First border war ended with a Muscovite victory.[3] At the end of it, an eternal peace treaty was concluded, where most of the ""Upper Oka Principalities"" and Veliky Novgorod, Pskov, Tver and Ryazan were ceded to Moscow by Lithuania. Moscow renounced its claims on Smolensk and Bryansk which were to remain part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In addition to this, Alexander Jagiellon married Ivan III's daughter Elena.[4]

Hostilities were renewed in May 1500[5] when Ivan III took advantage of a planned Polish–Hungarian campaign against the Ottoman Empire.[6] He figured that if Poland and Hungary were preoccupied with the Ottomans, they would not be able to assist Lithuania.

The war was to take place in three general places, those being Novhorod-Siverskyi, Smolensk and Toropets.[7] The main fighting happened in the direction of Smolensk, which was the second most strategically important front of the war.[7]

The Muscovites managed to quickly occupy Lithuanian fortresses in Bryansk, Vyazma,[5] Dorogobuzh, Toropets and Putivl.[7][8] After capturing the fortress at Dorogobuzh, half of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian Army, which was a vanguard of about 3,500 horsemen moved towards Smolensk, meeting up with 500 horsemen led by Stanisław Kiszka.[7] Local nobles such as the Vorotynskys often joined the Muscovite army. Another attack came from the southeast into the Kiev Voivodeship, Volhynia and Podolia. On 14 July 1500, the Lithuanians fought against the Muscovite army in the Battle of Vedrosha.[9]

The Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski was confident in his strength, although heavily underestimated the Muscovite army. He decided to attack first with an army of 4,000 soldiers against the Muscovite army numbering at least 20,000 soldiers.[7] The Lithuanians attacked the camp of the central Muscovites forces at a tributary of the Dnieper, the Vedrosha river, but were tricked into a well–organised ambush.[7]

The Lithuanian army was lured into the main Muscovite army numbering around 40,000 soldiers commanded by boyars Daniil Shchenya and Yakov Koshkin-Zakharyin [ru]. The battle ended in a decisive defeat for Lithuania.[10]

The entire Lithuanian military leadership was captured by Muscovite forces, including Grand Hetman of Lithuania Konstanty Ostrogski,[7] although he escaped from Moscow in 1507.[10]

This defeat greatly affected Lithuanian society, mostly politically and morally.[7] The Lithuanian army received a painful lesson, in which they learnt to not divide limited forces for important operations and, on the contrary, concentrate them as much as possible.[7] The defeat was also one of the reasons for the proposed Union of Mielnik between Poland and Lithuania.[11]

The battle took place on November 4, 1501, when Ivan III sent a new force under the command of Semyon Mozhayskiy [ru] towards Mstislavl.[12] Local princes Mstislavsky together with Ostap Dashkevych organised the defense and were badly beaten.[12][13] Russian forces took advantage of the princes retreat, besieging the city and pillaging surrounding areas.[13] A relief force was organised by Great Hetman Stanislovas Kęsgaila, but neither him nor Mozhayskiy dared to attack with the Russian forces retreating without a battle.[14] The Lithuanian forces had once again been defeated.

In June 1501, John I Albert, King of Poland died. This left his brother, Alexander Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania as the strongest candidate to the Polish throne. Due to this, he became preoccupied with the succession.[15] Alexander tried to counter religious accusations by attempting to establish a church union between Catholics and Orthodox as envisioned at the Council of Florence – the Orthodox would retain their traditions but would accept the pope as their spiritual sovereign.[16] The Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus' agreed to such an arrangement, but Helena was against it. Polish nobles, including Bishop Erazm Ciołek and Cardinal Frederick Jagiellon, discussed the issue of royal divorce.[16]

The war continued, although not as successfully for Moscow. The Livonian Confederation led by Wolter von Plettenberg joined the war on Lithuania's side due to concluding a ten–year alliance on 17 May 1501.[8] Their first success was seen in the Battle of the Siritsa River.

The battle took place on 27 August 1501 between the Livonian Confederation against the Principality of Moscow and Pskov Republic. The Livonian army consisted of 4,000 mounted knights and 2,000 foot landsknechts[17] according to Aleksandr Zimin or 12,000[18] according to Cathal J. Nolan. The Muscovite army consisted of 6,000 warriors[17] according to Zimin and 40,000[18] according to Nolan.

The Pskovians attacked first, although were thrown back by the Livonians. The Livonian artillery then destroyed the remainder of the Muscovite army despite a Russian attempt to reply with their own, insufficient artillery force. The Livonians defeated the Muscovites, largely due to the Russians' significant shortage of guns of any kind.[19]

After the Battle of the Siritsa River, the Livonians besieged Pskov and won the Battle of Lake Smolino [ru] in September 1502.

Smolensk was a strong and strategically important fortress, having been part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since 1404. The Russian army had reached it in June 1502, although Smolensk was well prepared.[20] The Russian army plundered Orsha and Vitebsk and attacked Smolensk with insufficient artillery.[20] Not only was the assault on 16 September repelled, but the defense had managed to grow into a counterattack. Lithuanian reinforcements were brought by Stanislovas Kęsgaila as well, eventually forcing the Russians to retreat,[14] suffering a defeat.

The Golden Horde was an ally of Lithuania. The Crimean Khanate had managed to subjugate what remained of the Great Horde after sacking the capital New Sarai in 1502.[21] It had also managed to pillage the Lithuania's southern towns of Slutsk, Kletsk, and Nyasvizh, even threatening the capital city of Vilnius.

The peace negotiations had begun in mid–1502 while the Siege of Smolensk was still ongoing. Alexander asked Vladislaus II of Hungary to act as the mediator, and a six-year truce was concluded on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1503.[16]

The war had ended, with devastating terms for Lithuania. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost approximately 210,000 square kilometres (81,000 sq mi),[22] or a third of its territory: Chernigov, Novgorod-Seversk, Starodub, and lands around the upper Oka River.[23] Russian historian Matvei Kuzmich Liubavskii counted Lithuanian losses at 70 volosts, 22 towns, and 13 villages.[24]

The Lithuanians acknowledged Ivan's title, sovereign of all Russia.[25][26] Historian Edvardas Gudavičius said: ""The war of 1492–1494 was a kind of reconnaissance mission conducted by the united Russia. [The terms of] the ceasefire of 1503 showed the planned political aggression of Russia, its undoubted military superiority. The concept of the sovereign of all Russia, put forward by Ivan III, did not leave room for the existence of the Lithuanian state"".[26]

Although Moscow had failed to capture Smolensk in this war, it successfully did so in the Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1512–1522) with the Siege of Smolensk in 1514.[27]

Due to the Crimean Khanate managing to impose a threat on Vilnius during the war, Alexander Jagiellon ordered the construction of a defensive wall around his capital, which was completed in 1522.[28]

The Livonian Order and Principality of Moscow didn't fight against each other until the Livonian War (1558–1583), where the Livonian Confederation was dissolved in the Treaty of Vilnius (1561).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian–Muscovite_War_(1500–1503)
Union of Lublin,"The Union of Lublin (Polish: Unia lubelska; Lithuanian: Liublino unija) was signed on 1 July 1569 in Lublin, Poland, and created a single state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest countries in Europe at the time. It replaced the personal union of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with a real union and an elective monarchy, as Sigismund II Augustus, the last of the Jagiellons, remained childless after three marriages. In addition, the autonomy of Royal Prussia was largely abandoned. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno (1566), became a Polish–Lithuanian condominium.[1]

The Commonwealth was ruled by a single elected monarch who carried out the duties of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and governed with a common Senate and parliament (the Sejm). The Union is seen by some as an evolutionary stage in the Polish–Lithuanian alliance and personal union, necessitated also by Lithuania's dangerous position in wars with Russia.[2][3][4]

There were long discussions before signing the union treaty. Lithuanian magnates were afraid of losing much of their power, since the union would make their legal status equal to that of the much more numerous Polish lower nobility. Lithuania had been increasingly on the losing side of the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars, however, and by the second half of the 16th century, it faced the threat of total defeat in the Livonian War and incorporation into the Tsardom of Russia.[citation needed] The Polish nobility (the szlachta), on the other hand, were reluctant to offer more help to Lithuania without receiving anything in exchange (as much as 70% of the taxes collected in Poland in the 1560s went to support Lithuania in its war with Moscow).[5][6] The Polish and Lithuanian elites strengthened personal bonds and had opportunities to plan their united futures during increased military cooperation.[7]

Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, seeing the threat to Lithuania and eventually to Poland, pressed for the union, gradually gaining more followers until he felt enough support to forcibly evict landowners who opposed the transition of territory from Lithuania to Poland.[8] A clear motivation for Sigismund was that he was the last Jagiello and had no children or brothers who could inherit the throne. Therefore, the Union was an attempt to preserve the continuity of his dynasty's work since the personal (but not constitutional) union of Poland and Lithuania as a result of the marriage of Jadwiga and Jogaila. The Union was one of the constitutional changes required to establish a formal elective monarchy, which would simultaneously reign over both domains.[8]

The Sejm met in January 1569, near the Polish town of Lublin, but did not reach an agreement (sejm of 1569 in Lublin [pl]). One of the points of contention was the right of Poles to settle and own land in the Grand Duchy. After most of the Lithuanian delegation under the leadership of Vilnius Voivodeship's Mikołaj ""Rudy"" Radziwiłł left Lublin on 1 March, the king responded by annexing Podlachie, Volhynian, Bracław, and the Kiev Voivodeships to the Crown (on 6 June), with wide approval from the local gentry.[9][10] Those historic lands of Rus' are over half of modern Ukraine and were then a substantial portion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's territory. The Rus' nobles there were eager to capitalise on the economic and political opportunities offered by the Polish sphere, and by and large, they wanted their lands to become a part of the Polish Crown.[11]

The Lithuanians were forced to return to the Sejm under the leadership of Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz (father of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz) and to continue negotiations, using slightly different tactics from those of Radziwiłł. Though the Polish szlachta wanted full incorporation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the Crown, the Lithuanians continued to oppose that and agreed only to a federal state. On 28 June 1569, the last objections were overcome, and on 4 July, an act was accordingly signed by the king at Lublin Castle.[9]

The Union of Lublin was superseded by the Constitution of 3 May 1791, under which the federal Commonwealth was to be transformed into a unitary state by King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The status of semi-federal state was restored by the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. The constitution was not fully implemented, however, and the Commonwealth was ended with the Partitions of Poland in 1795.

After the Union, the Lithuanian nobles had the same formal rights as the Polish to rule the lands and subjects under their control. However, political advancement in the Catholic-dominated Commonwealth was a different matter.[citation needed]

By the late 15th century, the Polish language was already making rapid inroads among the Lithuanian and Rus' elites.[9] The Lublin Union accelerated the process of Polonization. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant for the Ruthenian nobility, most of whom were initially Ruthenian-speaking and Eastern Orthodox by religion. However the commoners, especially the peasants, continued to speak their own languages and after the Union of Brest converted to Eastern Catholicism.[citation needed]

This eventually created a significant rift between the lower social classes and the nobility in the Lithuanian and Ruthenian areas of the Commonwealth.[11] Some Ruthenian magnates resisted Polonization (like the Ostrogskis) by adhering to Orthodox Christianity, giving generously to the Ruthenian Orthodox Churches and to the Ruthenian schools. However, the pressure of Polonization was harder to resist with each subsequent generation and eventually almost all of the Ruthenian nobility was Polonized.[citation needed]

The Cossack uprisings and foreign interventions led to the partitions of the Commonwealth by Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1772, 1793, and 1795. The Union of Lublin was also temporarily inactive while the Union of Kėdainiai was in effect.[citation needed]

Many historians like Krzysztof Rak consider the Union of Lublin to have created a state similar to the present-day European Union,[12] thus considering the Union (along with the Kalmar Union, the several Acts of Union in the British Isles and other similar treaties) to be a predecessor of the Maastricht Treaty. The former, however, created a state of countries more deeply linked than the present-day European Union.[citation needed]

The union brought about the Polish colonization of Ruthenian lands and increasing enserfment of Ruthenian peasantry by the szlachta.[13][14][15][16] Although the conditions for peasants in the Commonwealth was quite dire, compared to the West (see second serfdom), the peasants in the Commonwealth had more freedom than those in Russia; hence peasants (as well as to a lesser extent nobility and merchants) escaping from Russia to the Commonwealth became a major concern for the Russian government, and was one of the factors ultimately leading to the partitions of Poland.[17]

A common coin, the złoty, was introduced.[citation needed]

Execution of crown lands was not extended to the Grand Duchy.[citation needed]

The Union created one of the largest and most populous states in 17th-century Europe (excluding the states not completely in Europe, i.e. the Russian and Ottoman Empires).[18]

As part of the Union, Lithuania lost Podlaskie, Volhynia, Podolia and Kiev voivodeships to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.[citation needed]

The Statutes of Lithuania declared the laws of the Union that conflicted with them to be unconstitutional. The First Statute of Lithuania was also used in the territories of Lithuania that were annexed by Poland shortly before the Union of Lublin (except for Podlaskie). These conflicts between statutory schemes in Lithuania and Poland persisted for many years, and the Third Statute of Lithuania remained in force in territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania even after partitions, until 1840.

Attempts to limit the power of Lithuanian magnates (especially the Sapieha family) and unify the laws of the Commonwealth led to the koekwacja praw movement, culminating in the koekwacja reforms of the Election Sejm of 1697 (May–June), confirmed in the General Sejm of 1698 (April) in the document Porządek sądzenia spraw w Trybunale Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskego.[19]

Poland provided military aid in the wars after the union of the two entities, which was crucial for the survival of the Grand Duchy.[3] Poland and the Grand Duchy were to have separate military but common defense policies.[citation needed]

The Union of Lublin provided for merger of the two states, though each retained substantial autonomy, with their own army, treasury, laws and administration.[10] Though the countries were in theory equal, the larger Poland became the dominant partner. Due to population differences, Polish deputies outnumbered Lithuanians in the Sejm by 3:1.[10]

There was to be a single ruler for both Poland and the Grand Duchy, freely elected by the nobility of both nations, and crowned as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in Wawel Cathedral, Kraków.[citation needed] The demand of a separate inauguration ceremony of the Grand Duke of Lithuania was raised by the nobles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. Mikołaj ""the Red"" Radziwiłł, Eustachy Wołłowicz, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Konstanty Ostrogski) during the negotiations of the Union of Lublin, however it was not officially included into it.[20] Nevertheless, on 29 May 1580, a separate ceremony was held in the Vilnius Cathedral during which bishop Merkelis Giedraitis presented Stephen Báthory (King of Poland since 1 May 1576) a decorated sword and a hat adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself), while this ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, this way ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin.[21][22][23][24]

A common parliament, the Sejm, held its sessions in Warsaw; it had 114 deputies from the Polish lands and 48 from Lithuania. The Senate had 113 Polish and 27 Lithuanian senators.[citation needed]

Poland and the Grand Duchy were to have a common foreign policy.[citation needed]

The Union of Lublin was Sigismund's greatest achievement and his greatest failure. Although it created one of the largest states in contemporary Europe, one that endured for over 200 years,[25] Sigismund failed to push through the reforms that would have established a workable political system. He hoped to strengthen the monarchy with the support of the lesser nobility, and to balance the power of lesser nobility and magnates. However, while all the nobility in the Commonwealth was in theory equal under the law, the political power of the magnates was not weakened significantly, and in the end they could too often bribe or coerce their lesser brethren.[9] In addition, the royal power continued to wane, and while the neighbouring states continued to evolve into strong, centralized absolute monarchies, the Commonwealth slid with its Golden Liberty into a political anarchy that eventually cost it its very existence.[26]

Following the Żeligowski's Mutiny after which the Lithuania's capital Vilnius Region was occupied and which eventually led to the annexation of it into Republic of Poland in 1922, the Lithuanians formally renounced the 1569 Union of Lublin.[27][28]

Today's Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,[29] whereas the interwar Republic of Lithuania viewed the Commonwealth's creation in mostly negative light.[30]

Truce of Yam-Zapolsky,"The Truce or Treaty of Yam-Zapolsky (Ям-Запольский) or Jam Zapolski, signed on 15 January 1582 between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia, was one of the treaties that ended the Livonian War.[1] It followed the successful Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, culminating in the siege of Pskov.

The truce was concluded with help of papal legate Antonio Possevino and was signed for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stefan Batory and for Russia by Tsar Ivan the Terrible, and established a ten-year truce.

In the terms of the treaty, Russia renounced its claims to Livonia and Polotsk but conceded no core Russian territories as Batory returned the territories his armies had been occupying (particularly, he gave up on the siege of Pskov and left the town of Velikiye Luki. The truce was extended for twenty years in 1600, when a diplomatic mission to Moscow led by Lew Sapieha concluded negotiations with Tsar Boris Godunov.  The truce was broken when the Poles invaded Russia in 1605.

One of the principal negotiators on the Polish side was Krzysztof Warszewicki.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_of_Yam-Zapolsky
History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648–1764),"The history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1648–1764) covers a period in the history of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, from the time their joint state became the theater of wars and invasions fought on a great scale in the middle of the 17th century, to the time just before the election of Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[1]

From the 17th century, the nobles' democracy, experienced devastating wars and fell into internal disorder and then anarchy, and as a result declined. The once powerful Commonwealth had become vulnerable to internal warfare and foreign intervention. In 1648 the Cossack Khmelnytsky Uprising engulfed the south and east of the vast Polish–Lithuanian state, and was soon followed by a Swedish invasion, which raged through core Polish lands. Warfare with the Cossacks and Russia left Ukraine divided; the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, became a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. John III Sobieski, who fought protracted wars against the Ottoman Empire, revived the Commonwealth's military might once more. In one decisive engagement he helped in 1683 to deliver Vienna from a Turkish onslaught.[1]

Further disintegration followed nevertheless. The Commonwealth, subjected to almost constant warfare until 1720, suffered devastating population losses and massive damage to its economy and social structure. The economic regression had not been fully compensated for the duration of the Commonwealth's existence.[2] The government became ineffective because of large scale internal conflicts (e.g. Lubomirski's Rokosz against John II Casimir and rebellious confederations), corrupted legislative processes (such as the infamous use of the liberum veto) and manipulation by foreign interests. The nobility class fell under the control of a handful of powerful families with established territorial domains, the urban population and infrastructure fell into ruin, together with most peasant farms.[1]

The reigns of two kings of the Saxon Wettin dynasty, Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III, brought the Commonwealth more political damage and little meaningful reform. The Great Northern War, a period seen by the contemporaries as a passing eclipse, may have been the decisive blow that critically weakened the Polish-Lithuanian state. The Kingdom of Prussia became a strong regional power and took Silesia from the Habsburg monarchy. The Commonwealth-Saxony personal union, however, gave rise to the emergence of the reform movement in the Commonwealth, and the beginnings of the Polish Enlightenment culture.[1]

The economic breakdown in the Commonwealth in the second half of the 17th century has often been seen as a result of the destruction of the country caused by wars. There were also other depressing factors present that affected at that time large portions of Europe, to which the manorial, serfdom-based economy of the Commonwealth had tried to adjust. The particular solutions adopted resulted eventually in deterioration of the effectiveness of agricultural practices, lower productivity and pauperization of the rural population. But the degree to which the economic regression in the Commonwealth had progressed had no parallels in the economies of the neighboring countries, some of which practiced the same type of rural economy. While the war destruction that took place during the events of 1655–60 was particularly devastating, the Commonwealth was subjected to constant warfare from 1648 to 1720.[3]

Unlike the previously fought wars, which had affected mostly the peripheries of the huge state, from the mid-17th century onward central Poland was being ravaged by warfare as well. The two Northern Wars turned out particularly destructive. Several massive foreign armies traversed the Commonwealth in the course of the Second Northern War. The protracted role of the country as a battlefield, the quartering of troops and armies, combined with the policy of exacting contributions and pillage during the Great Northern War, greatly deteriorated the economy of the country which had not yet recovered from the damage incurred two generations earlier. Internal warfare and looting by unpaid Commonwealth troops added to the damage.[3]

The destruction and depletion of resources applied to all segments of the society, affecting rural villages, cities and towns, of which many had practically lost their urban character. Industry and manufacturing suffered as well as the funds flowing into the state treasury. The war losses and epidemic disease outbreaks (especially during 1659–63)[4] reduced the population by a third to 6–7 million. As the peasants, the townspeople and ordinary szlachta each lost their economic base, the magnate class had become the only social group capable of significant economic and political activity, which led to their more total domination of what was left of the Commonwealth politics.[3]

The war and economic pressures intensified the already present fragmentation processes and class conflicts between the social classes and within each of them. Xenophobia and intolerance became prevalent, different social and territorial groups stressed their separate statuses and traditions. The nation building efforts of Renaissance era reformers was undone.[3]

The predominant 16th century agricultural production organization, the Szlachta's folwark gave way by the middle of the 17th century to the magnate-owned latifundia, huge networks of landed estates. Latifundia were present throughout the Polish–Lithuanian federation, but developed most extensively in the eastern reaches of the Crown, having expanded in that direction before the Union of Lublin. War destruction affected the diversified magnate possessions to a lesser degree than single estates of middle szlachta, which increasingly turned szlachta into dependent clients of their ""elder brothers"". Parts of a latifundium were typically leased or run by hired szlachta or urban, often Jewish, hierarchy of administrators, with each layer exploiting the serf laborers. The various aspects of commercial life in the territories, including agriculture, trade, mining, and manufacturing, had previously been controlled by szlachta in a legally protected way. Now, in the more decentralized and anarchistic feudal state, the magnate class was in a position to establish in its state-like domains absolute rule, based not on laws but on practical advantages they enjoyed. The regional authority and power that the magnates attained was exerted by a variety of means, including private military forces.[5]

The increased dominance of the magnates negatively affected the class integrity of the so far crucially important middle szlachta stratum. The fragmentation of szlachta deepened the decentralizing tendencies in the large state. The magnates established networks of szlachta supporters and national loyalty was being replaced with loyalty based on regional ties, as for the nobility the weak state institutions provided neither attractive career opportunities, nor sufficient protection.[5]

The magnate control over the lesser or petty szlachta (szlachta zaściankowa), a group whose members possessed little or no property and were poorly educated, has long been recognized. The lesser szlachta was useful, as it provided crowds of armed men able to influence various public events, such as sejmiks or elections, according to directions given.[5] Most commonly the basic ""clientele"" of the magnates constituted the lowest ranked nobles, czynszownicy (renters), free but landless and poor, whose status in reality resembled that of the peasants: they were completely dependent on a wealthy patron. The brukowcy (pavement people) had no property and engaged in a variety of trades. Domestic szlachta functioned as servants in magnate family households. Szlachta zaściankowa proper, or zagrodowa (homestead people) was the very numerous propertied petty nobility; among the lower ranks they alone enjoyed something of a, at least symbolic, privileged noble status.[6]

Of fundamentally greater importance was the role of the middle nobility, propertied and better qualified people, able to pursue careers within magnate courts, or assume public offices obtained with the help of their magnate benefactors. The noblemen in question, through the magnates they served, experienced also material gains, such as profitable land leases, and legal protection in times of common and often reckless and disruptive litigation.[5]

The magnates themselves or magnate clans formed groupings, or factions, with common regional or other interests. In the 17th century, the factions were usually confined to a region, such as the Lithuanian cliques of the Pac or Sapieha families. In the 18th century, the Czartoryskis and the Potockis established Commonwealth-wide magnate factions of great importance.[5]

The subordination to magnate interests took place not without some resistance, but the various szlachta movements lacked coordination and in the first half of the 18th century the middle nobility ceased being an independent force in national politics.[5]

The lack of legal distinction among various ranks of the nobility gave many noblemen a false sense of equality and opportunity. The majority of the nobility of the Lithuanian, Ruthenian, or German origin, had become Polonized and Catholic. Some minority Protestant nobility remained active in Royal Prussia and Greater Poland. After the triumph of the Counter-Reformation, the Jesuits and other Catholic educators lost incentives to provide competitive high-quality education. The backward mentality and close-mindedness of the szlachta masses has become proverbial, and as the nation experienced its greatest decline, the typically uniform szlachta indulged in the sarmatism ideology of a chosen nation and contempt for everything foreign. Nonconformity was not tolerated, corruption was at its highest, while public morale at the lowest.[5]

Among the more worldly of the magnates, influenced by foreign elements in the Commonwealth's royal courts and West European currents, admiration of foreign (often French and German) ways and fashions was becoming increasingly common. The magnates built splendid palaces of brick and stone in the main cities and on their rural estates; the wooden manors and feasting social life style of the szlachta attempted to imitate the surroundings and lives of the rich, famous and powerful.[5]

The deep agricultural crisis lasted from the 1650s through the 1720s. Under the plight of constant warfare and adverse economic conditions the peasants were being increasingly burdened with excessive obligations. Their communities suffered population losses and many villages disappeared altogether. The serf labor force was displaced and their plots taken over under estate consolidation schemes (to further increase the already dominant folwark portion of the rural economy), or manorial duties were replaced by feudal rent arrangements if that seemed more profitable to landlords. Those and many other measures amounting to extreme exploitation and imposition of hardship had not resulted in increased production, but rather made the crisis more acute by ruining the peasant farming operation. Not all the regions suffered equally, as northern Poland's (Gdańsk Pomerania and Greater Poland) agriculture maintained moderate profitability, while southern Poland (Lesser Poland) experienced the greatest rural decline, and correspondingly the greatest decrease in the percentage of farms under peasant family hereditary holding.[7][d]

After the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the Swedish Deluge, approx. 35% of villages in Royal Prussia and 60% in Podolia were destroyed completely.[8]

The tendency was for each village, or a small cluster of villages, possibly corresponding to a parish, to function as a self-contained organism, arbitrarily ruled by the lord's administrator, with some participation from local self-government, whose continuous existence depended on its degree of cooperativeness. The parish schools taught mostly the catechism with added social indoctrination. The one allowed peasant activity, sometimes even required because of mandatory purchases of such staples as beer form the lord's brewery, was the participation in village tavern life. The taverns provided some entertainment, functioned as outlets for significant folk artistic creativity, and places of occasional contacts with traveling representatives of the largely unknown to the peasants, outside world.[7]

Average living conditions in the increasingly impoverished rural villages were very bad and the exploited peasants resorted to various forms of resistance, most often running away from particularly abusive landlords. Some villages or areas engaged in collectively refusing to perform the prescribed duties, or, rarely in ethnically Polish lands, armed rebellions. The Kostka-Napierski Uprising took place in 1651, there were rebellions in the Podhale region in 1670 and in other regions in 1735–38. In Silesia the ethnically Polish peasantry rebelled during 1722–29 and in 1750 around Pszczyna, when the Prussian army was brought to bear. Highway robbery band activity was another form of peasant resistance; some of its leaders, especially from mountainous regions, have become immortalized in folk tales.[7]

On a grand scale peasant armed resistance became a crucial factor in the eastern Ruthenian lands of the Commonwealth, where it combined with Cossack unrest.[7]

The fall of the cities and towns was the most pronounced aspect of the economic breakdown of the Commonwealth. The nascent manifestations of capitalist practices of the Renaissance era were weakened or wiped out, which irreversibly retarded the short- and long-term aspects of economic development in absolute terms or in comparison with Poland's neighbors, or even with Silesia and parts of Pomerania, areas lost by the Crown.[9]

The peasants, who had traditionally constituted a vital part of the town merchants' clientele, now impoverished and forced by their feudal masters to limit their purchases to what was produced or sold within their home estate, largely stopped plying their role in the internal market. The market became confounded further by the monetary crisis, warfare destruction and the fact that some of the most major Poland's and Lithuania's municipal centers were lost to the neighboring states, either permanently or at times of reversals of military fortunes.[9]

The slow rebuilding after 1720 took place unevenly, with some of the largest cities, Warsaw and Danzig (Gdańsk) among them, faring the best, while other like Kraków, reduced to 10 thousand inhabitants, remaining depressed. Most smaller towns suffered badly, except for those in western Greater Poland, where the remarkable ascent of Wschowa took place.[9]

The changes altered the ethnic character of the burgher classes. The peasant influx into towns slowed to a trickle, while the proportion of Jewish inhabitants increased considerably. Of the 750,000 Jews living in the Commonwealth in the middle of the 18th century (other sources give about a million in the 1770s),[10] 3/4 resided in cities, making up almost half of the total urban population. The Jews were very industrious, accepted even marginal profits and soon dominated the crafts and trade, especially in smaller towns. Their communities (Qahal autonomous congregations) conducted extensive credit operations, servicing the Polish middle and upper social strata. Christian townspeople had made at times unsuccessful attempts to limit the commercial rights of the Jews.[9]

Some Polish cities had the de non tolerandis Judaeis ""privilege"", which meant that they were able to exclude Jews from the area under the town's jurisdiction. Many Jews were often still able to remain within city limits, while others lived in jurydykas, areas typically under feudal jurisdiction outside city walls. Jews also lived in shtetls, their own small countryside towns, existing under protection of a feudal lord. Jews usually functioned under the Jewish court system, subject to noble (sejm mandated) courts in case of conflict with municipal authorities or other Christians and in appellate cases. The spatial separation was only partial and in the Commonwealth there were no formal ghettos. Jewish residents of cities participated in the upkeep of public infrastructure, and made other contributions, including to common military defense.[11][12]

The weakness of central government prevented an introduction of a uniform statewide economic policy, even as feeble attempts to implement mercantilism and state protectionism (widely then practiced in Europe) were being made. The balance of trade remained negative most of the time, and the country's transit role diminished. The lack of central controls opened the Commonwealth to exploitation by more advanced economies. The monetary crisis and chaotic policy in that area, as well as Frederick II's flooding of Poland with fake Polish currency, resulted in massive devaluations and economic losses. With the townspeople increasingly employed in agriculture, where there was demand for labor, the guild crafts and manufacturing, the mainstay of the urban middle class, became reduced to a fraction of its past capacity. However, the Commonwealth was able to preserve or rebuild much of the mining, metallurgy and heavier industries, some of which were important for military applications.[9]

Nationwide the urban classes had become marginalized and lacked influence, as even by the end of the 18th century the population of town residents constituted no more than 15% of the Commonwealth total. Most cities were private, as opposed to ""royal"" or public, with their inhabitants accordingly subjected to arbitrary obligations imposed by feudal owners. In the 18th century royal city of Kraków, 55% of the grounds within the city walls belonged to the Church, 17% to nobility interests and only the rest to the actual city folks. The degradation of towns was recognized as one of the leading factors contributing to national decline by the more enlightened of szlachta publicists (Garczyński, Fredro, Leszczyński).[9]

The Commonwealth city populations were fragmented on the basis of trade, class, ethnicity, religious affiliation or jurisdiction type and consumed by internal conflicts. The most enterprising and successful of burghers were able to join the ranks of nobility, thus leaving the urban occupations or introducing additional tensions within cities. Townspeople in larger cities, including Danzig, supported with dedication and generosity the national cause during the foreign invasions. The Commonwealth's urban upper layer had lost its previously prominent role in the promotion of cultural advancement, but in Silesia, where Polish gentry no longer existed, Protestant townspeople continued Polish language educational and cultural activities, including literary work and publications, in several cities. Toward the middle of the 18th century the Polish and German burghers of Danzig, Thorn (Toruń) and other municipalities of Royal Prussia were among the pioneers of Polish Enlightenment. The typically parochial climate of ignorance, backwardness and prejudice in many small towns found its expression in a number of witch trials. Many magnate residencies were built and public improvement projects completed in Warsaw during the first half of the 18th century.[9]

The first changes indicating an upcoming economic recovery took place in the 1725–50 period. More clearly visible agricultural and industrial progress occurred during the two following decades (1750–70) and had to do with the improved by that time state of the agricultural market in Europe. During the earlier period some technical advances were made and contributed to improved agriculture and, more importantly, the nature of rural social relations was changing. Beginning in Poznań region and then elsewhere in western Greater Poland and Royal Prussia, the manorial serfdom labor requirements were being replaced with peasant land rentals and owners collecting monetary compensation. This ""buying off"" of the forced labor obligations was often favored by the peasants themselves, as it improved their financial situation and reconnected them to city markets.[13]

The same two regions and the capital city of Warsaw experienced also a moderate awakening in the area of industrial activities and urban business enterprises. A major trading house was established in Warsaw by French Huguenots in 1723. Manufacturing businesses were created by a number of magnates in various regions. Among the most important was the developing iron industry in southern and central Poland (Old-Polish Industrial Region). These modest signs of industrial progress occurred within the Commonwealth with a nearly half-century delay not only in comparison to Poland's western and southern neighbors, but also with respect to Russia.[13]

The long-lasting Cossack uprising began in 1648 and was led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky. It was a great national and social movement, as the increasingly exploited Rus' peasant masses joined the Cossacks to fight their szlachta oppressors. Polonization, catholicizing, state support for the Uniate Church (especially in western Ukraine) at the expense of the often persecuted Orthodox religion, and denying the Ukrainian people cultural opportunities were some of the factors that contributed greatly to the unrest. In spite of the suppression, during the first half of the 17th century the Rus' elements in the region matured, consolidated and gained strength at all levels of society. Accordingly, a great majority of the Ukrainian nobility from the Kiev and Bratslav Voivodeships and the Ukrainian urban people joined the uprising as well.[6][14][15][c]

The unusually dry summer of 1648 and locust attacks caused destruction of crops and hunger in Ukraine, adding to the region's instability.[15]

As Władysław IV carried out preparations for the Turkish expedition that he had planned, by the time the Sejm halted the undertaking, large numbers of Cossack warriors had been mobilized and put in a state of military readiness. The appearance of an outstanding leader, a scribe in the Zaporizhian Army of Registered Cossacks, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, was another decisive factor. Having suffered a wrong from Daniel Czapliński, a Polish nobleman, and unable to obtain redress through official channels, Khmelnytsky headed for the Zaporizhian Sich, where he agitated among the Cossacks already embittered by the repressions of the 1630s, and now also made restless by the cancellation of the war they were told to expect. Khmelnytsky effectively caused the Cossack force to change sides. He was able to secure support from the Crimean Khanate, taking advantage of the Tatars' (and their Ottoman overlords')[16] interest in disabling the Commonwealth's offensive military capabilities. The Cossack-Tatar alliance, a new factor in the regional civil warfare, turned out to be militarily highly effective.[14][15]

The disastrous consequences of the erroneous and short-sighted, during the reigns of the first two Vasa kings, Cossack policies of the Polish Republic of Nobility were about to make their impact, first of many. In April and May 1648, in the Battle of Zhovti Vody and the Battle of Korsuń the joined Cossack-Tatar forces completely destroyed the Crown army, capturing Crown Hetmans Mikołaj Potocki and Marcin Kalinowski.[17] Thousands of Registered Cossacks, sent into combat with the Polish forces, were persuaded by the rebels to change sides. As a result of the dramatic events, vast expanses of Dnieper Ukraine became engulfed in the spreading social upheaval and the region's separation from the Polish kingdom had begun.[14][15]

Ukrainian land potentate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki, who embarked on the defense of his huge threatened latifundium and its people, began retreating at the end of May from left-bank Ukraine. Fighting the Cossacks with some measure of success he matched the ruthlessness of the rebels, but brought no resolution to the conflict and prevented a possibility of the considered negotiated solution. Wiśniowiecki commanded his army at the Battle of Starokostiantyniv in late July against Cossack forces led by Maksym Kryvonis; its indecisive outcome allowed Wiśniowiecki and his units to continue their westward movement.[18]

The death of Władysław IV on May 20 and the discordant interregnum had made the matters worse. Chancellor Jerzy Ossoliński and Voivode Adam Kisiel, a magnate influential with the Ukrainian population, advocated making the concessions necessary to placate the Cossacks. Other magnates, especially Wiśniowiecki, Aleksander Koniecpolski and Janusz Radziwiłł, demanded taking whatever radical punitive steps were required to quench the disorder. The convocation sejm was likewise indecisive and the newly appointed military chiefs incompetent, which resulted in a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Pyliavtsi in September. This allowed Khmelnytsky to move toward Lwów and Zamość, while the uprising expanded into Volhynia and Belarus.[14]

The situation made it possible for the self-styled Cossack Hetman Khmelnytsky to influence the royal election, during which John Casimir Vasa was chosen with his support. John Casimir and the peace nobility faction made offers and engaged in fruitless talks with Khmelnytsky, who had withdrawn into Ukraine. In February 1649 in Pereiaslav the self-confident Hetman, now speaking of total liberation of the ""Rus' nation"", negotiated with Adam Kisiel, but only a temporary suspension of hostilities was agreed to. Both sides pursued armaments and in spring military activities were resumed.[14][19]

The Polish units protecting Volhynia under Wiśniowiecki were able to defend their fortified encampment at Zbarazh in July and August against the overwhelming Cossack and Tatar armies. Their situation was getting increasingly desperate when the main Crown forces under King John Casimir approached in a rescue attempt. The King was surprised by the enemy at the Battle of Zboriv, but Ossoliński saved the Polish army by successfully negotiating with İslâm III Giray, the Tatar Khan, who was becoming worried about the Cossacks' growing power. Since the Lithuanian forces under Janusz Radziwiłł also entered the Dnieper region, Khmelnytsky consented to ceasing of hostilities on favorable for him, the Cossacks and the Eastern Orthodox Church conditions negotiated in the Treaty of Zboriv (the Cossack Hetmanate was officially recognized by the Commonwealth).[14]

A period of peace lasted from August 1649 to February 1651, but the Polish side balked at the implementation of the Zboriv agreements and further confrontations became inevitable.[20] Khmelnytsky pursued diplomatic activities and obtained a promise of the Ottoman Empire protection and Moldavia's rule for himself upon swearing a fealty oath to the Sultan in 1650. The Cossack Hetman's emissaries also established contacts with Commonwealth dissidents and disaffected peasants in several regions of the Polish Crown and Silesia.[14]

The Kostka-Napierski Uprising erupted in June 1651 in the Podhale region. The peasant rebels, influenced by Khmelnytsky and his uprising,[21] took over the Czorsztyn castle, from where their leader Napierski issued universals calling on the peasants to throw off their lord's yoke. The insurgency generated limited following and was soon suppressed, its leaders executed. There were also a few other centers of peasant revolt, including one organized by Piotr Grzybowski in Greater Poland.[14]

In February 1651, Hetman Kalinowski advanced against the Cossacks, but suffered heavy losses and withdrew to Kamieniec Podolski; in May he fought his way to Sokal, where he joined the gathering of the Crown army.[20] In June, both the regular army and szlachta's pospolite ruszenie moved decisively against the Tatar-Cossack forces. At the Battle of Berestechko King John Casimir was able to impose on the enemy the site for the confrontation he chose and in heavy fighting destroy the Cossack army, while the fleeing Tatars took Khmelnytsky with them.[14] However, a majority of the Cossack soldiers were saved by one of their outstanding commanders, Ivan Bohun.[22]

Berestechko, ""one of the greatest achievements of the Polish military"", removed the threat to the Commonwealth present since 1648, but brought no resolution to the Ukrainian conflict. The szlachta fighters soon left. Khmelnytsky regrouped and with Tatar reinforcements resumed his military harassment. As the combined Crown and Lithuanian armies were not able to follow up the Berestechko victory in the inconclusive Battle of Bila Tserkva, the two sides signed the Treaty of Bila Tserkva, which reduced the Treaty of Zboriv Cossack gains.[14][22]

With the Sultan's support Hetman Khmelnytsky then attempted to subjugate Moldavia by demanding a marriage of his son Tymofiy to Ruxandra, daughter of Vasile Lupu, the Moldavian ruler connected to the Radziwiłł family. After Vasile's refusal the Hetman sent to Moldavia a strong Cossack-Tatar army. This force was confronted in May 1652 by Hetman Kalinowski and his over ten thousand men Crown army. At the disastrous for the Poles Battle of Batoh most of them, including Kalinowski, were killed.[14]

The marriage did take place, but the Moldavian boyars conspired against the Hospodar. Tymofiy, defending his father-in-law, died at the Polish-Transylvanian siege of Suceava. The main Polish forces led by John Casimir became stuck at a camp near Zhvanets. John Casimir negotiated with the Tatar Khan İslâm Giray again and in December 1653 accepted in the Treaty of Zhvanets the old Treaty of Zboriv's conditions.[14]

The Tatars, concerned with the preservation of the regional balance of power, over all may have saved the Commonwealth, by deciding not to support the Cossacks at crucial junctures. While for the moment they reaped the benefits of their position and actions (the King agreed not to resist the next Tatar slave-taking raids into Poland), for the Poles the Berestechko victory was by that time wasted.[23]

The Commonwealth and Cossack combatants were unable to arrive at a military solution, the Crimean and Ottoman alliances had not been reliable for Bohdan Khmelnytsky, and Ukraine was devastated by five years of warfare. Enslavement of Ukrainians by the Tatar ""allies"", plagues and periods of hunger complemented the destruction and depopulation reached 40% in some regions of the country. The losses caused damage to the cohesiveness of the Cossack army and led to greater pro-Moscow orientation and dependence on the northeastern neighbor. The Cossack hetman turned to his prior concepts of increasing cooperation with Russia (talks with the Tsardom took place already in 1651, but the deal was not consummated at that time because of the Berestechko defeat), the country of more distant common historic tradition, but close linguistic, religious and East Slavic cultural ties with Ukraine. The Cossack leaders expected on the one hand Russia's help in eliminating what was left of the Commonwealth's nobility rule in Ukraine, and broad autonomy for the Cossack state on the other. The Polish reverses in the region convinced Tsar Alexis to abandon his policy of non-involvement and move against the Commonwealth.[14][24][25]

A Russian mission arrived in Pereiaslav in January 1654 and the Cossack council deliberating there accepted (not without grave misgivings and futile attempts to negotiate concessions) the supremacy of the Tsar. The Cossacks were offered an elected hetman post, a sixty thousand registry and possession of landed estates. Khmelnytsky and his entire Zaporizhian army pledged being faithful followers of the Russian ruler and Ukraine was taken under the protection of the Tsardom of Russia. Ukrainians of all ranks gathered, or were compelled to gather in Kiev and other towns to take oath of fealty; part of the secular and Orthodox clergy leaders objected or refused. The actual agreement was finalized in April in Moscow, where the Cossack emissaries managed to convince the Tsardom to accept a majority of the Cossack demands (the degree of Ukrainian autonomy was specified) and obtain the promise of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth.[14][25]

The Cossack hetman and his advisers meant a military alliance to facilitate common fight against Poland, even at the price of losing some of the sovereignty acquired in recent years; to Russia a new avenue for imperial expansion was opened. The Treaty of Pereyaslav, an act of ""unification of Ukraine with Russia"", was from the Commonwealth's point of view an instance of rebellion combined with foreign meddling. It led to a new Russo-Polish war that lasted from 1654 to 1667. Powerful Russian armies entered the Commonwealth and the conflict with the Cossacks became a war with the Tsardom.[14][25]

The Russian plans included not only incorporation of Ukraine, but also recovery of the lands lost by Russia further north. The Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate, worried by the new configuration, were now inclined to support the Commonwealth. With the Tatars the Polish units waged a destructive raid into Ukraine and fought in early 1655 the victorious Battle of Okhmativ against combined Russian and Ukrainian forces. Later that year Khmelnytsky counterattacked, took Lublin and reached the Vistula,[26] but was forced to acknowledge John Casimir's supremacy again when his efforts were thwarted by the Tatars. Until his death in 1657 the Cossack leader, despite the Pereyaslav treaty, conducted independent policy, intent on taking advantage of the calamities that had befallen upon the Commonwealth, but also considered an improvement of the relationship with the great power that he shook up (""fatally wounded"", according to historian Timothy Snyder).[14][27][28]

In the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the first phase of the war with the Tsardom ended with a total defeat of the Commonwealth. At the Battle of Shklow (1654) and the Battle of Shepelevichy the Russians destroyed the small Lithuanian force under Janusz Radziwiłł. The country laid open to the conquerors. Belarusian towns surrendered one after another and in 1654 Smolensk fell after a three-month-long siege. The next year the Russians took Minsk, Grodno (Hrodna) and Vilnius. With the simultaneous Swedish war disasters the Commonwealth had to accede in 1656 to the Truce of Vilnius accord.[14]

The Commonwealth's failure to emancipate the Cossacks led to a shift in the regional balance of power (the Khmelnytsky Uprising marks the turning point)[29] and gave rise to the western expansion of the Russian Empire, which eventually resulted in the loss of the Commonwealth's independent existence.[14][30]

The Khmelnytsky Uprising was the beginning of a long period of internal crisis in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The external situation also deteriorated, because of the increased strength of Sweden, Russia, Prussia and the Ottoman Empire. Being forced to simultaneously fight on the Baltic and Ukrainian fronts, the Commonwealth incurred significant territorial losses, even though for the time being its existence was not realistically threatened. The Commonwealth was regarded by main European states, including France of Louis XIV, as a regional power and valuable partner, necessary component of the European balance of power. This perception was being reinforced by military victories, especially under the Hetman and then King John III Sobieski.[31]

In the decentralized state and treasury, the military potential was hampered by the inefficient fiscal apparatus and insufficient taxation. The Commonwealth in the second half of the 17th century developed huge indebtedness in respect to its own armed forces. Military confederations or rebellions, through which the army ""collected"" its own pay typically from royal and church estates, were getting increasingly common. Hetman Sobieski was unable to follow up his Khotyn victory in part because the unpaid Lithuanian and Crown troops left. The Commonwealth was able to field a 60,000 army (plus the unreliable pospolite ruszenie) at the very most, at times when the Habsburg monarchy or the Tsardom of Russia were capable of an effort twice that size. After the Cossack-Tatar wars and to a lesser degree after 1655, the armed forces had to be rebuilt almost completely.[31]

The Commonwealth forces had a much higher (50%) than in other European, infantry-dominated armies, proportion of cavalry, which was of unrivaled in Europe quality. The infantry was also of high battlefield value. Artillery was well-developed and effective, with nearly two thousand pieces present throughout the country. A majority and increasing proportion of soldiers were now of native, rather foreign origin, with decreasing participation of szlachta, who however monopolized the command and dominated the officer corps. The highest ranks belonged to wealthy magnates, with the notable exception of Stefan Czarniecki, a nobleman of more humble origins. Czarniecki introduced guerrilla warfare with heavy participation of peasant masses. Afterwards the last great Polish battlefield successes were made possible by the universal military talent of Jan Sobieski.[31]

The one major weakness and backwardness of the Commonwealth defenses was the lack of significant system of modern fortifications throughout most of its territory, which allowed the invading armies to inflict damage disproportionate to military effort. The exceptions were the mouth of the Vistula region and the south-east, where there were powerful, even if neglected fortresses, such as the Kamieniec Podolski (Kamianets-Podilskyi) Castle.[31]

The fiscal difficulties affected also the Commonwealth diplomacy and foreign policy. John III kept resident diplomats in several major capitals, but the Sejm imposed limits on what they could undertake. The Sejm also banned long-term resident foreign representations in Warsaw, a prohibition ignored by the papacy and numerous governments. The Sejm itself had rather frequently sent its own missions abroad. The magnates, including top state officials, especially the hetmans, conducted their own foreign activities and at times served foreign powers for their private gain. When French dominated European diplomacy, in Poland the official language was still Latin. The 1684 treaty of Holy League, which ignored the recent Polish military contributions and Polish interests alike, was just one example of the Commonwealth's diplomacy lack of effectiveness.[31]

The Swedish invasion of the Commonwealth, known as the Deluge, took place within the context of the Second Northern War. In 1655 the Commonwealth's survival had become endangered, when the huge federation, already critically weakened by the offensive of the Russians, who occupied most of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and by Khmelnytsky's Cossacks holding fast to the lands they overran in Ukraine, was subjected to a massive attack by Sweden. The Swedish leaders, emboldened by the Peace of Westphalia gains, including the western Duchy of Pomerania,[32] intended precisely to take advantage of Poland's grave difficulties, hoping to easily take over at least Courland and Prussia, and thus to enforce their total domination over the Baltic Sea area.[33]

Worried about the Russian strength and advances in the East Baltic region and toward Livonia, the Swedes blocked their further progress by taking over Dünaburg (Daugavpils). King Charles X Gustav of Sweden was also encouraged by the Polish magnate opposition unhappy with John Casimir's rule; Hieronim Radziejowski, expelled form the Commonwealth by the sejm court, was the magnates' representative in Stockholm. The Commonwealth nobility hoped that acquiring the Swedish monarch's protection, or even accepting his rule, would help them recover the eastern lands lost in the warfare of the past several years.[33]

The Swedish armies entered the Commonwealth from the Pomeranian and Livonian dominions, the Pomeranian force crossing the border under Arvid Wittenberg on July 25. At the Battle of Ujście, Greater Poland's pospolite ruszenie briefly fought, but soon capitulated and sought Charles Gustav's protection for their province. Magnus De la Gardie's army crossed into Lithuania with promises of help in resisting the Russians. Janusz and Bogusław Radziwiłł there accepted the Swedish king's supremacy and on October 20 signed the Union of Kėdainiai treaty, under which Lithuania was to form a union with Sweden, instead of Poland.[33]

Other provinces of the Polish Crown by that time had also surrendered to the King of Sweden. Warsaw did not resist the invaders and was thoroughly plundered. John Casimir fought, but was defeated at the Battle of Żarnów and sought refuge, first in Żywiec district and then in Oberglogau in the Duchy of Oppeln (Opole) in Silesia, outside of the Crown. Kraków was defended with determination for three weeks under Stefan Czarniecki's command, but had to capitulate when a rescue force was crushed by the Swedes in the Battle of Wojnicz. The bulk of the Polish nobility and the armed forces declared loyalty to Charles Gustav.[33]

The Swedes failed to take advantage of the local support and treated the Commonwealth as a conquered country, subjecting it to widespread violence, predatory contributions, ruthlessness and pillage. Spontaneous popular resistance arose first among the peasants, beginning with a skirmish they fought near Myślenice. Partisan groups included also townspeople and szlachta, who disillusioned with Charles Gustav often switched sides and took the lead of the fighting. Krzysztof Żegocki led the uprising in Greater Poland. Carpathian foothills region units were highly successful, liberating Nowy Sącz and many other towns. Lwów (Lviv) and Zamość resisted both the Cossack and the Swedish assaults, similarly Danzig (Gdańsk) and Marienburg in case of the Swedes. Some of the Lithuanian forces, under Paweł Jan Sapieha, had remained faithful to John Casimir. They fought in Podlaskie against the Radziwiłłs and took Tykocin. John Casimir himself still in Silesia, issued a universal calling for national resistance against the Swedes, and then on December 18 embarked on a return trip to Poland. The Commonwealth's remaining ally, Crimean Khan Mehmed IV Giray, who had just defeated Khmelnytsky, was offering help and support.[33]

The Jasna Góra Monastery of the Pauline Fathers in Częstochowa was under siege for several weeks at the end of 1655. The success of the monastery's defense was of great psychological and spiritual importance for the Poles. The defense efforts at Jasna Góra, a great shrine and fortress with a crew of a few hundred volunteers, were led by Prior Augustyn Kordecki. Before the end of the year, as peasant rescue units approached the site, the Swedish forces were compelled to abandon the siege. The Poles at this stage of the war were becoming increasingly effective militarily. They used the attack against the national shrine as a rallying point; it added a religious dimension and zeal (defense of Catholicism and anti-Protestant) to their struggle.[33]

On December 29 the Crown hetmans withdrew their previous support of Charles Gustav and established the Tyszowce military confederation aimed at opposing the Swedish invaders. In January 1656 John Casimir returned from abroad and, impressed by the contributions to the war effort made by Poland's common people, solemnly declared in Lwów his support for relieving the peasantry of unjust obligations.[33]

Charles Gustav concentrated on completing the takeover of Prussia. Thorn (Toruń) surrendered without a fight, Marienburg after resisting the siege. Danzig, supported by the Netherlands, remained unconquered. The Swedish king was able to obtain concessions from Frederick William I, the Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia and vassal of the Commonwealth (in regard to his Prussian rule), who in exchange for Warmia region agreed in Königsberg to become a vassal of Sweden. Charles Gustav then moved south, with the intention of breaking the Polish military opposition.[33]

The Poles were still at a disadvantage facing the Swedish army in the open field, and Czarniecki's forces were defeated at the Battle of Gołąb in February 1656. Afterwards the Polish commander successfully applied guerrilla fighting tactics, harassing the enemy while avoiding engagements with the main army. Charles Gustav was soon forced to abandon the siege of Zamość and the planned attack on Lwów. His attempt to hold off the enemy along the line of the San River was unsuccessful, as his forces were trapped by Czarniecki, Jerzy Lubomirski and Sapieha at the fork formed by the San with the Vistula. When Czarniecki left the site to face and crush at Warka the approaching Swedish rescue force under Margrave Friedrich of Baden, Charles Gustav was able to escape the predicament, but the massive Polish uprising by then seized the initiative and broke the Swedish defenses. Most of Lesser Poland was liberated, except for Kraków, and Greater Poland was also cleared of the Swedes following Czarniecki's and Lubomirski's raid there. At the end of June Warsaw, defended by Wittenberg, was stormed and retaken by the popular forces.[33]

Seeking help the Swedish king made Frederick William an offer of Greater Poland. The combined armies of the two monarchs approached Warsaw and fought at the end of July a three-day heavy battle against Polish and Lithuanian troops aided by the Tatars,[34] won by the Swedish-Brandenburg coalition. Frederick William however soon had to retreat after his duchy was attacked by Polish and Tatar forces. Hetman Gosiewski managed to defeat the combined enemy at the Battle of Prostki, while Czarniecki conducted further clearing activities in Greater Poland followed by a revenge incursion into the Brandenburg March and Farther Pomerania.[33]

The international balance of power was also shifting in favor of the Commonwealth because of the agreement with Russia in fall of 1656, motivated in part by the Tsardom's strategic interest in preventing a collapse of the Polish–Lithuanian state and uncontrolled expansion of Sweden. Not giving up its own claims and gains in the east, Russia moved against the Swedish forces in Livonia, which also facilitated their removal from Lithuania. This new situation forced Charles Gustav to alter his plans of conquering all of Poland and to propose a territorial partitioning scheme, under which the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was to be eliminated altogether and he would be able to keep at least some of Sweden's prospects.[33]

First in the Treaty of Labiau the Swedish king granted sovereign rights in Prussia and possession of Greater Poland to Frederick William. In December 1656 a partition treaty involving several monarchs and other parties was concluded in Radnot in Transylvania.[33]

One of the treaty signatories was George II Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania, whose forces entered the Commonwealth in early 1657 on a pillaging spree, reaching in cooperation with the Swedes as far north as Warsaw and Brest. Rákóczi's initially successful offensive had in the end favorable for Poland consequences, as it led to a new configuration of international interests, which prevented the Treaty of Radnot from being implemented.[33]

The so-far rather indifferent Austrian Commonwealth's ally became worried about a stronger Transylvania threatening its Hungarian possessions, which led to an auxiliary military agreement negotiated with the Commonwealth representatives in Vienna, and an Austrian diplomatic initiative aimed at separating Brandenburg form Sweden. Lubomirski's forces raided Transylvania and retreating Rákóczi was defeated by the Poles and Tatars at Czarny Ostrów in Podolia. The combined Polish and Austrian forces had retaken Kraków. Denmark joined the war against Sweden and became the Commonwealth's ally.[33]

Austrian intermediaries facilitated the decisively important negotiations between Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia and the Commonwealth, which in fall of 1657 resulted in the Treaties of Wehlau-Bromberg. The treaties considerably strengthened the Prussian side, as Frederick William, in return for agreeing to abandon Charles Gustav, became a sovereign ruler in Ducal Prussia, ending the historic dependency of East Prussia upon the Commonwealth.  The Prussian ruler was also a recipient of other, including territorial (Lębork and Bytów fiefs, Draheim Starostwo), privileges. The Prussian estates ended up with a homage obligation when a new duke is inaugurated, and an eternal alliance required a Prussian ruler to provide modest assistance to the Commonwealth in case of war.[33]

Efforts to remove Swedish garrisons from the cities of Royal Prussia and Livonia continued. In 1658 Thorn (Toruń) capitulated after a long siege, but the Swedes kept Marienburg and Elbing (Elbląg) until the end of the war. Charles Gustav moved his main military operation to Denmark. In 1658 a joint Polish-Brandenburg-Austrian expedition into Swedish Pomerania and then Denmark took place. Polish units under Stefan Czarniecki distinguished themselves during the takeover of Alsen Island and the Kolding fortress, and in 1659 in the Battle of Nyborg, where the Swedes suffered a heavy defeat.[33]

France worried about Sweden being removed from the Holy Roman Empire pressed for peace negotiations, which commenced in Oliva near Danzig in the early 1660. The Treaty of Oliva was signed in May, after Charles Gustav's death. The Polish side needed now to preserve strength for the struggle with Russia and the old demarcation line was mostly agreed to, with the Commonwealth keeping Courland and southeastern Livonia, including Daugavpils. The Protestants in Royal Prussia were guaranteed religious freedoms, Frederick William had to return his conquests in Swedish Pomerania to Sweden. John II Casimir relinquished his claims to the Swedish throne.[35] The Treaty of Oliva involved the Commonwealth, Brandenburg and Sweden and was guaranteed by Louis XIV of France.[33]

Frederick William's sovereign takeover met with resistance in the Duchy of Prussia. A nobility faction under Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein and Königsberg burghers led by Hieronymus Roth prepared an armed insurrection. The opposition formed a league in 1662 and appealed to the Commonwealth for assistance. The Commonwealth, preoccupied with the war with Russia and internal unrest in the military, extended no help. Frederick William's forces entered Königsberg and imprisoned the leaders of the rebellion. Von Kalckstein fled to Poland, but in 1670 was captured by a Prussian ruler's representative, taken to the Duchy and executed.[36]

The Deluge's long term deleterious effects included an increase in xenophobic attitudes and intolerance in Poland. The religious minorities, accused of supporting foreign adversaries, were persecuted and pressured to emigrate, in the case of the Polish Brethren forced to leave the country. The international standing of the Commonwealth power had become much diminished, especially (with the loss of control over a major part of Livonia and Eastern Prussia) in the crucially important Baltic Sea region.[33]

The Polish–Lithuanian magnates were preoccupied with the issue of recovery of their old feudal lands in the east, lost to the Cossacks and Russia. There was one more and the most significant, even if belated and in the end botched, attempt to resolve the Cossack conflict in an amicable way, by including Ukraine as a partner in the Commonwealth federation.[37]

After Khmelnytsky's death Ivan Vyhovsky was chosen as the Cossack Hetman. Vyhovsky represented the Cossack upper strata and sought independence from Russia through an alliance with Charles Gustav and then the Commonwealth, where some of the leaders understood and wanted to amend the erroneousness of the past policies. An appropriate treaty was prepared by Yuri Nemyrych,[38] an Arian and the Chamberlain of Kiev, who represented Vyhovski, and on John Casimir's side Stanisław Kazimierz Bieniewski, Voivode of Chernihiv, among others. The Treaty of Hadiach was signed on September 16, 1658.[37]

The provisions of the treaty, and of the proposed union, included the creation of the Duchy of Ruthenia, which, like the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, would have its own state offices and participate in the Commonwealth's Sejm. The Eastern Orthodox Church was to be given equal rights with the Catholic Church, with Orthodox bishops seated in the Senate. Nobility status was to be granted to many better off Cossacks (""...so measured, however, that out of each regiment one hundred can be granted nobility"").[39] But the Cossack register was limited to thirty thousand and with the allowed return of the Polish szlachta to their prewar possessions, many of the ordinary Cossack rebels would have been reduced to feudal peasantry status again. The treaty was reluctantly ratified by the Sejm in May 1659, however with the Cossack negotiated gains substantially reduced,[40] which contributed to the pact's eventual demise, a rejection by the increasingly Moscow-influenced Cossack assembly in September. For the Cossack rank and file, what Vyhovsky had negotiated offered too little and came too late.[25][37][41] The crucial factor that doomed the Hadiach treaty was that the sizable regular Ruthenian nobility (not magnates), which would constitute the principal Ukrainian elite with a strong interest in the establishment of the Duchy of Ruthenia, was after ten years of warfare physically eliminated almost in its entirety.[6]

The Treaty of Hadiach became also a major factor leading to the Commonwealth's renewed warfare with the Tsardom, which considered the accord a violation of the previously agreed truce. The approaching Russian army was defeated at Konotop in July 1659 by Vyhovsky with Polish and Tatar help. During disturbances among the Cossack masses that followed, Jerzy Niemirycz was killed. But Moscow's pressure continued and in the fall Ivan Vyhovsky was forced to give up his hetmanship and was replaced by Yurii Khmelnytsky, Bohdan's son. Khmelnytsky, in an attempt to preserve the unity of Ukraine (the left-bank Cossack regiments had already joined the Russian side), concluded a new Pereyaslav agreement with Russia on October 27. The articles substantially reduced the Ukrainian autonomy and the hetman's authority. The Kiev patriarch became a subordinate of the patriarch of Moscow. Russia's progressive incorporation of all of Ukraine was however prevented by the military developments that followed.[25][37]

Russian armies advanced in 1660. The Commonwealth mustered all its military resources and in Lithuania Stefan Czarniecki and Paweł Jan Sapieha defeated Ivan Khovansky at the Battle of Polonka.[40] The Russians had to abandon the siege of Lachowicze (Lyakhavichy) and withdraw beyond the Berezina River. Vilnius was recovered by the Poles the following year. Of great importance was the Volhynia victory of Jerzy Lubomirski and Stanisław Potocki over Vasily Sheremetev in the Battle of Chudniv in October 1660.[40] Yurii Khmelnytsky, also defeated, agreed there to submit to John Casimir and approved a weaker (for the Cossacks) version of the Treaty of Hadiach.[37][40]

The Commonwealth's defense and the retaking of the greater portion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, however successful, had not resulted in the recovery of all the lands lost in the 1650s. Smolensk was left in Russian hands and Ukraine became divided, with the right (western) bank of the Dnieper River (under Yurii Khmelnytsky) tied to the Commonwealth, and the left bank to Russia under the terms of the Pereyaslav treaties. With the Zaporizhian center also conducting its own politics, the whole division of Ukraine resulted in a highly volatile situation and internal warfare, known in Ukrainian history as the Ruin.[37][40] In January 1663 in Chyhyryn the pro-Polish Pavlo Teteria was elected Cossack hetman, but his authority was not recognized in left-bank Ukraine, where in June Ivan Briukhovetsky was chosen with Russian support.[25]

John Casimir made one more attempt to reverse the losses and regain all of Ukraine by attacking the Tsardom in 1663 and 1664. While some of his forward units approached Moscow, fighting the Russian people and weather took its toll, which combined with the internal difficulties at home made the withdrawal unavoidable. The Commonwealth's failures encouraged anti-Polish sentiments in right-bank Ukraine. The popular uprisings there were subdued with great effort,[40] with Hetman Czarniecki dying in the fighting in 1665.[37] The Commonwealth nobility attempted return to their Ukrainian possessions and the warfare caused widespread destruction in Ukraine. In 1665, as the Crown forces were being withdrawn from right-bank Ukraine, the pro-Polish orientation among the Cossacks was greatly diminished and Teteria lost power.[25]

During the Polish–Cossack–Tatar War (1666–71), on Dec. 19, 1666 the new right-bank hetman Petro Doroshenko renewed the Cossack-Tatar alliance and eliminated near Vinnytsia the Polish forces stationed in the region, ending in reality the Polish military rule over Ukraine.[43] In the years that followed, Doroshenko led Cossack fighters and participated in political maneuvers involving the Commonwealth, Russia and the Ottoman Empire in vain pursuit of Khmelnytsky's dream of building a strong Ukrainian state.[25]

Under the pressure of the Ukrainian unrest and the threat of a Turkish–Tatar intervention, the Commonwealth and Russia signed in 1667 an agreement in the village of Andrusovo near Smolensk, according to which eastern Ukraine now belonged to Russia (with a high degree of local autonomy and an internal army). The truce's provisions were favorable to the Tsardom, which, through the territorial gains secured, stopped the Polish eastern expansion and facilitated its own future further movement to the west. The Smolensk, Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi regions were for Poland from now lost, in addition to left-bank Ukraine with Kiev and Zaporizhian Sich (the last entity for a short while remained under joint Russian-Polish supervision).[44] ""Polish Livonia"", the Polotsk and Vitebsk voivodeships and area north of Dünaburg (Latgalia) were to be kept by the Commonwealth.[44] Adjustments were still going to take place, but the eastern and northern Polish–Lithuanian borders had mainly stabilized, until the time of the First Partition.[25][37][44][a][b]

The Ottoman Empire, which had previously been involved in Ukrainian affairs by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, now under the leadership of Sultan Mehmed IV and his Grand Vizier Ahmed Köprülü, interpreted the Ukrainian disorder as an opportunity for its own expansion in the region. The Commonwealth's friend, Tatar Khan Mehmed IV Giray was removed in 1666 and Petro Doroshenko, the Cossack hetman of right-bank Ukraine, seeking the threatened by the Polish-Russian negotiations unity of Ukraine, accepted Ottoman suzerainty. In fall of 1666, the Tatars eliminated the Commonwealth military units present in Dnieper Ukraine, but the 1667 sejm reduced the country's army to 20,000 nevertheless.[45]

In 1667, when Tatar-Cossack forces attacked Lwów (Lviv), Hetman John Sobieski confronted them with a small force. After the Polish troops withstood two weeks of enemy assaults at the Battle of Podhajce (Pidhaitsi), the Tatars agreed to renew the alliance with the Commonwealth and Doroshenko acknowledged its authority.[45]

Soon King John II Casimir Vasa abdicated and was replaced by the helpless Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, which coincided with intense factional infighting within the Commonwealth. Doroshenko's proposal of granting the Cossacks full autonomy in return for Ukraine's association with the Commonwealth was rejected, and a Polish committee nominated Mykhailo Khanenko for Doroshenko's hetman post. Doroshenko appealed for help to the Turks and their Tatar allies, but the Tatars were defeated twice by Sobieski, who in 1671 removed them and Doroshenko from the Bratslav Voivodeship.[45]

At that point, however, the Ottomans, having successfully concluded their war with Venice over Crete, were ready to wage a war on the Commonwealth. The war was officially declared and a great Turkish, Tatar and Cossack invasion force under Mehmed IV entered the Bratslav area and Podolia. The Commonwealth being in a state of internal disorder and incapable of effective defense, the foremost stronghold of Kamieniec Podolski (Kamianets-Podilskyi) capitulated, the Turkish army moved toward Lwów, while the Tatars raided west reaching the San River, taking huge numbers of civilian captives. Sobieski counterattacked moving south from Krasnystaw and freeing 44,000 of the enslaved, but that was not enough to prevent the signing of the Treaty of Buchach in October 1672, on humiliating for the Commonwealth terms. The Ottoman Empire took the Podolian, Bratslav and Kiev voivodeships and accepted a big yearly monetary ""gift"".[45]

This outcome had a sobering effect in Poland. Bickering stopped, the 1673 sejm funded a 50,000 strong army, diplomatic arrangements were made to assure neutrality of the Crimean Khanate and Russian cooperation. Hetman Sobieski's military offensive commenced in the fall.[45]

Sobieski decided to attack the largest of the three Turkish corps, stationed at Khotyn, where another battle with the Ottoman Empire took place half a century earlier. The Battle of Khotyn was won when Sobieski's infantry and cavalry stormed and took over the reinforced enemy positions, at the former camp of Hetman Chodkiewicz. With a broken bridge on the Dniester River, the trapped Ottoman army was destroyed on Nov. 11, 1673. The battle was the greatest by that time land victory over the Ottoman Empire in Europe.[45]

Detrimental to further military progress was the death of King Michał Wiśniowecki. Lithuanian Hetman Michał Pac's refusal to fight under Sobieski's orders forced Sobieski to abandon his intended move toward the Danube. The Polish units that had taken over Jassy in Moldavia were soon forced out by the Turks, who were able to reconnect with their other concentration of troops in Kamieniec Podolski.[45]

John Sobieski, elected in 1674 as King John III, continued the war with Turkey. In 1674 Russia undertook its own military action against the Ottoman Empire and became a subject of a Turkish offensive, aimed at aiding their ally Doroshenko, at that time under Russian siege in Chyhyryn. Sobieski militarily supported Russia, recovering the Bratslav area from the Turks in process. In 1675 Sobieski defeated the Turkish-Tatar forces heading for Lwów, while the Defense of Trembowla and the approaching Polish rescue stopped the enemy's main force, subsequently withdrawn into Moldavia. Another factor contributing to the Ottoman pullout were the successes of the Russians, leading to their takeover of Chyhyryn and subjugation of Doroshenko.[45]

The outcome of the warfare was determined by the campaign of 1676, in conjunction with the negotiations and diplomatic activity that followed. The Ottoman army entered Pokuttya and moving up the Dniester River was confronted by King Sobieski at the Battle of Żurawno. The outnumbered Poles withstood two weeks of enemy assaults, after which a truce was agreed on through French mediation. It had still left Podolia with Kamieniec, Bratslav and other areas in Turkish hands. Ukrainian fortresses had to be given up in light of Ottoman successes in the war with Russia. Therefore, from the Commonwealth point of view, the Żurawno treaty constituted no more than a temporary armistice.[45]

Peace with Turkey was however the aim of John III Sobieski, who, faced with a new situation in Europe after the Treaty of the Pyrenees, wished to pursue an ambitious policy in the more crucial for the Commonwealth Baltic Sea area.[45]

France had become the greatest European power and seeking further hegemony was looking for alliances against its competitors. The Ottoman Empire and Sweden were already important for France as anti-Habsburg components, and the Commonwealth, in peace with Sweden after the Treaty of Oliva, became the next candidate. Poland had however traditionally been linked to Austria, and trying to break this relationship, which had many magnate supporters, filled the time of the reign of Louis XIV.[45]

The pro-French camp was formed in Poland already in the 1660s, in part upon the prodding by Queen Marie Louise, and Jan Sobieski was its member. Their plans of electing a French minded candidate for the Commonwealth crown became frustrated when Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki married Eleonora Maria of Austria. The protracted Polish-Ottoman fighting suited Vienna politicians well, since protected on the southeastern flank by the Commonwealth's involvement, they were able to commit fully to the war with France.[45]

The 1674 election of John Sobieski, married to the French-born Marie Louise, appeared to have strengthened the pro-French faction decisively. A secret Treaty of Yavoriv was signed a year later between the Polish king and Louis XIV, providing for French compensation for a planned war against Frederick William and his Margraviate of Brandenburg, doubled in case of a war also with Austria. Poland was going to cooperate militarily with Sweden and be rewarded in the end with the Duchy of Prussia, possibly also some acquisitions in Silesia.[45]

The French-Polish intentions were to be thwarted by both the international and Commonwealth internal obstacles. Austria and Brandenburg in turn provided funds for the King's rivals to tie his hands. Vienna and Moscow signed their own treaty against Sobieski's policies, in which for the first time the external powers pledged to defend szlachta's ""liberties"", the guarantees of the Commonwealth's weakness. Most importantly the Swedes failed in their military endeavors.[45]

Coming from the west in Pomerania the Swedish forces were defeated and Frederick William took Stettin again. The attempt to take over the Duchy of Prussia fell likewise. In 1677, a secret Polish–Swedish understanding was signed in Danzig, according to which John III agreed to let the Swedes pass through Livonia into Prussia, in addition to strengthening them with his own forces. The Swedish intervention became badly delayed and ended in another defeat. Only Louis XIV's diplomatic activities prevented the Swedes from losing Stettin.[45]

In addition to conducting this last assertive Commonwealth attempt in the Baltic area, John III for a time was also involved in anti-Habsburg diversion in Hungary, engulfed by the Kuruc uprising led by Imre Thököly. The Hungarian rebels were helped with volunteers and supply, and in 1677 with a military expedition led into Hungary by Hieronim Lubomirski.[45]

As the King failed to convince the nobility of the necessity of action in the north, the country's establishment directed its attention back toward the recovery of the lands lost in the east. Russia however was now seen as an ally against the Ottoman power. In order to reclaim the areas lost to Turkey in the south-east and to reestablish influence in Moldavia, John III sought to build a grand European anti-Ottoman league. While his ideas met with cool reception in most European centers of power, except for the papacy and Vienna, Turkey's own military undertakings worked in favor of Sobieski's plans.[48]

Mehmed IV, having concluded in 1681 the war with Russia, was getting ready to take up the defense of Thököly and move against Austria. Facing a choice of leaving the Habsburg state to its own fate or forming with it a coalition to defeat the Ottoman invaders, Sobieski chose the second option, distancing himself from and acting internally against the pro-French camp.[48]

The limited mutual defense alliance with Austria was approved in the Sejm and signed on April 1, 1683. It provided for mutual rescue obligation in the event of an enemy attack on either Kraków or Vienna. Indeed, in July, the over 100,000 strong Ottoman army led by Kara Mustafa Pasha laid a siege to Vienna.[48]

Hieronim Lubomirski had already been fighting the Turks to help Emperor Leopold, and Sobieski quickly marched his 25,000 men to the Vienna battlefield area, where they complemented an allied army of 70,000 total, comprised also of Austrians and Germans. Sobieski took command of the attack on the besiegers and the main battle took place on September 12, 1683. Heavily involved in the fighting were the Commonwealth infantry, artillery and cavalry. Thousands of the Polish Hussar horsemen were famously involved in the victorious assault on Kara Mustafa's camp. The Ottoman offensive capabilities were broken, even though Kara Mustafa was able to save from the rout a portion of his retreating army. Vienna, the gateway to the West, was spared the fate of Constantinople.[48]

The pursuit of the enemy resulted in the two Battles of Párkány. In the first confrontation Sobieski was subjected to a surprise attack, and only two days later, on October 9, together with the Austrians, the Poles destroyed the Turkish army defending the north Hungarian Ottoman possessions.[48]

At this juncture, a protectorate by the Commonwealth was sought by the leaders of Hungary, Transylvania and Moldavia. Actively pursuing these relations would require confronting the Habsburg Monarchy. Not willing or able to do so, King John III decided to join the Holy League (1684), an anti-Ottoman alliance and the last European crusade project, consisting also of the papal state, Venice and the Holy Roman Empire. The pact's basic goals were recovery of the lost territories and common fight until the time of a commonly agreed peace. The Holy League arrangements severely limited the Commonwealth's ability to exercise its options and future reverses can be traced to the failure of the decentralized, ineffective Polish diplomacy to protect through negotiations the country's national interest.[48]

King Sobieski, euphoric after the Vienna victory, lacked a sense of realistic political judgment. Neglecting the recovery of Kamieniec, he unsuccessfully attacked the Turks in Moldavia. Then pressed by the Emperor's and Pope's diplomacies he agreed, to motivate Russia to join the war with the Ottoman Empire, to an ""eternal"" peace treaty with the Tsardom, signed in Moscow in 1686. The treaty confirmed and adjusted further Russia's previous (Truce of Andrusovo) territorial gains, and granted Russia the right to intervene in the Commonwealth to protect the interests of its Eastern Orthodox population. Russia's negotiated obligations fell short of a full anti-Ottoman involvement. In 1686 Russia joined the Holy League.[48]

The decisive reckoning with the Ottoman Empire was supposed to have taken place in 1686, through a coordinated attack of the Holy League allies on the various Ottoman provinces. The coordination turned out to be poor and the large force gathered by John III for a Danube offensive conducted no significant military operations. This and another failed expedition into Moldavia in 1691 mark the twilight of the Commonwealth's military might.[48]

For the rest of his life the ailing king hesitated between a pro-Habsburg and pro-French policy. His son Jakub Ludwik Sobieski married Hedwig of Neuburg, sister of the Empress. Queen Marie Casimire, promoting an alliance with France, signed herself in 1692 a treaty with Louis XIV, but was unable to persuade her husband, who felt bound by the Holy League loyalties,[49] to do likewise.[48]

After Sobieski's death, King Augustus II the Strong attempted another anti-Ottoman Commonwealth campaign, during which only the Battle of Podhajce (1698) was fought. The final Treaty of Karlowitz concluded in 1699 the Holy League's wars with the Ottoman Empire. The Commonwealth ended up recovering Podolia with Kamieniec Podolski and the Bratslav region. The Austrian Habsburg Monarchy, expanded by Hungary and Transylvania, had become the leading Central European power.[48]

After the turn of the century, in Polish Ukraine there was no Ruthenian nobility left (the few survivors of the many wars sought refuge on the left-bank of the Dnieper River) and the right-bank Cossack Hetmanate no longer existed. During the 18th century thousands of Polish szlachta families and hundreds of thousands of Polish peasants arrived and resettled the devastated and depopulated Ukrainian lands. The left-bank Hetmanate fought under Ivan Mazepa, but was ruthlessly pacified by the Russians and eventually destroyed.[6][25]

The wars fought by the Commonwealth during the second half of the 17th century fulfilled their main role of protecting as much as possible of the eastern possessions, where latifundia of the magnates were for the most part located. More comprehensive foreign policy needs were neglected, the functioning of the state had become even more disorganized and the military effort and destruction contributed to further disintegration of the economy.[48]

The reigns of John II Casimir Vasa, Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki and John III Sobieski brought further downgrading and loss of effectiveness of governmental authority, both in the domain of royal control and in the areas of legislative (central and local) ability to function and power. With the diminished fortunes of regular szlachta, the struggle for power and the rather feeble, but still present attempts to reform the system took place within the changing alliances of powerful magnates and royal courts. From the time of John Casimir and his wife Marie Louise, who cared about the well-being of the Commonwealth, but were obsessively preoccupied with the issue of royal succession, the Polish–Lithuanian state was informally divided into a number of territorial domains, practically controlled by regional top feudal lords, inclined to pursue their private and familial interests in the first place.[50]

Janusz Radziwiłł, the most powerful magnate of Lithuania, is credited with being responsible for the first instance of the liberum veto act, which was used to break the deliberations of the sejm of 1652. This widely abused practice eventually led to a paralysis of most of significant legislative activity, and through their szlachta surrogates was used by foreign powers to prevent internal reform in the Commonwealth.[50]

John Casimir's poor relations with the magnates contributed to his initial alienation from the Commonwealth's nobility and armed forces in 1655 at the time of the Swedish Deluge. In 1658 the King, supported by the more patriotic faction of the szlachta, postulated a reform program, which included the introduction of majority voting rules in parliamentary assemblies. The proposal was supported by the Senate in 1658 and considered by the Sejm, which in 1659 established a committee for implementing new procedures, but the reforms soon became a victim of disagreements over the vivente rege and royal succession issues. Although during the sejm of 1661 John Casimir predicted and warned of partition of the Commonwealth by Russia, Brandenburg and Austria if unsettled successions cause significant interregnum periods, by that time the reform program had been defeated and the army remained unpaid.[50]

Hetman Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski was the central figure among the opposition responsible for the defeat of the royal couple's undertakings and attempted reforms. With his inspiration confederations of unpaid soldiers were established in 1661 in the Crown and in Lithuania. The army confederations lasted for two years, forced the parliament to come up with large sums of money, devastated estates and put an end to what was left of the reform processes.[50]

Marie Louise tried to force Lubomirski to leave the country. In 1664 he was accused of high treason and sentenced by the sejm court to banishment, confiscation of property, infamy and removal from state offices held. Lubomirski sought imperial protection in Silesia, where he gathered an army and conducted diplomatic activities aimed at forming an international coalition against the Polish King.[50]

In 1665 Lubomirski entered the Commonwealth in an act of open rebellion known as Lubomirski's Rokosz. The main military confrontation took place in July 1666 near Inowrocław (Battle of Mątwy), where rebel forces slaughtered thousands of the King's best troops. The victory brought no great advantage to Lubomirski, who left the country again and soon died, but John Casimir was obliged to formally abandon his and the Queen's vivente rege election attempts. After the contentious and broken sejm of 1668, the King abdicated and rejected numerous appeals for reconsideration. He still took steps to influence his succession, apologized for his errors (the balance of the reign was clearly negative) and predicted again the ultimate demise of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[50][51]

With the disintegration of the system, and of the functionality of central and local parliamentary assemblies in particular, confederations had assumed an important role, as a substitute but necessary mode of governance. Confederations, which in reality usually constituted more closely knit magnate factions, were temporary (lasting up to several years) associations, whose members were at times pressured into joining, but were sworn and often deeply committed. Confederate decisions were generally made by a majority of votes. All nobility could join, and there was some urban participation. A confederation was led by a marshal and a council and was typically directed against a monarch or aspired to defend the country from foreign oppression.[52]

During the election of 1669 the gathered szlachta unexpectedly flexed their muscle and acted against the leading magnate parties. After the convocation sejm excluded all candidates that in some way had violated the legal process, the rowdy crowd demonstrated its preference for mediocrity by choosing the incompetent and inept Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki. Wiśniowiecki, advised by the Vice-Chancellor, Bishop Andrzej Olszowski, married Eleanor of Austria, who became well regarded for her tenure as the Queen of Poland.[52]

The resulting closer relationship with the Austrian Habsburg state contributed to drawing the Commonwealth to its sphere of alliances and into conflicts with the Ottoman Empire.[53]

Displeased by the growing Austrian influence, the pro-French camp led by Primate Mikołaj Prażmowski and Hetman Jan Sobieski, became very active undermining King Michał's rule.  Liberum veto had become entrenched further when the sejm of 1669 was broken before its statutory term expired. In 1672, after more legislative attempts were thwarted and as the Commonwealth was facing an imminent Ottoman invasion, Prażmowski demanded the King's abdication and Michał responded by calling up pospolite ruszenie turned into the Confederation of Gołąb, ostensibly for the country's defense, but in fact to protect and promote the monarch's faction.[52]

Humiliated by the Treaty of Buchach the Commonwealth faced also a civil war, as Sobieski, dismissed from his office by the Gołąb Confederation, established a competing Confederation of Szczebrzeszyn. After fruitless bickering and the death of the pro-French party's royal candidate, urged by wartime necessities, the two confederations eventually became reconciled in 1673. The accord made possible a common sejm, which was able to come up with the necessary fiscal and military measures.[52]

After Michał Wiśniowiecki's death, the election of 1674 elevated John Sobieski, who because of the recent field successes on the Ottoman front was able to outdistance other early favorites, including Duke Charles of Lorraine. Sobieski was an educated and well-traveled man of many interests and pursuits, son of Jakub Sobieski, an accomplished parliamentarian and diplomat. A great military leader, John III Sobieski became fascinated by the possibility of establishing a natively Polish ruling dynasty, and like his predecessors he allowed the succession issue to consume his attention in vain, at the expense of urgent matters of the deteriorating state.[52]

John III initially intended to implement his various plans, including a conquest of the Duchy of Prussia, succession for his descendants and parliamentary reform, through an alliance with France. Facing determined opposition from the pro-Austrian magnate camp, after 1678 the King abandoned his pro-French policies and collaborators. Deprived as a result of significant domestic support for his projects, Sobieski from 1686 also had to contend with Austria, Brandenburg and Sweden, which agreed to act together to prevent changes in the Polish free election system (Russia and Austria joined in similar understanding already in 1675).[52]

During the sejm of 1688/1689 the King's supporters demanded decisive action against the increasingly bold domestic opposition, but John III was growing weak and refrained from forcefully acting against his enemies and pursuing his aspirations.[52]

The 1691 marriage of Jakub Ludwik Sobieski, the King's eldest son, with Hedwig of Neuburg, resulted in moderate improvement of relations with Vienna.[52]

The last years of the reign of the ailing king saw the disorder, lawlessness, factional infighting and anarchy overcoming the Commonwealth. The monarch was not even able to control the feud between his wife Marie Casimire and their son Jakub. John III's death in 1696 commenced the longest, most contentious and corrupted interregnum in the country's history.[52]

The situation in the Commonwealth had changed to some degree after the election of 1697 and the unexpected ascent of Augustus II the Strong of the House of Wettin, the ruler (as Frederick Augustus I) of the affluent Electorate of Saxony. He invested large sums, obtained foreign support and converted to Catholicism to ensure his election, but the voting process did not give him a clear victory. The early favorite, François Louis, Prince of Conti, had many supporters and was proclaimed a king-elect by the Primate, Michał Stefan Radziejowski. Augustus and his followers acted however more quickly and decisively than the French prince, whose belated arrival in Danzig area, where he sailed, but was blocked by supporters of Augustus from landing in the city,[54] was not enough to prevent the Saxon from gaining the throne. This result was confirmed, after the initial unrest, by the ""pacification sejm"" in 1699.[55]

The personal union of the Commonwealth and Saxony lasted for over half a century, but joined two basically dissimilar political and economic entities, each of which resented the close integration and unification persistently attempted by Augustus. This difficulty naturally checked the ruler's ""absolutist"" tendencies in both states and his pursuit of the Wettin family dynastic domination. The ambitious and able Augustus, who aspired to follow in the footsteps of Louis XIV without regard for the practical limitations of his particular situation, weakened by his adventurous undertakings both Poland and Saxony.[55]

Augustus II stationed the powerful Saxon army within the Commonwealth and applied various external pressures in order to alter its political system, which only alienated the Polish nobility and further demoralized the broader society, relegated to watching the corrupt, but unsuccessful at all levels establishment. The Commonwealth military lacked talented commanders and lost its will to fight for a cause, even though during the Northern War it could be up to 50,000 men strong (in addition to the Saxon army of 30,000). After 1717, the radically reduced Polish army had become a neglected rump of its former self. The Commonwealth diplomacy likewise fell into obscurity, in spite of the extensive resident European diplomatic service maintained by Augustus II and staffed mostly by Saxons. The Commonwealth had become a passive participant of European politics, which contrasted with the activist, but unconcerned in this respect Saxon court.[55]

At the outset of his reign Augustus II arrived at an understanding with Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, which allowed the Hohenzollern ruler to take over Elbing (Elbląg) in 1698. The strong negative reaction in the Commonwealth provided one more opportunity for attacking the former Prussian vassal, which might have been Augustus' objective. But the matter was resolved through negotiations and Frederick's withdrawal from the city in 1700, only to be followed by partial reoccupation of the area in 1703.[56][57]

A treaty involving Saxony, Russia and Denmark, through which the signatories sought to recover territories previously appropriated by Sweden, was concluded in 1699 and became a prelude to the Great Northern War. The Danes were worried by the Swedish penetration of Holstein, peace with the Ottoman Empire allowed Peter I of Russia to direct his attention to the north, and Augustus II represented the Polish claim to Livonia, where his protection had been requested by Johann Patkul, a representative of the Livonian nobility.[57]

The hostilities were initiated early in 1700, when the Danes attacked Holstein and Augustus tried to take over Riga by a sudden action. But the Swedish army was prepared and under the exceptional command of Charles XII, a guarantor of Holstein independency along with England and the Netherlands, who soon forced Denmark to accept peace and routed Peter I's larger force at the Battle of Narva. Augustus II, unable to take Riga even after a long siege, wanted to pull out of the war. For Sweden however the union of Saxony and the Commonwealth seemed a strategic and economic threat and Charles demanded that Augustus relinquishes the Polish throne as the condition for peace. The Swedish monarch expected considerable support within the Commonwealth, where in Lithuania the powerful and abusive Sapieha magnate faction was defeated in a civil war (Battle of Valkininkai (Olkieniki) in November 1700) and the oligarchs appealed to Charles for protection and the removal of Augustus.[57]

Charles defeated the Saxon army at a battle near Riga in 1701, took over Courland and entered the Commonwealth, at that time not an official participant of the war. The Swedes took Warsaw and moved toward Kraków, which also fell as the Saxon and Polish forces were beaten at Kliszów in July 1702. Further Saxon defeats took place the following year at Pułtusk and Thorn (Toruń), which split the Commonwealth nobility and intensified the anti-Saxon opposition led by Cardinal Radziejowski. A confederation in Warsaw, based mainly on Greater Poland nobility, was convened, and, following the wishes of Charles XII, proclaimed a dethronement of Augustus on Feb. 14, 1704. On July 12, the election as king of Stanisław Leszczyński, the Voivode of Poznań, took place. It was the first free election in which the outcome was imposed by a foreign ruler, and the chosen, young and well-educated Polish magnate, was completely subservient to Charles. Stanisław's elevation was followed by a country-wide civil war and by the Treaty of Warsaw (1705), aimed at subjugating the Commonwealth to Swedish dominance. The Swedish monarch was granted permanent extensive territorial and other concessions, such as the right to station and conscript troops, and intended to use the Commonwealth's resources  to fight Russia, his main adversary.[57]

The majority of the Polish nobility opposed the Warsaw Confederation and considered Leszczyński's election illegal. The predominant pro-Augustus party convened the Sandomierz Confederation in May 1704 under Stanisław Denhoff as marshal, declaring their intent to defend the King and the integrity of the state and seeking the Tsardom's protection. Accordingly, the Treaty of Narva was concluded on August 30, 1704 in the recently won by the Russians Narva, with the purpose of facilitating a common front against Sweden, giving Russia the right to fight Swedish armies on the Commonwealth's territory. The Commonwealth was promised a (never realized) recovery of Livonia and the Tsardom obliged itself to help in suppressing the Cossack uprising of Semen Paliy in the right-bank Ukraine, but the treaty opened opportunities for Russia's future involvement in the affairs of the Commonwealth.[57]

The developments on the military front did not however proceed as hoped for by the pro-Saxon majority. The common Russian-Saxon-Polish offensive had failed, as Charles forced the Russians to abandon Grodno and the Saxon-led coalition army was defeated in 1706 at the Battle of Fraustadt. As a result of the favorable for him outcomes at the War of the Spanish Succession, Charles XII was able to enter the Holy Roman Empire and occupied Saxony. Augustus II had to agree to humiliating terms of the Treaty of Altranstädt of 1706, in which he renounced the Polish crown.[57]

Prior to the treaty ratification, Augustus still managed to defeat at Kalisz a combined Swedish and Warsaw Confederation force, which left most of the Commonwealth clear of the Swedish occupiers, until Charles entered through Silesia again. The Sandomierz Confederation held to their alliance with Peter I of Russia also during the Charles' Moscow offensive, when the Russian troops left Poland. Stanisław Leszczyński's forces, charged with protecting the rear end, were defeated by his and Charles' Polish adversaries at the Battle of Koniecpol. Stanisław and von Krassow (commander of the Swedish units left in Poland), thwarted by the Sandomierz confederates again, were unable to break through to join Charles who was stuck in Ukraine, where the Cossack hetman Ivan Mazepa largely failed to deliver on his promised support for the Swedes.[58] The Swedish supply train approaching from Livonia was destroyed by the Russians, and thus the actions of the Sandomierz Confederation alliance significantly contributed to Charles' ultimate failure at the Battle of Poltava in 1709.[57]

After Poltava von Krassow and his forces withdrew to Swedish Pomerania and the rule of Augustus II was restored, as Leszczyński sought refuge in Swedish-controlled Stettin. Charles XII found his in Bender, under the Ottoman rule, and was still a cause of unrest in the Commonwealth. The Russo-Turkish War (1710–11), instigated by Charles, ended in the defeat of Tsar Peter, who was obliged to remove his forces from the Commonwealth. Augustus' expeditions into Western Pomerania in 1711–13 with the Danes and Russians resulted only in the Prussian takeover of Stettin.[57]

Under the circumstances Augustus wanted to terminate his participation in the war and free himself from his dependence on Peter I, previously formalized under the Treaty of Thorn of 1709, but achieved only a partial success. Attempts at peace with Sweden, which would strengthen Augustus' hand in dealing with Peter, turned also elusive, as Charles XII kept making excessive demands, including high reparations for Leszczyński. Resumption of hostilities necessarily followed, because Charles, having returned from his exile, embarked on building of an army in Stralsund, threatening Saxony and Poland. A siege of Stralsund (1711–15), undertaken jointly by the forces of Saxony, Prussia and Denmark, ended in its capture and basically concluded the Saxon participation in the war. Saxony-Commonwealth ended up as the only power in the victorious coalition with no territorial gains.[57][59]

The activities of Augustus II were aimed at strengthening his royal power in the Commonwealth. Nobility's opposition to the stationing of Saxon troops in Poland, its cost and internally threatening role, led to military resistance, first attempted in 1714 and then in a more definitive way pursued in 1715, when the action unified the pro-Swedish and pro-Russian camps and Peter I's support was secured. In the fall the Crown army became organized in an anti-Saxon capacity and fighting commenced, with large scale participation not only of szlachta, but also of the oppressed by military contributions peasants. In November, the Tarnogród Confederation, with Stanisław Ledóchowski as its marshal was formed, having the goal of removing the Saxons from the Commonwealth.[60]

The spreading movement, unable to fulfill its mission alone, requested mediation by Peter I. Augustus agreed and several months of negotiations facilitated by the Russian ambassador followed, with the fighting still intermittently taking place. Eventually Augustus asked for an intervention by Russian forces, the confederates were defeated by the Saxons at the Battle of Kowalewo, and on November 3, 1716 a treaty between the King and the Polish nobility was signed in Warsaw. The treaty was ratified by the one-day Silent Sejm of Feb. 1, 1717, so called because no debate was allowed. The outcome was a compromise arrived by the negotiating representatives of the King and of the Tarnogród Confederation, but the Tsardom's mediation and supervision marked a turning point in the Polish-Russian relations.[60]

The Treaty of Warsaw and the Silent Sejm settled numerous contentious issues and resulted in limited reform of the state, encompassing a part of what was demanded by the more enlightened szlachta political publicists (Stanisław Szczuka, Stanisław Dunin-Karwicki). Poland-Saxony relationship was strictly limited to a personal union. Saxon ministers were barred from ruling on matters concerning the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The King was to be able to keep only 1200 personal guard Saxon soldiers and was not allowed to reside in Saxony for prolonged periods.[60]

The Commonwealth military force was practically limited to 18,000 soldiers, but was secured by permanent taxing arrangements. The state budget, while enlarged, was set at only a fraction of that of Russia or Prussia. Hetman level chief military commanders had their privileges reduced. Limitations were also imposed on legal competence of regional sejmik assemblies, which turned out to be difficult to implement because of continuous inadequacy of central sejm.[60]

The reversals suffered by Poland and Saxony in the course of the Great Northern War reflected a new configuration of forces in Europe and were of lasting nature, of which the contemporaries were not immediately aware. Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and George I of Great Britain worked out an alliance with Augustus II in Vienna in 1719, aimed at checking the expansion of imperial Russia, but requiring participation of the Commonwealth. Peter I, however, cooperated with the Commonwealth by withdrawing his forces that same year and accordingly the Sejm would not ratify the treaty. Augustus was still able to largely free himself from Peter's protectorate, but in return was excluded from the Treaty of Nystad negotiations, which concluded the war in 1721. Russia took Livonia and the Commonwealth no longer shared a border with Sweden. In real terms, Poland, besides Sweden, was the main victim of the war, because of the damage inflicted on its population, economy, degree of independence, ability to function politically and potential for self-defense.[60]

The last fifteen years of the rule of Augustus II the Strong was characterized by the continuation of magnate factions' private pursuits, but also by the arrival of long-awaited peace and the formation of the Commonwealth's reformist camp. Augustus II, after 1717 having his most ambitious or extreme undertakings curtailed, concentrated on ensuring the Polish succession for his son Friedrich August, which was opposed both domestically and by foreign powers. Augustus was seeking the support of Austria and had imperial political ambitions. Son Frederick Augustus converted to Catholicism and in 1719 married Maria Josepha, daughter of Emperor Joseph I.[61]

In the Commonwealth Augustus was frustrated by the dogged opposition of the Crown Hetman Adam Sieniawski and Lithuanian Hetman Ludwik Pociej, who fought the royal court, themselves  protected by Tsar Peter. They broke successive parliamentary sessions and by 1724 forced the King to remove his trusted minister, Jacob Heinrich von Flemming, from the command of a key military formation.[61]

At this point Augustus was able to use the Tumult of Thorn (Toruń) to his political advantage. The tumult was a religious disturbance and confrontation involving Catholics and Protestants (Lutherans), followed by a verdict of the state court, which sentenced ten Protestants to death. The affair reflected general deterioration of religious tolerance in the Commonwealth, was widely condemned abroad and only the death of Peter I prevented a foreign military intervention prepared in response, with the participation of Frederick William I of Prussia. Augustus refused to intercede on behalf of the condemned and his standing among the unrepentant and unyielding szlachta improved. Subsequent efforts to normalize Poland's foreign relations came to an end when the Commonwealth became engulfed in factional fighting, of which the two recently formed great rival magnate camps, led respectively by the Czartoryski family and the Potocki family, were the main participants.[61]

The party of the newly-prominent Czartoryskis, known as the Familia, expressed patriotic concerns, displayed political activism, was of modern outlook and was connected to Augustus II. Its powerful members included August Aleksander Czartoryski, Fryderyk Michał Czartoryski and Stanisław Poniatowski, a highly accomplished general and diplomat, formerly in the service of Charles XII of Sweden.[61]

The Potockis camp attempted to counteract the rise of the Familia and united the majority of historically most outstanding families, including the Lithuanian clans of the Radziwiłłs, Sapiehas and Ogińskis; among their leaders were Józef Potocki and Teodor Andrzej Potocki, the Primate. The partisan, ruthless competition for top offices prevented central parliamentary function toward the end of the rule of Augustus II. Stanisław Konarski, a prominent pioneering reformer, condemned the breaking of the Sejm proceedings and defended the Familia's point of view in his debut as a publicist in 1732 (Conversation of a Country Gentleman with His Neighbor).[61]

Augustus II counted on the Familia's support regarding the Polish succession of his son Frederick Augustus, but as Louis XV of France married Marie Leszczyńska, the chances of her father, the former king of short duration Stanisław Leszczyński, kept increasing, until he gained the support of both magnate camps and of much of szlachta's rank and file. But the powers which surrounded the Commonwealth opposed both candidacies. In order to control the situation within their weak Polish neighbor they concluded several pacts, beginning in 1720 in Potsdam between Russia and Prussia, which culminated with the Treaty of the Three Black Eagles of 1732. This treaty involved also Austria and designated Infante Manuel, Count of Ourém of Portugal to be the future king of Poland. Augustus II's last minute desperate machinations and schemes were interrupted by his death on February 1, 1733.[61]

A large majority of the Polish nobility, in a rare show of unity, elected Leszczyński on September 12, 1733. The former king however lacked strong support even from France and had to sneak into Warsaw in disguise.[61]

The Saxon court in the meantime was able to arrive at an understanding with St. Petersburg and Vienna, and through the concessions extended, including giving up Courland for Ernst Johann von Biron, a favorite of Tsaritsa Anna of Russia, secured their support in the secret Löwenwolde Treaty.[62] Willing Polish nobles were found,[63] Russian soldiers were brought in and the Wettin was ""elected"" as Augustus III on October 5. The crown of the Commonwealth, in dispute again, was to be decided through the force of arms.[61]

Frederick Augustus' army entered the Commonwealth and took Kraków, where his crowning took place in January 1734. Stanisław Leszczyński went to Danzig, where he waited in vain for serious help from France. The city itself supported him, and surrounded by the Russian and Saxon forces, put up a brave defense for four months, but when the attempted rescue by the Crown army was thwarted by the Russians, Danzig had to surrender on May 29, 1734.[61]

Leszczyński's supporters captured there were forced to recognize Augustus, while the King himself escaped and found refuge in Prussia under the protection of Frederick William. From Königsberg Stanisław issued a manifesto in November 1734, in response to which the Dzików Confederation was set up near Tarnobrzeg, under Adam Tarło as its marshal. The confederates mustered up armed resistance, dedicated to the defense of the Commonwealth's integrity and independence, but the forces of Russia and Saxony encountered no great difficulty in eliminating their units.[61]

France, victorious over Austria in the West, lost its (never very strong) interest in supporting Stanisław Leszczyński and signed an armistice in Vienna in 1735, which became a peace treaty there in 1738. Leszczyński had to relinquish the Polish crown and was compensated with the Duchy of Lorraine, as his fief for life.[61]

In the Commonwealth the situation stabilized with the Pacification Sejm of 1736, which finally assigned top state offices, to Józef Potocki (the Crown Hetman) and the main electors of Augustus. The foreign forces left the Commonwealth, but its sovereignty remained badly compromised and the Polish nobility in reality had lost its most cherished privilege, the free election of the country's monarchs.[61]

Augustus III's deteriorating health caused him eventually to give up and transfer political activity to his powerful courtiers, including Minister Heinrich von Brühl and Marshal Jerzy Mniszech. After 1754 Augustus' court supported reformist activities of the Familia, still involved in the infighting of the magnate parties. Saxon defeats in the Seven Years' War that followed caused complete political stagnation of the Dresden court and its Polish supporters camp.[64]

The internal political fight was influenced by the early Enlightenment ideology and the awareness of the deteriorated condition of the Polish–Lithuanian state. The necessity of reforms, including urgent social issues such as economic and political empowerment of the urban classes and personal freedom for the peasantry, was being addressed in numerous written works. Stanisław Konarski embarked on an educational reform, Stanisław Poniatowski's publication (Letter of a Country Gentleman to a Certain Friend) expounded the comprehensive reform program of the Czartoryski party, including a promotion of mercantilism and economic development, before the sejm of 1744.  Antoni Potocki of the competing camp likewise postulated fundamental internal reforms.[64]

The magnate factions utilized foreign help: The Potocki group was supported by Prussia of Frederick II, the Familia of the Czartoryskis perceived imperial Russia as the future ultimate arbiter of the Commonwealth's fate. Amidst the domestic bickering and foreign meddling, the indispensable treasury and military reforms had never materialized, despite several apparent opportunities and close calls, most notably at the sejm of 1744. From the 1750s and for the remainder of the reign of Augustus III, the Commonwealth descended into anarchy, corrupt private pursuits and unrestrained violation by foreign forces.[64]

Significant rearrangements were taking place among the powers surrounding the Commonwealth. The now sovereign in the former Ducal Prussia Hohenzollern rulers consolidated their control of the Baltic coast areas also west of the Commonwealth's Royal Prussia and were seeking annexations of parts of Polish Pomerania, including a ""Via Regia"" connection between East Prussia and the western portions of the Kingdom of Prussia. While for the time being Russia prevented the realization of these plans, Frederick II directed his attention to the takeover of Silesia, a region which had been under the Bohemian and Austrian control for several centuries.[64]

Taking advantage of the Habsburg dynastic crisis after the assumption of the throne by Maria Theresa, he invaded Silesia in 1740. The Austrians tried to recover the conquered area, but were defeated at the Battle of Mollwitz and then became preoccupied with the War of the Austrian Succession. The Treaty of Breslau and Treaty of Berlin (1742) gave Prussia the majority of the Silesian territory. Prussia became Poland's only western neighbor and the Prussian advances threatened the (thus far strong) ethnically Polish, often Protestant, Silesian populations with increased Germanization pressures. The Habsburg state had a much better record of tolerating minority cultures than the Hohenzollerns in East Prussia.[64]

The first Silesian war was followed by the second (1744–45), terminated by the Treaty of Dresden, and the third (1756–63). Saxony participated in all three, hoping for a territorial connection with the Commonwealth. The Saxon army, allied with Prussia, was destroyed during Frederick's Olomouc campaign in 1742. For the second (when the Electorate was invaded by Prussia) and the third war Saxony switched to supporting the Habsburgs, seeking unsuccessfully to involve Poland during the sejm of 1744. The Treaty of Warsaw (1745) failed to substantially strengthen Augustus' position in the Commonwealth.[64]

The Seven Years' War brought a demise of the Saxon army, which attacked by the Prussians capitulated at Pirna in 1756; Saxony found itself under Prussian occupation. Despite the far reaching Prussian and Russian expansionist designs, the Treaty of Hubertusburg preserved the territorial status quo in the area in 1763. While the Saxon defeats precluded a continuation (beyond Augustus III) of the Wettin personal union with the Commonwealth, the disarmed and defenseless Rzeczpospolita was ripe for more definite territorial encroachments on the part of the neighboring powers.[64]

The union with Saxony was of beneficial economic and cultural consequences for both participating societies. The Saxons were important in the dissemination of the early Enlightenment intellectual currents in the Commonwealth. Józef Aleksander Jabłonowski, the founder of a scientific society in Leipzig, was one of the Poles active in Saxony. The personal union times were to be remembered as a period of positive Polish-German interactions.[64]

In the realm of culture the 1648–1764 period was dominated by the style of Baroque, with the final decades constituting also the early Enlightenment. The middle of the 18th century was a period of transition between the two. Being a part of the nonhomogeneous European Baroque, the Commonwealth holds a unique, original position. West European elements were blended with Oriental influence and native styles and traditions, all fully combined within the broader regional Sarmatism culture.[65]

Close cultural contacts with Italy, which originated during the Renaissance, had remained strong ever since. Numerous Italian artists worked in the Commonwealth, supported by the royal and magnate courts, while many among the Polish upper nobility traveled to Italy to study, participate in pilgrimages or for sightseeing, and increasingly also to France, to cultivate aristocratic contacts and familiarize themselves with the Western ways of life, at such major centers as Paris or Versailles.[65]

In the 18th century the growing French cultural influence had become dominant, which paralleled the rising political importance of France in Europe and the flowering of its arts and literature. The two queens who were French, Marie Louise and Marie Casimire, contributed greatly to cultural contacts and to the increasingly common family ties between the French and Polish aristocratic circles. The court of Augustus II, himself an admirer of the French and follower of Versailles patterns, strengthened the trend and the French language was by then in common use, but mostly within the magnate class.[65]

German cultural patterns influenced strongly the German and Protestant burghers, especially in Royal Prussia and Poznań area, some of whom were educated at Protestant universities in Germany. The German culture became significant in the 18th century Commonwealth in the context of the personal union with Saxony. Less prevalent, but also present was the influence of other Protestant West European cultures, among which at the earlier stages the Dutch was more significant than English. Jewish burgher circles in the Commonwealth were important in trade and cultural contacts. Some Jews were educated abroad at the few European universities that accepted Jewish candidates.[65][66]

The Eastern influences became clearly discernible and had been increasing throughout the 17th century. The nobility of the Commonwealth developed a preference for Tatar, Turkish, Persian and also East Slavic artistic tastes, which had to do with the wars fought on the Islamic front and the spoils brought back and with the presumed Black Sea shores (Sarmatian) origins of Polish nobles. Literary and linguistic interests were also pursued in that direction.[65][67] Tadeusz Krusiński, a Jesuit missionary, traveled extensively and published in Latin, including a 1733 account of his experience in Persia.[68]

From the early 17th century, the culture of Polish Baroque was ideologically based on Sarmatism and Counter-Reformation, which during that century were fused into one powerful current of Catholic national mission. The Polish, Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobilities were thus reduced to one messianic ""nation"" of common origin, whose calling was the defense of Christianity and freedom in Europe. This uniquely understood role of the ""chosen"" Polish nation was being promoted by the leading writers of the period, including Wacław Potocki and Wespazjan Kochowski, and was to remain a part of the national mystique for a long time. The practical byproducts of this supposedly civic-minded, self-elevating point of view were parochialism, xenophobia, stagnation and intolerance. The Polish Catholic Church had remained likewise nationalistic and intellectually backward until the 18th century, when the reforms of the Council of Trent were belatedly and gradually implemented. The enormous proliferation of monasteries of several orders had at that time little constructive influence on the nation's spiritual life or level of popular education. The witch trials and executions for example, although not as common as in Germany, had been a continuous practice until the middle of the 18th century.[65]

The Polish populace was by and large brought back into the fold of Catholicism during the first half of the 17th century, but anti-Protestant attacks continued. They most often took the form of written Catholic propaganda pamphlets and strict Church censorship of dissenting views. The one clear instance of active persecution undertaken against a religious minority was the expulsion of the Polish Brethren, who during the Swedish Deluge strongly supported King Charles Gustav. The sejm of 1658 sentenced the so-called Arians to banishment, unless they convert to Catholicism. As a result, several hundred families (about five thousand people)[69] left the Commonwealth in 1660, while others, threatened with capital punishment and confiscations, faked conversion, only to subject themselves to further statutory persecution. The Polish Brethren were among the most enlightened segments of the society and their expulsion had strong deleterious effects on the country's intellectual development. Other Protestant denominations remained, at least formally, protected by the rules of the 1573 Warsaw Confederation. Many Silesian Protestants entered the Commonwealth in order to avoid recatholization in the Holy Roman Empire after the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Further restrictions however soon followed.[65]

The ""Arian registry"", established after the sect's exodus, included in reality a variety of cases under religious persecution and prosecution, such atheism or apostasy, official separation from the Church. Apostasy was banned in 1668. From 1673 only Catholics could be granted nobility or indygenat, a recognition (transfer) of foreign nobility status. In 1717, after the Northern War destruction, Protestants were not allowed to restore the structures of their congregations or build new ones. They were banned from holding state offices and removed from central parliament. The discriminatory laws were all collected in the sejm statute of 1733, after which the Commonwealth Protestants no longer enjoyed meaningful political rights. Actual cases of religion-inspired violence, such as the Thorn Tumult of 1724, were rare and considerable freedom of religious practice had prevailed. Non-nobles attracted less scrutiny and many foreign persecuted minorities were allowed to settle in the country and keep their religion. The Orthodox Church hierarchy in the Commonwealth were all forced to accept the Union in the early 18th century.[65]

The much-reduced Protestants remained significant. They cooperated among the several denominations and appealed to the Treaty of Oliva guarantees or to foreign (Prussian, English and Dutch) protection in case of imposed restrictions. The ethnically Polish and culturally active settlement concentrations that had remained in parts of Silesia, Pomerania and Prussia had the burgher Protestant class as their leading component.[65]

The predominance of Sarmatism and Counter-Reformation and the weak cultural development of the Commonwealth were closely related to the lowered, in comparison with the previous period, level of general education. What was left of the school system, destroyed or damaged by wars and lack of interest, concentrated on religious education and cultivating the attachment to szlachta's ""freedoms"". The number of parish schools and secondary schools increased in the 18th century, with more serious reform commencing in the 1840s. Many secondary education colleges were conducted by religious orders of the Jesuits and Piarists. In the early 18th century the illiteracy levels may have ranged from about 28% of upper nobility, to 92% of petty nobility, with over 40% for middle nobility and burghers.[70]

Protestant middle schools fared somewhat better, led by the well regarded gymnasiums in Danzig and Thorn. There were accomplished Polish Protestant schools in Silesia, led by the Pietist school in Teschen and the municipal school in Breslau.[70]

Higher education institutions remained stagnant for a prolonged period of time. Interested young members of the upper nobility or wealthy burghers went to study in Italy or other West European countries. The Jesuit Breslau Academy was established in 1702 and attracted students form the Commonwealth. The existing native institutions in Kraków, Vilnius, Zamość and Lwów taught mostly scholastic theology and philosophy.[70]

Scientific achievements were accordingly generally modest. The one accomplished astronomer was Johannes Hevelius (1611–87) of Danzig, noted for the accurate observations of the sky with the equipment he constructed. Adam A. Kochański and Stanisław Solski were Jesuit mathematicians and astronomers; the latter one was also an engineer.[70]

For history research the most important is the heraldry work The Polish Crown (1740) by Kasper Niesiecki, which provides a wealth of information on Polish szlachta clans.[70]

Social and political thought produced little that was new. Its main representatives in the 17th century were Krzysztof Opaliński, Andrzej Maksymilian Fredro and Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski. They postulated limited social reform. In the early 18th century Stanisław Antoni Szczuka and Stanisław Dunin-Karwicki proposed legislative, treasury and military reforms.[70]

Nowe Ateny (The New Athens), the first encyclopedia published by Benedykt Chmielowski in 1745–46, was not scientifically current. Of the popular agricultural handbooks the most complete was produced by Jakub Kazimierz Haur in 1675. Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny of 1661, the first printed periodical, lasted for a year (41 issues).[71] The first permanent newspaper was Kurier Polski, published from 1729 by the Piarists and then the Jesuits.[70]

The development of literature brought many new genres and themes, with the intended substance of a work often buried within heavy verbiage and other stylistic embellishments. There were hardly any authors ranking with Europe's best. The epic form was predominant, mainly as religious, but also historical or fantasy story telling, in both poetry and prose. The pastoral style was popular, for example in romance, as was lyric poetry in general. Preference was typically given to elaborate form. Publishing material that was original and creative was difficult, because of strict church censorship; many aspiring works had remained in manuscript form only.[72]

Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, a magnate active in royal court circles, represented the conceptismo current. He wrote romantic poetry and expert translations of foreign work. Zbigniew Morsztyn was a soldier and poet connected with the Polish Brethren. He had to spend half of his life in exile in Prussia and produced realistic poetry concerned with the hardships and dangers of military life. Another poet and member of the Polish Brethren, Wacław Potocki, converted to Catholicism. His poetry depicts the life of Polish landed gentry and historic events. He wrote the epic poem The Conduct of the Khotyn War (of 1621) and was deeply troubled by the social injustice in the Commonwealth and its decline. The szlachta apologist Wespazjan Kochowski expressed no such misgivings, but even he could not conceal the progressive degeneration of his class. In the era of constant warfare the writing of memoirs had become an often practiced art. Jan Chryzostom Pasek was one of the leading in Europe representatives of this genre.[72]

Macaronic language, Polish mingled with Latin, was frequently used in writing. The mid 18th century movement to clear Polish from the Latin admixture was led by Stanisław Konarski and Franciszek Bohomolec.[72]

Royal court theater continued under John Casimir, John III, August II and August III. Foreign troupes were brought from Italy (Italian repertoire was the most popular), France and Germany. At least ten magnate-supported theaters functioned in Saxon times, including one at the Ujazdów Castle, where Stanisław Lubomirski staged his comedies, and one at Podhorce, where the historic plays of Hetman Wacław Rzewuski were being shown. School theaters were maintained by the Jesuits, Piarists and Theatines and there were religious spectacles for the general public, including mystery plays, passions and nativity scenes, typically with folk elements.[72]

Music served mostly the needs of the Church and had remained under primarily Italian influence. Pipe organs were brought from abroad and constructed locally; the instrument built in 1682 in Leżajsk is of the highest quality. Many instrumental and vocal ensembles were active at various church institutions. Bartłomiej Pękiel composed polyphonic music including a cappella masses and the first in Poland cantatas. Stanisław Sylwester Szarzyński wrote instrumental music of which only one sonata has survived. Secular (court bands) and folk music was also practiced and the mazurka folk dance crystallized during that period. Foreign operas and ballets were staged in Warsaw under Augustus II and Augustus III.[72]

The finest artistic manifestation of the Baroque in Poland is its architecture, developed under the Italian, Dutch, German and French influence, with a strong local component. The new elaborate residential and religious compounds, or the rebuilding of older, war-damaged structures, were financed by magnates and the Church. St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Vilnius or Church of St. Anthony of Padua at Czerniaków, Warsaw are examples of the Baroque's richly decorative (see stucco) style. Vault or dome painting, subordinate to the overall aesthetic design, compounded the impression by using optical illusion effects. Sculpture also had the primary function of complementing the design of the interiors.[72]

The Krasiński Palace built in Warsaw in the second half of the 17th century by Tylman van Gameren is an impressive monumental structure. Afterwards, however, residential forms more convenient and intimate, while still preserving much of the former grandeur, were given preference. The Wilanów Palace of King John III is an early representative of this trend. The Rococo style was triumphant under the Wettin rulers and the present Saxon Palace in Warsaw was rebuilt by Augustus II in that manner. Numerous magnate residencies, in Warsaw and throughout the country, where the former fortifications were replaced with parks and pavilions, followed the trend.[72]

Gentry manors were built of wood and so were many country churches. Their builders were local and interesting native styles are still represented in extant structures.[72]

Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter was a prominent painter, one of several who worked for John III. Krzysztof Lubieniecki and Teodor Lubieniecki of the Polish Brethren, painted in the West. Szymon Czechowicz represented religious painting in the 18th century. Of particular interest is the Sarmatist portrait painting. Usually anonymous, it often faithfully conveys crucial individual characteristics of ordinary Polish nobles and magnates, even if constrained by its artistic convention. Coffin portraits are an important subcategory of this type.[72]

Even with its civilizational influence diminished, the Commonwealth continued as a medium or conduit of cultural and diplomatic contacts between the West and the East, with the Polish culture and language being of international importance and retaining its attractiveness in a number of foreign (Tatar, Russian, Wallachian, Moldavian, German) circles and uses. This cultural attraction contributed to the Polonization in the 17th century of the majority of Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility of the Commonwealth. The ethnically non-Polish urban classes were much less affected by this process and the peasantry still less, so that the apparent cultural and linguistic uniformity of the country was largely an illusion. The ethnically Polish groups west of the Commonwealth (in Silesia and Pomerania) were often disregarded by the Polish establishment as non-nobles, and their ties with the country of their ethnic origin were getting weaker. These factors made it later difficult for Poles to find their proper place within the process of formation of modern European nations and states.[72]

The Enlightenment currents had been fully developed in Western Europe, especially in England and France, when its ideology and paradigms reached the Commonwealth during the last quarter-century of the union with Saxony period. Augustus II propagated France's culture, while Stanisław Leszczyński its social and philosophical thought. Protestant burghers of Royal Prussia came early under the influence of rationalist philosophy. They and many progressive Polish Catholics followed the Saxons and accepted the moderate rationalism of Christian Wolff and were inspired by it.[73]

The postulated by the Enlightenment thinkers social changes depended on an improved level and wider dissemination of education. The Theatines had few colleges in the Commonwealth, but theirs were the first attempts at school reform in the 1830s. In Lunéville, Lorraine, Stanisław Leszczyński established a corps of cadets, a school for the Polish and local nobility. The most crucial turned out to be the initiative of Stanisław Konarski. The young Piarist taught in schools conducted by his order, went to study and teach in Rome, and upon returning via France, Germany and Austria committed himself to pedagogic, scientific and publicist work. In 1740 he established the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw, a high caliber secondary education institution for nobility youth. The school promoted civic duties through such means as debates and the school theater, for which he wrote a tragedy and where Voltaire's tragedies were shown. Despite many objections from the Jesuits and others, the trend set by the Collegium Nobillium was followed. In 1754 all the Piarist colleges were reformed and the Jesuit schools soon followed. New textbooks and teacher training methods were implemented. In the area of school theater Konarski's work was continued by Franciszek Bohomolec, who, revising the out of dated repertoire, wrote or adapted many comedies.[73]

The bishops Andrzej Stanisław Załuski and Józef Andrzej Załuski became great patrons of science. In 1747 they opened a public library in Warsaw, known as the Załuski Library, one of the largest in Europe. Józef Załuski gathered scientists and charged them with reviving and expanding the Polish scientific and other cultural achievements of the Renaissance era. Foundations were laid for the development of Polish bibliography and many publishing actions were initiated.[73]

Konarski undertook to compile all of the sejm legislative records in his Volumina legum. Andrzej Stanisław Załuski extended his patronage to the most outstanding historian in the Commonwealth, Gottfried Lengnich of Danzig, future teacher of Stanisław Antoni Poniatowski. Lengnich wrote in 1742 Ius publicum Regni Poloniae, an outstanding description of the Polish political system, and a history of Royal Prussia. Related work was done in the first half of the 18th century by a number of researchers in Danzig, Thorn, Elbing and Königsberg. Scientists of German origin were responsible for and catalyzed much of the early scientific revival in the Commonwealth.[73]

Publications and periodicals were increasing in number and served the purpose of educating and informing the public. The earliest ones were published in German and many were intended for foreign consumption, beginning with Lengnich's Polnische Bibliothek in 1718–19. Lorenz Christoph Mizler of Saxony postulated economic innovations and edited and published Poland related periodicals in German in 1753–56 (Warschauer Bibliothek, Acta Litteraria), and in Polish Nowe Wiadomości Ekonomiczne i Uczone (New information economical and learned) in 1758–61. The Polish Patriot by Teodor Bauch of Thorn and Monitor by Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski were the first ""moral"" periodicals, dedicated to the new ideology and ethics.[73]

From the circle of Stanisław Leszczyński came in 1743 (dated 1733) Głos wolny wolność ubezpieczający (A free voice in defense of freedom), with a comprehensive program of political and social reform. The publication advocated personal freedom for peasants and taking steps to secure their greater economic independence. Stefan Garczyński wrote in 1750 The Anatomy of the Polish Commonwealth, where he strongly criticized the social and economic plight of the lower classes and promoted economic policies based on mercantilism.[73]

Of special importance were the writings of Stanisław Konarski. Beyond school reform, he fought over many years for reform of the central government and for moral renewal of the noble class, including lessening of the burdens and improving the lot of non-nobility. In his most important work O skutecznym rad sposobie (On an effective way of councils, 1760–63), he unveiled a far-reaching reform program for the Polish parliamentary system and political reorganization of the Commonwealth, which included aiding the monarch with a permanent governing council.[73][74]

a.^ This compromise deal was not truly accepted by Poles, who thought of eastern Ukraine as being wrongfully taken from its, since the Union of Lublin, mother country; by Russians, who since the Treaty of Pereyaslav though of all of Ukraine as rightfully belonging under the Tsardom's rule; and by Ukrainians, who fought for a country of their own.

b.^ Because of the (completed by the first half of the 18th century) Polonization of Ruthenian aristocracy, the Ukrainian people became deprived of their national elites. The noble clans saw their position initially as being allied with the Polish state, but in time assumed its fundamental membership attributes. Ukrainian intellectual elites were restored only during the later part of the 19th century.[75]

c.^ Before the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the sejmiks of the Kiev Voivodeship and  Bratslav Voivodeship deliberated in the majority Ruthenian language, despite the increasing proportion of the Polish and Lithuanian szlachta settled there. Among the one hundred researched Ruthenian noble families from the region, most were opposed to the Union of Brest and almost all fought under Bohdan Khmelnytsky's command.[6]

d.^ The extreme deterioration of the condition of the Polish and Ruthenian serfs caused the degeneration of their status into a form of slavery, referred to in Polish historiography as wtórna pańszczyzna or wtórne poddaństwo [secondary serfdom]. Peasants were basically free people, capable of upward mobility, until the 15th century. After the early modern precipitous decline, significant improvements in the lives of this large majority of the country's population took place only in the middle and later 19th century, in partitioned Poland.[76]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth_(1648–1764)

2001 Lithuanian census,"The 2001 Lithuania Census was carried out during April 6 - April 16 by the Lithuanian Department of Statistics. The results were published in 2002.[1]

At the period of the census the country was subdivided as follows:

Total population was 3,483,972, of which 2,332,098 were urban dwellers and 1,151,874 were rural dwellers.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Lithuanian_census
Union of Lublin,"The Union of Lublin (Polish: Unia lubelska; Lithuanian: Liublino unija) was signed on 1 July 1569 in Lublin, Poland, and created a single state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest countries in Europe at the time. It replaced the personal union of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with a real union and an elective monarchy, as Sigismund II Augustus, the last of the Jagiellons, remained childless after three marriages. In addition, the autonomy of Royal Prussia was largely abandoned. The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno (1566), became a Polish–Lithuanian condominium.[1]

The Commonwealth was ruled by a single elected monarch who carried out the duties of King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, and governed with a common Senate and parliament (the Sejm). The Union is seen by some as an evolutionary stage in the Polish–Lithuanian alliance and personal union, necessitated also by Lithuania's dangerous position in wars with Russia.[2][3][4]

There were long discussions before signing the union treaty. Lithuanian magnates were afraid of losing much of their power, since the union would make their legal status equal to that of the much more numerous Polish lower nobility. Lithuania had been increasingly on the losing side of the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars, however, and by the second half of the 16th century, it faced the threat of total defeat in the Livonian War and incorporation into the Tsardom of Russia.[citation needed] The Polish nobility (the szlachta), on the other hand, were reluctant to offer more help to Lithuania without receiving anything in exchange (as much as 70% of the taxes collected in Poland in the 1560s went to support Lithuania in its war with Moscow).[5][6] The Polish and Lithuanian elites strengthened personal bonds and had opportunities to plan their united futures during increased military cooperation.[7]

Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, seeing the threat to Lithuania and eventually to Poland, pressed for the union, gradually gaining more followers until he felt enough support to forcibly evict landowners who opposed the transition of territory from Lithuania to Poland.[8] A clear motivation for Sigismund was that he was the last Jagiello and had no children or brothers who could inherit the throne. Therefore, the Union was an attempt to preserve the continuity of his dynasty's work since the personal (but not constitutional) union of Poland and Lithuania as a result of the marriage of Jadwiga and Jogaila. The Union was one of the constitutional changes required to establish a formal elective monarchy, which would simultaneously reign over both domains.[8]

The Sejm met in January 1569, near the Polish town of Lublin, but did not reach an agreement (sejm of 1569 in Lublin [pl]). One of the points of contention was the right of Poles to settle and own land in the Grand Duchy. After most of the Lithuanian delegation under the leadership of Vilnius Voivodeship's Mikołaj ""Rudy"" Radziwiłł left Lublin on 1 March, the king responded by annexing Podlachie, Volhynian, Bracław, and the Kiev Voivodeships to the Crown (on 6 June), with wide approval from the local gentry.[9][10] Those historic lands of Rus' are over half of modern Ukraine and were then a substantial portion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's territory. The Rus' nobles there were eager to capitalise on the economic and political opportunities offered by the Polish sphere, and by and large, they wanted their lands to become a part of the Polish Crown.[11]

The Lithuanians were forced to return to the Sejm under the leadership of Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz (father of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz) and to continue negotiations, using slightly different tactics from those of Radziwiłł. Though the Polish szlachta wanted full incorporation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the Crown, the Lithuanians continued to oppose that and agreed only to a federal state. On 28 June 1569, the last objections were overcome, and on 4 July, an act was accordingly signed by the king at Lublin Castle.[9]

The Union of Lublin was superseded by the Constitution of 3 May 1791, under which the federal Commonwealth was to be transformed into a unitary state by King Stanisław August Poniatowski. The status of semi-federal state was restored by the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations. The constitution was not fully implemented, however, and the Commonwealth was ended with the Partitions of Poland in 1795.

After the Union, the Lithuanian nobles had the same formal rights as the Polish to rule the lands and subjects under their control. However, political advancement in the Catholic-dominated Commonwealth was a different matter.[citation needed]

By the late 15th century, the Polish language was already making rapid inroads among the Lithuanian and Rus' elites.[9] The Lublin Union accelerated the process of Polonization. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant for the Ruthenian nobility, most of whom were initially Ruthenian-speaking and Eastern Orthodox by religion. However the commoners, especially the peasants, continued to speak their own languages and after the Union of Brest converted to Eastern Catholicism.[citation needed]

This eventually created a significant rift between the lower social classes and the nobility in the Lithuanian and Ruthenian areas of the Commonwealth.[11] Some Ruthenian magnates resisted Polonization (like the Ostrogskis) by adhering to Orthodox Christianity, giving generously to the Ruthenian Orthodox Churches and to the Ruthenian schools. However, the pressure of Polonization was harder to resist with each subsequent generation and eventually almost all of the Ruthenian nobility was Polonized.[citation needed]

The Cossack uprisings and foreign interventions led to the partitions of the Commonwealth by Russia, Prussia and Austria in 1772, 1793, and 1795. The Union of Lublin was also temporarily inactive while the Union of Kėdainiai was in effect.[citation needed]

Many historians like Krzysztof Rak consider the Union of Lublin to have created a state similar to the present-day European Union,[12] thus considering the Union (along with the Kalmar Union, the several Acts of Union in the British Isles and other similar treaties) to be a predecessor of the Maastricht Treaty. The former, however, created a state of countries more deeply linked than the present-day European Union.[citation needed]

The union brought about the Polish colonization of Ruthenian lands and increasing enserfment of Ruthenian peasantry by the szlachta.[13][14][15][16] Although the conditions for peasants in the Commonwealth was quite dire, compared to the West (see second serfdom), the peasants in the Commonwealth had more freedom than those in Russia; hence peasants (as well as to a lesser extent nobility and merchants) escaping from Russia to the Commonwealth became a major concern for the Russian government, and was one of the factors ultimately leading to the partitions of Poland.[17]

A common coin, the złoty, was introduced.[citation needed]

Execution of crown lands was not extended to the Grand Duchy.[citation needed]

The Union created one of the largest and most populous states in 17th-century Europe (excluding the states not completely in Europe, i.e. the Russian and Ottoman Empires).[18]

As part of the Union, Lithuania lost Podlaskie, Volhynia, Podolia and Kiev voivodeships to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.[citation needed]

The Statutes of Lithuania declared the laws of the Union that conflicted with them to be unconstitutional. The First Statute of Lithuania was also used in the territories of Lithuania that were annexed by Poland shortly before the Union of Lublin (except for Podlaskie). These conflicts between statutory schemes in Lithuania and Poland persisted for many years, and the Third Statute of Lithuania remained in force in territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania even after partitions, until 1840.

Attempts to limit the power of Lithuanian magnates (especially the Sapieha family) and unify the laws of the Commonwealth led to the koekwacja praw movement, culminating in the koekwacja reforms of the Election Sejm of 1697 (May–June), confirmed in the General Sejm of 1698 (April) in the document Porządek sądzenia spraw w Trybunale Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskego.[19]

Poland provided military aid in the wars after the union of the two entities, which was crucial for the survival of the Grand Duchy.[3] Poland and the Grand Duchy were to have separate military but common defense policies.[citation needed]

The Union of Lublin provided for merger of the two states, though each retained substantial autonomy, with their own army, treasury, laws and administration.[10] Though the countries were in theory equal, the larger Poland became the dominant partner. Due to population differences, Polish deputies outnumbered Lithuanians in the Sejm by 3:1.[10]

There was to be a single ruler for both Poland and the Grand Duchy, freely elected by the nobility of both nations, and crowned as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in Wawel Cathedral, Kraków.[citation needed] The demand of a separate inauguration ceremony of the Grand Duke of Lithuania was raised by the nobles of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (e.g. Mikołaj ""the Red"" Radziwiłł, Eustachy Wołłowicz, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Konstanty Ostrogski) during the negotiations of the Union of Lublin, however it was not officially included into it.[20] Nevertheless, on 29 May 1580, a separate ceremony was held in the Vilnius Cathedral during which bishop Merkelis Giedraitis presented Stephen Báthory (King of Poland since 1 May 1576) a decorated sword and a hat adorned with pearls (both were sanctified by Pope Gregory XIII himself), while this ceremony manifested the sovereignty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and had the meaning of elevation of the new Grand Duke of Lithuania, this way ignoring the stipulations of the Union of Lublin.[21][22][23][24]

A common parliament, the Sejm, held its sessions in Warsaw; it had 114 deputies from the Polish lands and 48 from Lithuania. The Senate had 113 Polish and 27 Lithuanian senators.[citation needed]

Poland and the Grand Duchy were to have a common foreign policy.[citation needed]

The Union of Lublin was Sigismund's greatest achievement and his greatest failure. Although it created one of the largest states in contemporary Europe, one that endured for over 200 years,[25] Sigismund failed to push through the reforms that would have established a workable political system. He hoped to strengthen the monarchy with the support of the lesser nobility, and to balance the power of lesser nobility and magnates. However, while all the nobility in the Commonwealth was in theory equal under the law, the political power of the magnates was not weakened significantly, and in the end they could too often bribe or coerce their lesser brethren.[9] In addition, the royal power continued to wane, and while the neighbouring states continued to evolve into strong, centralized absolute monarchies, the Commonwealth slid with its Golden Liberty into a political anarchy that eventually cost it its very existence.[26]

Following the Żeligowski's Mutiny after which the Lithuania's capital Vilnius Region was occupied and which eventually led to the annexation of it into Republic of Poland in 1922, the Lithuanians formally renounced the 1569 Union of Lublin.[27][28]

Today's Republic of Poland considers itself a successor to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,[29] whereas the interwar Republic of Lithuania viewed the Commonwealth's creation in mostly negative light.[30]

The original act document was included in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2017.[31]

The Lublin Triangle, a regional alliance between Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine, was named in reference to the Union of Lublin.[32]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Lublin
Jonas Basanavičius,"Jonas Basanavičius (pronunciationⓘ, Polish: Jan Basanowicz; 23 November 1851 – 16 February 1927) was an activist and proponent of the Lithuanian National Revival. He participated in every major event leading to the independent Lithuanian state and is often given the informal honorific title of the ""Patriarch of the Nation"" (Lithuanian: tautos patriarchas) for his contributions.

Born to a family of farmers, Basanavičius was to become a priest but instead chose to study medicine at the Moscow Medical Academy. He worked as a doctor from 1880 to 1905 in the Principality of Bulgaria. Despite the long distance, he dedicated substantial effort to the Lithuanian cultural work. He founded the first Lithuanian-language newspaper Aušra (1883), contributed articles on Lithuania to the press, collected samples of Lithuanian folklore (songs, fairy-tales, legends, riddles, etc.) and published them. He was also involved with local Bulgarian politics. He returned to Lithuania in 1905 and immediately joined Lithuanian cultural life. He became chairman of the organizing committee of the 1905 Great Seimas of Vilnius. In 1907, he founded the Lithuanian Scientific Society, a learned society dedicated to Lithuanian history, ethnography, linguistics. Basanavičius became chairman of the society and dedicated the rest of his life to its affairs. In 1917, he was elected by the Vilnius Conference to the Council of Lithuania. He chaired the council's session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918 and was the first to sign it. In the aftermath of World War I, Vilnius changed hands and regimes several times, but Basanavičius refused to leave, safeguarding the city's museums, libraries and archives, and continuing his lifelong research of Lithuanian cultural matters. After Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, Vilnius became part of Poland and Lithuanian activities were censored and limited. Basanavičius' continued presence in the city became a symbol of Lithuanian claims to the bitterly contested Vilnius Region. When he died in 1927, the Lithuanian government declared a five-day mourning period.

Basanavičius was born in the village of Ožkabaliai (Polish: Oszkobole) in the Augustów Governorate of Congress Poland, a client state of the Russian Empire, to a family of Lithuanian farmers. His younger brother Vincas was born in 1861; other children died in childhood. Birth complications prompted his parents, devout Catholics, to pray and promise that they would educate their firstborn to be a priest. Keeping up with the promise, the parents supported a village tutor for local children. There Basanavičius learned basic reading, writing, and arithmetic as well as serving the altar. He further attended an elementary school in Lukšiai. During that time Polish was regarded as the more prestigious language of the nobility and well educated people. Russian was used in state administration, while Lithuanian was used among the peasants. After the Uprising of 1863, Tsarist authorities implemented various Russification policies in an attempt to reduce the influence of Polish language and culture. One of such policies allowed Basanavičius to attend Marijampolė Gymnasium. Before the uprising, a son of a Lithuanian could hardly expect to be admitted to a school catering to Polish nobility. Basanavičius failed his first entrance examinations in 1865, but succeeded a year later.

Basanavičius developed appreciation for the Lithuanian language, culture, and history from local hill forts and his parents, who provided a loving treasure of local songs, legends, stories. This appreciation grew and deepened at the gymnasium where Basanavičius got acquainted with classical authors of Lithuanian history (Maciej Stryjkowski, Alexander Guagnini, Jan Długosz, Marcin Kromer), studied Lithuanian folk songs, read classical poems The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis, Konrad Wallenrod by Adam Mickiewicz, Margier by Władysław Syrokomla, and historical fiction by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski. In 1883, he wrote in Aušra:

But who, we ask, composed all these songs about Lithuania's past, which made famous the name of Polish poetry in Europe? The answer is short: Lithuanians! Adomas Mickevičius, L. Kondratavičius, J. I. Kraševskis, T. Lenartavičius, Kotkis (Chodźko), Adinčius (Odyniec), Asnikis and many other lesser bards had Lithuanian surnames, are Lithuanians, come from Lithuania and Lithuanian blood is pulsating through their veins. If they wrote about the past of their loved Lithuania in a non-Lithuanian language, the Polish influence in Lithuanian affairs is to blame.[2]

He drifted away from religion after reading a critical essay of Life of Jesus by Ernest Renan. Upon graduation in 1873, he managed to persuade his parents to allow him to attend Moscow University and not to send him to the Sejny Priest Seminary.

Basanavičius traveled to Moscow first to study history and philology, but after two semesters he transferred to the Moscow Medical Academy. Again, he benefited from the post-uprising Russification policies. He received one of ten fellowships (360 rubles annually) established for Lithuanian students from Congress Poland. He also supplemented his income by taking up private tutoring, but the living conditions were harsh and that had a lasting impact on his health. Basanavičius actively participated in student affairs, followed developments in Lithuania, and continued his studies of Lithuanian heritage. Collecting data from Rumyantsev and university libraries, he hoped to write a study on Grand Duke Kęstutis. He usually spent his summers in Lithuania, collecting folk songs, fairytales, riddles.

After his graduation in spring 1879, Basanavičius traveled back to Lithuania and had a few patients in Ožkabaliai, Vilkaviškis and Aleksotas. He returned to Moscow in October 1879 hoping to establish his private practice, but soon he accepted a lucrative proposal from the Principality of Bulgaria to become the head of a hospital in Lom Palanka, a town of about 8,000 inhabitants. After arrival in late January 1880, he found a run-down hospital located in a former hotel and energetically took measures to construct a new building, establish outpatient service, and combat perception that the hospital was a place to die rather than to get well. In 1880, the hospital had 522 inpatients and 1,144 outpatients compared to just 19 patients during 1879. The position paid well, expenses were low, so he was able to quickly repay debts and accumulate savings. Basanavičius also wrote medical research articles, liberal political articles supporting Bulgarian politician Petko Karavelov, and cultural articles for Prussian Lithuanian press, including Tilžės Keleivis and Lietuwißka Ceitunga, and academic journal Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft. However, these publications were too much under German control and did not satisfy growing needs of Lithuanian activists. Basanavičius contemplated establishing a truly Lithuanian newspaper.

After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in March 1881, Bulgarian Prince Alexander of Battenberg attempted to crack down on liberal politicians. Afraid of persecution, Basanavičius left Bulgaria in May 1882. He traveled for several months, visiting Belgrade, Vienna, Lithuania, before settling down in Prague in December 1882. There he organized publication of Aušra, the first Lithuanian-language newspaper. The first issue appeared in March 1883 and is often cited as the beginning of the Lithuanian National Revival. Basanavičius directed the editorial policies, while Jurgis Mikšas handled printing in Ragnit in East Prussia. The newspaper then would be smuggled to Lithuania as publication in the Lithuanian language was illegal in the Russian Empire. Basanavičius soon lost editorial control of Aušra to Jonas Šliūpas. His involvement in an illegal publication prevented Basanavičius from returning to Lithuania until 1905.

In Prague, Basanavičius met Gabriela Eleonora Mohl, a Bohemian German, and they married in May 1884. Immediately after the wedding, the couple moved to Bulgaria, where political situation had improved. Basanavičius first found a position in Elena, but managed to return to Lom Palanka in 1885. Life there was marked by a series of hardships. The Serbo-Bulgarian War brought a wave of war casualties to the hospital and a typhus epidemic. Basanavičius became seriously ill with pneumonia and typhus in February 1886. In August 1887, he survived an assassination attempt, but one bullet remained logged under his left shoulder blade for the rest of his life and caused various health issues. His attacker, Alexander Manoilov, served a ten-year sentence but never fully explained his reasoning. On 16 February 1889, Mohl died of tuberculosis that she apparently contracted from her dying mother while still in Prague. The death of his wife sent Basanavičius into depression and melancholy for almost a year.

In 1891, Basanavičius acquired Bulgarian citizenship[3] and was promoted to Varna, a city of 25,000 residents, in 1892, but his health problems intensified. He suffered from arrhythmia, neurasthenia, neuralgia, paraesthesia. That prompted him to resign from public position in 1893 and limit his work to his private practice and palace visits to Ferdinand I of Bulgaria. When Nicholas II of Russia became the new Tsar in 1894, Basanavičius petitioned to be allowed to return to Lithuania but was refused. Basanavičius traveled to Austria several times searching for cures to his ailments. In 1900 he suffered a stroke and traveled to Vienna, where he had an X-ray taken which showed where the assassin's bullet was logged under the bones. Doctors refused to operate to extract it.

Despite his ailments, Basanavičius continued to work both on medical and ethnographic studies and even joined politics. In 1898, he was elected to the Bulgarian Literature Society. He traveled to East Prussia, where he campaigned on behalf of four Prussian Lithuanian candidates to the German Reichstag in the 1898 elections (Jonas Smalakys was elected). He also joined the Democratic Party and was elected to the Varna City Council from 1899 to 1903. He also participated in the party congresses and helped develop the party program on health care. However, his passion remained with Lithuanian language and culture. Despite the long distance, he collected Lithuanian tales and songs and published them in 1898–1905 in Lithuanian American presses in United States. Personally he thought that his most important work was the lifelong thesis that Lithuanians descended from Thracians and Phrygians and therefore were closely related to the Bulgarians. The thesis has not been accepted by other scholars.

Russia lost the Russo-Japanese War and became engulfed in the Revolution of 1905. In Lithuania, the press ban was lifted. Basanavičius, after years of service, was entitled to receive a Bulgarian pension and considered this a good time to return to Lithuania even though he did not have a permission to return. He departed Bulgaria in May 1905 and arrived to Vilnius in August. Immediately he joined activities of Lithuanian activists and promoted the idea of a Lithuanian assembly which would become the Great Seimas of Vilnius.[3] With help from the staff of Vilniaus žinios, a fifteen-member organizing committee was formed and Basanavičius became its chairman. In November 1905, in the name of the organizing committee Basanavičius authored a controversial memorandum to Sergei Witte, Prime Minister of the Russian Empire, which demanded autonomy for Lithuania in the Russian Empire.

Over 2,000 participants gathered on 4–5 December 1905 in Vilnius for the Great Seimas of Vilnius. Basanavičius was elected as its chairman. After loud, passionate, and intense discussions, the Seimas adopted a four-paragraph resolution which declared Tsarist government as Lithuania's most dangerous enemy and demanded autonomy for Lithuania. The resolution also called for passive and peaceful resistance to Tsarist authorities, such as not paying taxes, organizing strikes, boycotting certain products, etc. The autonomy was not achieved and the Tsarist authorities soon reestablished their control, but it laid the groundwork for establishing the independent Lithuanian republic in 1918. Using the energy generated by the Seimas, Basanavičius founded the Lithuanian National Democratic Party (Lithuanian: Tautiškoji lietuvių demokratų partija), the first nationalistic party in Lithuania but it did not gain more prominence.

As Tsarist authorities began investigating the Seimas and questioning its organizers, Basanavičius decided to leave Vilnius and traveled to Saint Petersburg. There he approached Pavel Milyukov, leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party, but found little sympathy for the Lithuanian cause. When he returned in January 1906, the police was waiting for him and he considered fleeing the country, but his Bulgarian passport was expired. The authorities questioned him, but he was not jailed. He managed to renew his passport and even obtain a one-year permit to reside in Russia. Despite his ailments and recurring health problems, Basanavičius wholeheartedly joined the election campaigns to the newly established State Duma of the Russian Empire, wrote extensively for Lithuanian press, campaigned for use of Lithuanian language in Catholic churches, continued his ethnographic research going through various archives and libraries. The issue of language in churches was particularly important to Basanavičius. When Russian authorities expelled Eduard von der Ropp, Bishop of Vilnius, from Vilnius, Basanavičius attempted to organize a delegation to Pope Pius X to convince the pope to replace Ropp with a Lithuanian bishop. That put Basanavičius in sharp conflict with Polish clergy. Basanavičius chaired a commission organizing the first exhibition of Lithuanian art, which was held in January 1907 at Vileišis Palace.

On 7 April 1907, Basanavičius, who contemplated establishing a learned society since the 1880s, formally opened the Lithuanian Scientific Society dedicated to studies of Lithuanian history and language. He was elected as the society's president and the society became the focus of his life. Basanavičius was involved to such a degree that the society was virtually identical with his person. The society published scholarly journal Lietuvių tauta (The Lithuanian Nation) which Basanavičius edited. The society also established a library, archive, and museum. The society was not welcomed by Tsarist authorities, that monitored and restricted its activities. Basanavičius campaigned for the National House, an official headquarters for the society. The society raised enough funds to buy a plot of land, but not enough to construct the house. The society and Basanavičius were criticized by younger scholars as too old-fashioned while Christian clergy attacked it for being too secular, but established new standards and levels of quality of Lithuanian scholarship.

The society organized exhibitions, two most prominent were in 1908 for the 25th anniversary of Aušra and in 1914 for the 10th anniversary of the end of the Lithuanian press ban. The society wanted to publish Lithuanian textbooks, but could not find competent authors for the books. It also planned on publishing a Lithuanian encyclopedia, but editorial disputes and financial difficulties derailed the project. The society established a four-member commission (members were Jonas Jablonskis, Kazimieras Būga, Juozas Balčikonis, and Jurgis Šlapelis) which was tasked with standardizing the Lithuanian language. After great debates, Joblonskis emerged as the leading linguist and his book on Lithuanian syntax was published by the society in 1911. The society actively campaigned against city plans to build a water tower on Gediminas Hill and further damage remains of the historic Vilnius Upper Castle; Basanavičius personally traveled to Saint Petersburg to petition the issue.

During its annual meeting in June 1913, the society decided to send a delegation to United States primarily to raise funds for the National House. It was decided that Basanavičius should go and that Martynas Yčas would accompany him.[4] Basanavičius hesitated, citing his health issues, but agreed.[5] They visited Lithuanian American communities on the East Coast (New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and elsewhere). They were discouraged by lax manners of the Lithuanians, infighting between local communities, and attacks by socialists (for example, Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas wrote to Lithuanian American socialist press urging to boycott the donation drive).[6] Basanavičius deeply resented such attacks as to him loyalty to one's nation far outweighed loyalty to one's class or political views.[7] In total, they visited 84 Lithuanian communities in 120 days and collected $23,799 from some 6,000 donors.[8] The money was not enough to build the National House and it was lost in a Russian bank during World War I.[9]

The exhausting travel schedule further deteriorated Basanavičius' frail health. Observers agreed that he became a lot more passive, more an observer than an active participant. Basanavičius himself recognized that he had trouble speaking, remembering things, was overall weaker.[10] He continued to join various committees and organizations, but he would not automatically become chairman. It seemed that his membership was in honor of his past services rather than in expectation of future accomplishments.[11]

At the outbreak of World War I, Basanavičius was undergoing bladder treatment in Berlin and rushed to Vilnius before the borders closed. He spent the war in Vilnius trying to preserve and protect the holdings of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and organize refugee relief efforts via the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In September 1915, Germans took over Vilnius. Many Lithuanians evacuated deeper into Russia, but Basanavičius remained in the city. Initially, the Ober Ost officials restricted Lithuanian activities and banned their press but became more lenient as the war progressed. Basanavičius concerned himself with the cultural work; for example, he obtained new premises for the library of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in summer 1917 and defended Lithuanian priests who spoke against political activities of Kazimierz Mikołaj Michalkiewicz [pl], administrator of the Vilnius Diocese.[12]

The Germans established the puppet Kingdom of Poland and Basanavičius co-signed several memorandums to German officials informing them of Lithuanian aspirations. He participated in the Vilnius Conference and was elected to the 20-member Council of Lithuania, but his role was more honorary and ceremonial. He formally presented thanks to the German officials for allowing the conference and sent a letter to Pope Benedict XV, but was not one of the active officers of the proceedings.[13] On 11 December 1917, the council adopted an act that was demanded by German Chancellor Georg von Hertling and that called for ""a firm and perpetual bond of alliance"" with Germany.[14] Such concessions to the Germans created a rift in the council and four members – Mykolas Biržiška, Steponas Kairys, Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis – resigned from the council in protest.[15] Chairman Antanas Smetona, who supported the Act of 11 December, temporarily stepped down and Basanavičius chaired the session that adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918.[15] He was the first to sign the Act.[13]

Between January 1919 and October 1920, Vilnius changed hands and political regimes several times, but Basanavičius was little concerned with political turmoil and concentrated on cultural work. He worked with the communist regime of the short-lived Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, particularly the Commissar of Education Vaclovas Biržiška, to obtain funds for the repairs of the history museum.[16] After the city was captured by the Poles in April 1919, Polish officials harassed Lithuanian activists, confiscated the money advanced by the Soviets for the museum, raided premises of the Lithuanian Scientific Society in search for weapons, etc. Basanavičius organized lectures, helped with Lithuanian schools, and continued his cultural research.[17] Balancing between Lithuanian and Polish interests, he refused to participate in the opening of the Stefan Batory University.[18] In early 1920, he once again had to relocate the Lithuanian Scientific Society as the premises granted by the German authorities were returned to previous owners.[19]

In May 1920, Basanavičius together with Mykolas Biržiška, Kristupas Čibiras [lt], and Teofilius Juodvalkis traveled to Kaunas to attend the opening of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania.[19] Basanavičius was greeted as an honored guest and met with many dignitaries and old friends. He also visited the native Ožkabaliai before returning to Vilnius in early June.[20] A month later, in July 1920, the city was captured by the Soviet Union and it was transferred to the Lithuanians according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. But Poland recaptured the city in October 1920 during the staged Żeligowski's Mutiny.[21] Polish authorities limited the membership in the Lithuanian Scientific Society only to the residents of Poland.[22] Polish censorship and restrictions caused great anxiety to Basanavičius who feared that he might get arrested.[23] His refusal to leave the city became a living symbol of the Lithuanian claims to the city.[24] In July–November 1924, Basanavičius again visited Lithuania and received a hero's welcome.[25] On 23 November, a day-long celebration with a special mass, concerts, and lectures for his 75th birthday was held in Kaunas.[26]

Basanavičius fell in his home on 5 February 1927. He refused to go to a hospital until he completed certain writing. At the hospital of the Lithuanian Sanitary Aid Society, he was diagnosed with bladder and lung infections that his body was failing to fight.[27] On 16 February 1927, the 9th anniversary of Lithuania's independence, he discussed matters of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and expressed wishes to attend the independence celebrations.[28] He died that day at 6:50 pm. The Lithuanian government declared five-day mourning and sent a 12-member delegation to his funeral.[27]

Due to the tense relations between the two countries, Poland's approval was uncertain. Despite these concerns, the Polish authorities did not impose any obstacles.[29] The Lithuanian delegation did not travel through Riga, as had been customary for journeys between the two countries, but instead crossed a usually closed border. The Lithuanians arrived at the border station of Zawiasy (now Lazdėnai), where a specially arranged first-class train awaited to transport them to Vilnius.[30] There, they were welcomed by members of the Lithuanian community, Danielius Alseika and Jurgis Šlapelis. Moreover, any Lithuanian citizen who wished to attend the funeral and arrived at the border was also to be allowed entry into Poland.[29]

The Lithuanian delegation included representatives of academia, culture, and politics. Among them were: Mykolas Biržiška, Kazimieras Jokantas, Steponas Kairys, Jonas Vileišis, Fr. Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, Izidorius Tamošaitis, Zigmas Žemaitis, Augustinas Janulaitis, Antanas Sodeika, Vladislava Grigaitienė-Polovinskaitė, and the Bishop of Kaišiadorys, Juozapas Kukta.[30]

Due to the arrival of the Lithuanian delegation, the funeral was postponed to February 21. At 6:00 p.m. on February 20, the body of Basanavičius was transported from the Lithuanian Sanitary Aid Society Clinic to the Vilnius Cathedral. The procession, led by Fr. Antanas Viskantas, passed along Wileńska and Adam Mickiewicz Streets (now Gediminas Avenue). It included not only Lithuanians but also Poles and representatives of other nationalities.[31] The following day at 10:00 a.m., a funeral mass was held at the cathedral, celebrated by the Vilnius Archbishop Romuald Jałbrzykowski. The sermon, delivered first in Lithuanian and then in Polish, was given by Lithuanian priest Petras Kraujalis.[31] The procession then proceeded to the Rassos Cemetery, where the burial took place at 1:30 p.m. Speeches were delivered in order by Danielius Alseika, Mykolas Biržiška, and Jonas Vileišis representing the Lithuanian side, followed by Bronisław Krzyżanowski and Ludwik Abramowicz on the Polish side. Fr. Adam Stankievič spoke on behalf of the Belarusians of Vilnius, and Zalman Reisen on behalf of the Jewish community.[32] After further speeches, the ceremony concluded. At 6:30 p.m., a commemorative event was held in the ""Kakadu"" hall at 5 Dąbrowski Street (now Jakšto Street).[33]

The Lithuanian delegation left Vilnius on February 23 on a specially arranged first-class train. Throughout the visit, both sides avoided political topics, resulting in a friendly and neighborly atmosphere. The domestic and international press viewed the event as a sign of improving relations between the two countries. However, these hopes proved unfounded, as the second half of the year saw a significant deterioration in Lithuanian–Polish relations.[34]

A street in Varna, Bulgaria was named Dr. Basanovich Street (Bulgarian: ул. Д-р Иван Басанович) in his honour. A memorial plaque on Panagyurishte Street, Varna, marks the location of former Basanavičius residence.[35] A memorial plaque was unveiled at Anglická 15, Vinohrady, Prague in December 2013.[36]

Jono Basanavičiaus Street in Palanga, the most popular and biggest summer resort in Lithuania, is named after Jonas Basanavičius, who visited Palanga personally in 1924.[37]

Basanavičius collected Lithuanian folklore, such as songs, fairy-tales, and riddles, and published 14 books during his life. In 1993–2004, folklorists Leonardas Sauka and Kostas Aleksynas organized approximately 7,000 works of folklore collected by Basanavičius and published them in the 15-volume Jonas Basanavičius Folklore Library.[38]

A prominent bust of Dr. Jonas Basanavicius is sited on the lowest level of the Lithuanian Cultural Garden within the Cleveland Cultural Gardens in Rockefeller Park in Cleveland, Ohio. Dedicated in 1936, the bust was a gift of the Lithuanian government. The bust is a copy of an original created by prominent Lithuanian sculptor Jonas Zikaras, whose work championed Lithuanian national identity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Basanavičius

Lithuanians in Russia,"Documented references about Lithuanians in Russia are dated at least by  the 13th century. Throughout modern history there were several occurrences of forced migration of Lithuanians in the interior of Russia. According to the 2010 Russian census, 31,377 (0.023% of the total population of Russia) declared themselves as Lithuanians.[1] According to the 2021 Russian census, 13,230 (0.01%) declared themselves as Lithuanians.[2]

As of 2019[update] Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs listed some 20 Lithuanian associations registered in Russia.[3]

Since at least the 13th century there are records of Lithuanian nobility taking allegiance to principalities in Russian lands and to Russian Tsardom. One of the early cases was Daumantas of Pskov (1240-1299), a Lithuanian prince, who fled to Pskov after his troubles in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[4] Other Lithuanian nobility entered Russian lands by marriage or by changing allegiance during wars.

After the Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, most of Lithuanian lands were incorporated into the Russian Empire and there was economic and educational migration of Lithuanians into Russia proper; a number of prominent Lithuanians stayed in Russia (while many of them returned to Lithuania after receiving education in St. Petersburg and Moscow).

After the Polish November Uprising (1830-1831) and January Uprising (1863–1864), which spread into Lithuania, hundreds of Lithuanian rebels (together with Poles) were exiled to Siberia.

During World War I  a considerable number of Lithuanian refugees (among others) from Northwestern Krai and Suvalki Governorate fled into the interior of Russia.

There were massive Soviet deportations from Lithuania to remote parts of the Soviet Union during the Soviet occupation of Baltic states during World War II. The major actions of this kind were June deportation,  Operation Priboi, Operation Vesna, Operation Osen. The number of deported non-combatants is estimated 130,000. Still more anti-Soviet Lithuanian partisans and political prisoners were placed into Gulag labor camps.[5][6]
After Stalin's death in 1953 the slow process of the release of deported started. About 60,000 Lithuanians returned from the exile and some 30,000 were prohibited to return to Lithuania.[7]

According to the 1989 Soviet census, there were about 40,000 Lithuanians in Siberia alone. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and Lithuania reestablishing its independence in 1990 they started returning to Lithuania in masses. Reasons to remain include mixed families, old age, and poor financial status.[8]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanians_in_Russia
Lithuanian–Soviet War,"The Lithuanian–Soviet War or Lithuanian–Bolshevik War (Lithuanian: karas su bolševikais) was fought between newly independent Lithuania and the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic in the aftermath of World War I. It was part of the larger Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919. The offensive followed the retreat of German troops and sought to establish Soviet republics in Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and link up with the German Revolution.[3] By the end of December 1918 Soviet forces reached Lithuanian borders. Largely unopposed, they occupied one town after another and by the end of January 1919 controlled about two thirds of the Lithuanian territory. In February, the Soviet advance was stopped by Lithuanian and German volunteers, who prevented the Soviets from capturing Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. From April 1919, the Lithuanian war went parallel with the Polish–Soviet War. Poland had territorial claims over Lithuania, especially the Vilnius Region; these tensions spilt over into the Polish–Lithuanian War.

British-Polish historian Norman Davies summarized the situation: ""the German army was supporting the Lithuanian nationalists, the Soviets were supporting the Lithuanian communists and the Polish Army was fighting them all.""[4] In mid-May, the Lithuanian army, now commanded by General Silvestras Žukauskas, began an offensive against the Soviets in Northeastern Lithuania. By mid-June, the Lithuanians reached the Latvian border and cornered the Soviets among lakes and hills near Zarasai, where the Soviets held out until the end of August 1919. The Soviets and Lithuanians, separated by the Daugava River, maintained their fronts until the Battle of Daugavpils in January 1920. As early as September 1919, the Soviets offered to negotiate a peace treaty, but talks began only in May 1920. The Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed on July 12, 1920. Soviet Russia fully recognized independent Lithuania.

Lithuania became part of the Russian Empire after the final partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795. During World War I, Lithuania was occupied by Germany and made part of Ober Ost. On February 16, 1918, the Council of Lithuania declared independence from both Germany and Russia. Three weeks later, the Bolsheviks, encumbered with the Russian Civil War, sued for peace with the Central Powers and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. They renounced Russian claims to Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland.[5] However, the Lithuanians were only allowed minimal autonomy and could not establish de facto independence.[6] That changed when Germany lost the war and signed the Compiègne Armistice of 11 November 1918. Lithuania soon began organizing basic institutions and established its first government led by Augustinas Voldemaras.

On November 13, 1918, the Soviet Russian government renounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which had assured Lithuania's independence.[5] The Bolshevik Western Army followed retreating German troops maintaining a distance of  10–15 kilometres (6.2–9.3 mi) between the two armies.[7] Demoralized Germans often left valuable armaments and other equipment to the Soviets.[8] The Soviets attempted to spread the global proletarian revolution and sought to establish Soviet republics in the region. They saw Baltic states as a barrier or a bridge into Western Europe, where they could join the German and the Hungarian revolutions.[9] By the end of December 1918, Bolshevik forces reached eastern Lithuania.

Augustinas Voldemaras, the first Prime Minister of Lithuania, did not believe that forming the military was a priority and advocated Lithuanian neutrality.[10] He trusted that German mercenaries would protect Lithuania until the upcoming Paris Peace Conference could establish peace.[11] Residents organized local self-defense units to defend themselves from the retreating Germans.[10] The first laws regarding the army were not issued until November 23. Some Lithuanians, who had served in the Russian army during the World War, returned to Lithuania and started organizing battalions in Kaunas, Gardinas, Alytus.[10] They lacked guns, ammunition, and officers.

At the end of December, with the Bolsheviks already in the country, Lithuania was left leaderless. Augustinas Voldemaras, Antanas Smetona, Chairman of the Council of Lithuania, and Martynas Yčas, minister of finance, departed for Germany to ask for financial assistance.[2] General Kiprijonas Kundratavičius, vice minister of defense, suggested a retreat to Gardinas and refused to command the Lithuanian defense.[10] The first cabinet of ministers resigned on December 26, 1918. Mykolas Sleževičius stepped in and organized a new government. On December 29, he issued the first mass appeal in four languages calling for volunteers for the Lithuanian Army.[12] Sleževičius' government adopted a new policy on land reform, which could be summarized in a slogan ""land for those who cultivate it.""[13] It meant the land would be taken from large landowners and redistributed first to the volunteers for free and then to small peasants for a fee.[14] Mobilization of officers was announced only on January 25; about 400 people responded.[12]

In Berlin, Smetona and Yčas signed a loan agreement with Germany for 100 million marks.[13] The money was used primarily to build and supply the army. They further negotiated direct German support in the war against the Soviets. Article 12 of the Compiègne Armistice required the Germans to protect Lithuania from possible Soviet attacks,[15] but Germany was also interested in maintaining its influence in the region and weakening Russia.[16] At first they tried to organize volunteers from the retreating soldiers of the 10th German Army, commanded by General Erich von Falkenhayn. However, the soldiers were tired and demoralized and wanted to return home as soon as possible.[17] Recruitment continued in Germany, especially in Saxony. The volunteers were paid 30 marks per month plus 5 marks per day and had to sign up for three months.[18] The first Saxon volunteers, as they became known, arrived in Kaunas at the beginning of January, but quite a few of them were judged unfit for duty and sent back. By the end of January, German volunteers numbered 4,000.[18] They were unreliable, as the German Revolution increased the popularity of the Spartacus League and Soviet causes. There were several attempts at a coup against the Lithuanian government.[18] These volunteers were stationed in and around Kaunas: Alytus, Jonava, Kėdainiai, and Baisogala.[18]

At first, they were organized into the 46th Saxon Volunteer Division.[18] On February 22, Lieutenant-General Walter von Eberhardt became its commander. In April–May, German forces were reorganized into the South Lithuania Volunteer Brigade, composed of three regiments, (18th, 19th, and 20th) and a separate battalion in Raseiniai.[19] The 18th Regiment fought alongside Lithuanians; the 19th Regiment guarded the Kaunas area and did not participate in battle; the 20th Regiment was stationed in Gardinas and then in Kėdainiai; the separate battalion joined the Bermontians.[18] The Baltische Landeswehr, led by General Rüdiger von der Goltz, organized a coup against the Latvian government and captured Riga. On May 23, the Paris Peace Conference, reacting to these events, asked Germany to withdraw its troops from both Latvia and Lithuania as soon as local forces could defend themselves.[20] The last Saxon Volunteers left Lithuania in mid-July.[21]

On 8 December 1918, a revolutionary government was formed from members of the Communist Party of Lithuania, chaired by Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas.[2] On December 16, the revolutionary government declared the establishment of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. Between 31 December 1918 and 1 January 1919, the German garrison withdrew from Vilnius and passed authority over the city to a local Polish committee, against the pleas of the Lithuanian administration.[22] The Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence, which aligned itself with Poland, took over the posts. The Lithuanian government withdrew to Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania.[23] On January 5, 1919, Vilnius was taken by the Soviets after a five-day fight with Polish paramilitary platoons led by general Władysław Wejtko. Kapsukas and his government arrived in Vilnius from Daugavpils on January 7.[24] On February 27, the Lithuanian SSR was incorporated into the Socialist Soviet Republic of Lithuania and Belorussia or Litbel.

In the occupied territory the Soviets created revolutionary committees and soviets based on structures developed in Russia.[25] Unlike elsewhere, Lithuanian communist organizations were young and had not yet developed a network of supporting local councils.[9] They nationalized commercial institutions and large estates. The land was to be used for collective farming instead of being redistributed to small farmers.[26] The Soviet propagated internationalism and atheism in a country of staunch Catholics and determined nationalists.[25][27] Soviets were supported by the industrial working class, but it was too small in Lithuania.[27] The Soviets demanded large war contributions from captured cities and villages. For example, Panevėžys was required to pay 1,000,000, Utena – 200,000, villagers – 10 rubles.[28] Such policies alienated the local population and contributed to the eventual defeat of the Soviets.[27] For example, in February, Kapsukas sent a telegram to Moscow arguing that conscription of local Lithuanians to the Red Army would only encourage Lithuanians to volunteer for the Lithuanian army.[25]

Soviet troops (about 18,000[29] to 20,000 men[30]) approached the Lithuanian territory on December 12, 1918.[30] About 5,000 of them were Lithuanians.[31] Three divisions were employed: Pskov Division (later renamed as the Lithuanian Division), International Division (later renamed as the 2nd Latvian Rifle Division; included 39th, 41st, 47th, and 60th Regiments), and 17th Division (later renamed as Western Division; included 5th Vilnius Regiment).[28] The divisions did not have a common military commander.[19] Later, more units were sent from Russia. The Soviets also recruited partisan groups behind the front lines.[31] Soviet soldiers were poorly supplied and relied on requisitioning food, horses, and clothes from locals.[25] Lithuania could not offer serious resistance as at the time its army consisted only of about 3,000 untrained volunteers.[32] Only local partisans, armed with weapons acquired from retreating Germans, offered brief resistance.

Red Army captured one town after another: Zarasai and Švenčionys (Dec. 22), Utena (Dec. 23), Rokiškis and Vilnius[33] (Jan. 5), Ukmergė and Panevėžys (Jan. 9), Šiauliai (Jan. 15), Telšiai (Jan. 25).[30] That accounted for about 2⁄3 of the Lithuanian territory. The front somewhat stabilized when Soviet forces were stopped near the Venta River by Latvian and German units (Baltische Landeswehr).[34] Also, Germans slowed down the withdrawal of their troops after the Spartacist uprising was subdued on January 12.[35] Southern Lithuania was a little better protected as Germans retreated from Ukraine through Gardinas. To prevent fights between retreating Germans and the Red Army, the Soviets and Germans signed a treaty on January 18. The treaty drew a temporary demarcation line that went through Daugai, Stakliškės, and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) east of the Kaišiadorys–Jonava–Kėdainiai railway.[36] That barred Bolshevik forces from directly attacking Kaunas, Lithuania's second-largest city. The Red Army would need to encircle Kaunas and attack through Alytus or Kėdainiai. The operation to take Kaunas began on February 7.

Kėdainiai was attacked by the 2nd Rifle Regiment of the Lithuanian (former Pskov) Division (about 1,000 men). Lithuanian forces from Panevėžys, commanded by Jonas Variakojis, and from Kėdainiai numbered only about 200 men.[36] Lithuanians withstood Red Army advance near Kėdainiai and with German support repelled it. On February 8, during the course of a reconnaissance mission, Povilas Lukšys became the first Lithuanian soldier to die in the war.[37] On February 10, joint Lithuanian and German forces captured Šėta and forced the Red Army to retreat. The operation's success lifted the Lithuanian army's morale and prevented the Red Army from encircling Kaunas from the north.[36]

On February 9, Soviet 7th Rifle Regiment (900 men) seized Jieznas, south of Kaunas.[38] The battle of Jieznas lasted three days, and, after the setback of the betrayal by a Russian officer in Lithuanian service, Lithuanians, together with German support, ultimately won on February 13 and liberated Jieznas.[39] The Soviets continued to push for Kaunas. The 3rd and 4th Rifle Regiments (about 2,000 men) attacked Alytus on February 12. Germans did not engage in battle and retreated; not yet fully formed Lithuanian 1st Infantry Regiment could not withstand pressure from the Red Army and had to retreat towards Marijampolė and Prienai.[40] Antanas Juozapavičius, the first Lithuanian officer to die in the wars, was killed during this battle. On the night of February 14–15, German forces and one company of the Lithuanians returned to Alytus and once more liberated the city.[41] Kaunas was defended and the front stabilized for a while. Soviets were ordered to abandon the offensive and maintain a defensive position.[42] This break allowed Lithuanians to better organize and train the volunteers.

Northern Lithuania (Samogitia) was overtaken by the Soviet International Division (about 3,000 men). Its objective was to reach the Baltic Sea and cut off German supplies to Latvians in their war against the Soviets.[43] Local communists were more active in northern Lithuania as the shortest route for Russian prisoners to return to Russia was through Samogitia.[44] Their biggest achievement was forming a 1,000-man Samogitian Regiment, commanded by Feliksas Baltušis-Žemaitis, in the city of Šiauliai. The regiment included Russian POWs, German deserters, and criminals.[45] There were no units of regular Lithuanian army in Samogitia except for partisans in Skuodas, rallied by Povilas Plechavičius and his brother Aleksandras, and in Joniškėlis.[36]

The movement of the Bolsheviks towards East Prussia worried Germany, and they sent volunteers (Brigade Schaulen) commanded by General Rüdiger von der Goltz to free a section of the Libau–Romny Railway line linking Liepāja, Mažeikiai, Radviliškis, and Kėdainiai.[46] It was part of a larger counter-offensive in Latvia.[47] At the end of February, the Lithuanian partisans, supported by German artillery, liberated Mažeikiai and Seda, and pursued the Bolsheviks to Kuršėnai. On February 27, 1919, German volunteers supported by Plechavičius' partisans and Joniškėlis' partisans, defeated the Samogitian Regiment in a battle near Luokė.[45] The regiment disbanded. Before mid-March, the Germans took Kuršėnai, Šiauliai, Radviliškis, Šeduva, Joniškis and stopped.[48] On few occasions, they were aided by Lithuanian partisans and regular units. Joniškėlis' partisans continued to guard the front along the Mūša River.[49] They were later incorporated into regular Lithuanian military.[50]

As the Soviet forces were stopped, the Lithuanian army slowly began preparing itself for an offensive. After the Battle of Kėdainiai, the Panevėžys volunteer regiment had secured its positions and grew in strength.[51] Between mid-February and end of March, it carried out small expeditions into nearby towns. Their main purpose was to demoralize the enemy forces and boost the confidence of locals and Lithuanian volunteers.[52] As a reward for its successful operations, the volunteer regiment was named the Separate Panevėžys Battalion (Lithuanian: Panevėžio atskirasis batalionas) on March 22.[53] Demoralization campaign was successful: the Bolshevik forces stationed in Panevėžys and Kupiškis rebelled and were quelled only by a Red Army division from neighbouring Latvia.[54] The Bolshevik morale underwent deeper declines and, between March 19 and March 24, their forces left Panevėžys. Lithuanian forces entered the city on March 26, but the Red Army retook it on April 4.[55]

The lull between Soviet attacks was used to strengthen and organize the army. On March 5, Lithuanians announced the mobilization of men born in 1887–1889.[2] Lithuanian forces rapidly increased their numbers. By May 3, the official headcount reached 440 officers and 10,729 privates.[56] However, only about half of them were properly trained, armed, and assigned to military units.[56] In February–April, Lithuanian soldiers were actively undergoing training, the chain of command was streamlined, new military units formed. Lithuania also received new shipments of arms and munitions. Soldiers received first uniforms.[57]

The first organized Lithuanian offensive was carried out on April 3–8, 1919. Lithuanians decided to take advantage of large Polish attacks against the Soviets in the area near Gardinas to test enemy strength and liberate Vilnius.[57] The southern group, formed based on the 1st Infantry Regiment and led by Kazys Ladiga, was to attack from Alytus along the Daugai–Valkininkai line.[57] The northern group, formed on the basis on the 2nd Infantry Regiment and led by Juozas Butkus, was to attack from Kaišiadorys along the Žasliai–Vievis line.[57] Germans did not participate. Both regiments were initially successful, but the Soviets gathered their forces and stopped the advance. As Lithuanian flanks were not defended, they decided to abandon the offensive. Soviets also accused Germans of violating the demarcation line set on January 18 and pressured them to retreat.[49]

Poland started an offensive against the Soviets in March 1919. They pushed east and north, entering Vilnius Region, the territory claimed by Lithuanians. Between April 19 and 21, Poles captured Vilnius during the Vilna offensive and by May secured their positions.[58] The Polish army forced the Soviets to withdraw their left wing from the territories south of the Neris River. This Polish advance significantly shortened the Lithuanian–Soviet front line and allowed Lithuania to concentrate its forces for operations in northeastern Lithuania.[59] However, it also meant that a new front line with Poland was open. At first, both Poles and Lithuanians cooperated against the Soviets, but soon the cooperation gave way to increasing hostility.[60] The first clashes between Polish and Lithuanian soldiers occurred on April 26 and May 8 near Vievis.[61]

Poland did not recognize Lithuania as its Chief of State Józef Piłsudski wanted a union with Lithuania in hopes of reviving the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see Międzymorze federation).[26] Poland justified its actions not only as part of a military campaign against the Soviets but also as the right of self-determination of local Poles, who formed a significant minority in eastern Lithuania.[62] Lithuanians claimed Vilnius as their historical capital and opposed to any federation with Poland, desiring an independent national Lithuanian state.[58] The Lithuanian government in Kaunas saw the Polish presence in Vilnius as an occupation. In addition to the Vilnius Region, the nearby Suwałki Region was also disputed. The Polish–Lithuanian relations were not immediately hostile but grew worse as each side refused to compromise.[60]

Polish advances against the Soviets necessitated changes in Lithuanian strategy. On April 26, General Silvestras Žukauskas, who just recovered from typhus, was designated Chief of the General Staff.[19] He decided to mount an offensive in northeastern Lithuania. The first objective was to take over Ukmergė. On May 3, the Separate Panevėžys Volunteer Regiment, supported by the 18th Regiment of Saxon Volunteers, had secured the town. The operation was risky as for a while Kėdainiai was unprotected opening a path to Kaunas,[32] but also very successful: some 500 Soviet soldiers were taken prisoner and about 50 Poles, captured by the Soviets in the battles near Vilnius, were liberated and returned to Poland.[63] On May 7, Lithuanians entered Širvintos, where they found Polish troops. Lithuanians and Poles mounted a joint operation to take Giedraičiai on May 9.[32]

The Lithuanian army's chain of command was reformed. On May 7, General Žukauskas assumed command of the entire Lithuanian army and initiated a complete reorganization of the Lithuanian forces into two groups.[64] The first brigade, stationed in Ukmergė, was called the Vilkmergė Group and included a battalion of Saxon Volunteers. Its first commander Kazys Ladiga was ordered to push along the Utena–Zarasai line.[32] The second brigade, called the Panevėžys Group, was charged with capturing Panevėžys and then pushing along the Kupiškis–Rokiškis–Obeliai line.[32] The group, initially commanded by Jonas Variakojis, was aided by Joniškėlis' partisans from the north. The Ministry of Defense and the General Staff were also reorganized.[64]

On May 18, the reorganized army carried out its first operation. The Vilkmergė Group captured Kurkliai and Anykščiai.[65] On May 22, the Group launched an attack on Utena. The initiative was met by a Soviet counterattack and the Lithuanian forces retreated. Further attacks were stopped for several days to wait for the results of the advance on Kupiškis.[66] The drive towards Utena resumed on May 31, and the city was secured on June 2. The Panevėžys Group launched a drive towards Panevėžys on May 18 and secured the city the following day, but lost it to a Bolshevik counterattack, carried out on May 21.[32] However, the Soviets left Panevėžys without a fight two days later.[67] The Group charged towards Kupiškis and secured Subačius. On May 30, Joniškėlis' partisans broke through the Soviet lines and liberated Rokiškis in Soviet rear;[68] Bolshevik forces, afraid that they could be encircled, left Kupiškis on the night of May 30–31, and Lithuania secured that city on June 1.[69]

After Utena's liberation, Saxon Volunteers left the front and by mid-July departed Lithuania.[32] However, Lithuanian advance continued and, on June 10, Lithuanian forces reached the territory controlled by Latvian partisans (Green Guard) and supplied them with munitions.[70] On June 12, the Soviets counterattacked and Lithuanians were stopped. Another Soviet push came on June 20 and the front stabilized.[71] The Soviets were cornered in a small region around Zarasai. Between July 6 and 12, Lithuanians with some Latvian assistance attempted to drive out the Bolsheviks. The Soviets gathered their forces from calmer fronts and forced Lithuanians to retreat to their former positions.[68]

While Lithuanian forces battled the Soviets in northeastern Lithuania, the tension between Poland and Lithuania grew. Direct negotiations between May 28 and June 11, 1919, collapsed as neither side was inclined to compromise.[72] Trying to prevent a direct military conflict, the Allied Supreme Council drew the first demarcation line on June 18, 1919.[62] The line was drawn several kilometres west of the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway. Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected it as it required the Polish forces to retreat up to 30–35 km (19–22 mi); Lithuanians were discontent as well, as it left Vilnius and Gardinas under Polish control.[73] As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania (their last units left Kaunas in mid-July), Poland mounted an offensive on 100 km (62 mi) wide front moving 20–30 km (12–19 mi) deeper into the Lithuanian territory.[74] Preoccupied with the Soviet threat, Lithuania could not organize an effective defence and the Entente intervened again by drawing the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line, on July 26, 1919. Two major modifications were made: Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km (4.3 mi) west.[75] Neither Lithuanians, Poles, nor Germans (still present in the Suwałki Region) were content with the new demarcation line.[76] Between July 29 and August 2, Polish troops attacked Lithuanians several times.[77] On August 3, a Polish diplomatic mission in Kaunas declared that Poland has no plans to annex Lithuania and proposed a plebiscite in the contested territories, allowing local inhabitants to determine their future.[78] When the Lithuanian government rejected the Polish proposal, Józef Piłsudski decided that further military action was not a solution. Instead, the Lithuanian government itself needed to be replaced by a party more willing to negotiate a compromise.[78][79] The front stabilized, but bilateral relations worsened in the aftermath of the Sejny Uprising (August 23 – September 9) which in turn ruined the attempted coup d'état by the Polish Military Organisation against the Lithuanian government (August 28–29).[80]

Due to the threat from Poland, the front with the Soviets was quiet for more than a month. There were minor incidents involving scouts or outpost guards.[81] The Red Army used the time to reorganize and strengthen their forces, using natural barriers, like plentiful lakes, rivers, and hills, enhanced with trenches and barbed wires, to secure their position.[82] They also had field fortifications from World War I about 10 km (6.2 mi) south of Daugavpils.[68] The Soviets had larger forces: Lithuanians had two infantry regiments and five separate battalions; the Soviets had six regiments and one separate battalion.[68] Together, the Lithuanians and the Poles planned to advance to Daugavpils starting August 9, but the plans were delayed until August 23.[83]

The Ukmergė Group attacked first and liberated Zarasai on August 25. The Group moved about 30 km (19 mi) into the Soviet-controlled territory, but neither the right nor left flanks were adequately protected by the Polish units or the Panevėžys Group.[84] The Panevėžys Group began advancing on August 26 and Polish troops moved along the railroad towards Turmantas.[85] The Lithuanians manoeuvred around the old Russian fortifications, forcing the Red Army to retreat.[68] Converging on Daugavpils, the Lithuanian–Soviet front shortened and the Lithuanians were able to concentrate their forces.[86] On August 28, the Soviets began retreating north across the Daugava River.[87] By August 31, on the southern shore of the Daugava, the Soviet held only Grīva, a suburb of Daugavpils.[88]

The Bolshevik enemy was driven out from the Lithuanian territory and the narrow front stabilized as Lithuanians and Soviets were separated by the Daugava River. The Lithuanian main forces could be redeployed elsewhere, including protection of the demarcation line with Poland and the planned attacks against the Bermontians in northern Lithuania.[1] In September 1919, joint Polish and Latvian forces took Daugava's southern shore, including Grīva. The Lithuanian–Soviet front remained open until the Battle of Daugavpils when Latvian and Polish forces captured Daugavpils in January 1920. The Lithuanians did not participate in these operations.[89] The Lithuanians claimed the territory, taken by their soldiers, for themselves despite Latvian protests.[90] This led to several skirmishes between Latvian and Lithuanian troops, but the border issue was successfully mediated by Britain and finally resolved in March 1921.[90]

The first Lithuanian–Soviet attempt at negotiations took place on 11 September 1919, after the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs of Soviet Russia, Georgy Chicherin, sent a note with a proposal for a peace treaty.[91] However, Lithuania delayed the talks as it feared that negotiations with communist Russia, which was isolated from European politics, would damage its relationships with the Allied Powers that had not yet recognized Lithuania.[91] The talks began only in May 1920 and were highly influenced by the events in the Polish–Soviet War. The Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was concluded on July 12. Russia recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region; in exchange, Lithuania granted Soviet forces unrestricted movement during the war against Poland.[80] This compromised Lithuania's declared neutrality and further deepened the Polish–Lithuanian crisis.[92]

On 14 July 1920, the Soviets occupied Vilnius but did not transfer the city to the Lithuanian administration as agreed in the peace treaty. Instead, the Soviets planned a coup to overthrow the Lithuanian government and establish a Soviet republic.[92] However, the Soviets lost the Battle of Warsaw and were pushed back by the Poles. Some historians credit this victory for saving Lithuania's independence from the Soviet coup.[80][93] On August 26, the Red Army left Vilnius and Lithuanians prepared to defend their borders. As Poland did not recognize the treaty, this led to further hostilities. Eventually, Lithuania lost the Vilnius Region to Poland during the Żeligowski's Mutiny. When mediation by the League of Nations failed to change the situation, Lithuania and Poland were suspended in the state of ""no war, no peace"" until the Polish ultimatum of 1938.[94] During all this time, Soviet Russia became Lithuania's strongest ally against Poland.[95]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian–Soviet_War

Jagiellonian dynasty,"The Jagiellonian (US: /ˌjɑːɡjəˈloʊniən/ YAH-gyə-LOH-nee-ən) or Jagellonian dynasty (US: /ˌjɑːɡəˈ-/ YAH-gə-; Lithuanian: Jogailaičių dinastija; Polish: dynastia jagiellońska), otherwise the Jagiellon dynasty (Polish: dynastia Jagiellonów), the House of Jagiellon (Polish: Dom Jagiellonów), or simply the Jagiellons (Lithuanian: Jogailaičiai; Polish: Jagiellonowie; Latin: Iagellonidae), was the name assumed by a cadet branch of the Lithuanian ducal dynasty of Gediminids upon reception by Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, of baptism as Ladislaus in 1386, which paved the way to his ensuing marriage to the Queen Regnant[a] Hedwig of Poland, resulting in his ascension to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland as Ladislaus II Jagiełło (initially ruling jure uxoris jointly with Jadwiga until her death), and the effective promotion of his branch to a royal dynasty.[1][2] The Jagiellons were polyglots and per historical evidence Casimir IV Jagiellon and his son Saint Casimir possibly were the last Jagiellons who spoke in their patrilineal ancestors' Lithuanian language;[3][4][5] however, even the last patrilineal Jagiellonian monarch Sigismund II Augustus maintained two separate and equally lavish Lithuanian-speaking and Polish-speaking royal courts in Lithuania's capital Vilnius.[6] The Jagiellons reigned in several European countries between the 14th and 16th centuries. Members of the dynasty were Kings of Poland (1386–1572), Grand Dukes of Lithuania (1377–1392 and 1440–1572), Kings of Hungary (1440–1444 and 1490–1526), and Kings of Bohemia and imperial electors (1471–1526).[1]

The personal union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (converted in 1569 with the Treaty of Lublin into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) is the reason for the common appellation ""Poland–Lithuania"" in discussions about the area from the Late Middle Ages onward. One Jagiellon, Ladislaus III of Poland, briefly ruled both Poland and Hungary (1440–1444), and two others ruled both Bohemia and Hungary (1490–1526) and then continued in the distaff line as a branch of the House of Habsburg.

The Polish ""Golden Age"", the period of the reigns of Sigismund I and Sigismund II, the last two Jagiellonian kings, or more generally the 16th century, is most often identified with the rise of the culture of Polish Renaissance. The cultural blossoming had its material base in the prosperity of the elites, both the landed nobility and urban patriciate at such centers as Kraków and Gdańsk.

The name comes from Jogaila (Jagiełło), the first Grand Duke of Lithuania to become King of Poland. In Polish, the dynasty is known as Jagiellonowie and the patronymic form: Jagiellończyk; in Lithuanian it is called Jogailaičiai, in Belarusian Яґайлавічы (Jagajłavičy), in Hungarian Jagelló, and in Czech Jagellonci, as well as Jagello or Jagellon in Latin. Etymologically, the name Jogaila means ""strong rider"", from the Lithuanian words joti (to ride) and gailus (strong, powerful).[citation needed]

The rule of Piasts, the earlier Polish ruling house (c. 962–1370) had ended with the death of King Casimir III the Great. Gediminids, the immediate predecessors of the first Jagiellonian, were rulers of medieval Lithuania with the title of Grand Duke. Their realm, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was chiefly inhabited by Lithuanians and Ruthenians.

Jogaila, the eponymous first ruler of the Jagiellonian dynasty, started as the Grand Duke of Lithuania. As a result of the Union of Krewo he then converted to Christianity and married the 11-year-old Queen Hedwig of Poland (daughter of King Louis I of Hungary from the Angevins Dynasty). Thereby he became jure uxoris King of Poland as her co-ruler and founded the dynasty. Angevin rulers were the second and Jagiellonian third dynasty of Polish Kings.[citation needed]

In 1385 the Union of Krewo was signed between Queen Hedwig of Poland and Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, the last pagan state in Europe. The act arranged for Jogaila's baptism (after which Jogaila was known in Poland by his baptismal name, Ladislaus, and the Polish version of his Lithuanian name, Jagiełło) (Zamoyski, the Polish Way) and for the couple's marriage and constituted the beginning of the Polish–Lithuanian union. The Union strengthened both nations in their shared opposition to the Teutonic Knights and the growing threat of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Uniquely in Europe, the union connected two states geographically located on the opposite sides of the great civilizational divide between the Western or Latin, and the Eastern or Byzantine worlds.[7]

The intention of the Union was to create a common state under Ladislaus II Jagiełło, but the Polish ruling oligarchy's idea of incorporation of Lithuania into Poland turned out to be unrealistic. There would be territorial disputes and warfare between Poland and Lithuania or Lithuanian factions; the Lithuanians at times had even found it expedient to conspire with the Teutonic Knights against the Poles. Geographic consequences of the dynastic union and the preferences of the Jagiellonian kings accelerated the process of reorientation of Polish territorial priorities to the east.[8] The political influence of the Jagiellonian kings was diminishing during this period, which was accompanied by the ever-increasing role in central government and national affairs of landed nobility.[b] The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage, the Golden Age of Polish culture.

The Great War of 1409–1411, precipitated by the Lithuanian uprising in the Order controlled Samogitia, included the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg), where the Polish and Lithuanian-Rus' armies completely defeated the Teutonic Knights. The offensive that followed lost its impact with the ineffective siege of Malbork (Marienburg). The failure to take the fortress and eliminate the Teutonic (later Prussian) state had for Poland dire historic consequences in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The Peace of Thorn (1411) had given Poland and Lithuania rather modest territorial adjustments, including Samogitia. Afterwards there were negotiations and peace deals that didn't hold, more military campaigns and arbitrations. One attempted, unresolved arbitration took place at the Council of Constance.

During the Hussite Wars (1420–1434), Jagiełło, Vytautas and Sigismund Korybut were involved in political and military maneuvering concerning the Czech crown, offered by the Hussites first to Jagiełło in 1420. Zbigniew Oleśnicki became known as the leading opponent of a union with the Hussite Czech state.[10]

The Jagiellonian dynasty was not entitled to automatic hereditary succession, as each new king had to be approved by nobility consensus. Władysław Jagiełło had two sons late in life from his last wife, Sophia of Halshany. In 1430 the nobility agreed to the succession of the future Ladislaus III, only after the King gave in and guaranteed the satisfaction of their new demands. In 1434 the old monarch died and his minor son Ladislaus was crowned; the Royal Council led by Bishop Oleśnicki undertook the regency duties. In 1438 the Czech anti-Habsburg opposition, mainly Hussite factions, offered the Czech crown to Jagiełło's younger son Casimir IV. The idea, accepted in Poland over Oleśnicki's objections, resulted in two unsuccessful Polish military expeditions to Bohemia.[10]

After Vytautas' death in 1430 Lithuania became embroiled in internal wars and conflicts with Poland. Casimir IV, sent as a boy by Ladislaus III on a mission there in 1440, was surprisingly proclaimed by the Lithuanians as a Grand Duke of Lithuania, and he stayed in Lithuania.[10]

Oleśnicki gained the upper hand again and pursued his long-term objective of Poland's union with Hungary. At that time the Ottoman Empire embarked on a new round of European conquests and threatened Hungary, which needed the powerful Polish–Lithuanian ally. In 1440 Ladislaus III assumed the Hungarian throne. Influenced by Julian Cesarini, the young king led the Hungarian army against the Ottomans in 1443 and again in 1444. Like Cesarini, Ladislaus III was killed at the Battle of Varna. Beginning toward the end of Jagiełło's life, Poland was practically governed by a magnate oligarchy led by Oleśnicki. The rule of the dignitaries was actively opposed by various szlachta groups. Their leader Spytek of Melsztyn was killed during an armed confrontation in 1439, which allowed Oleśnicki to purge Poland of the remaining Hussite sympathizers and pursue his other objectives without significant opposition.

Casimir IV Jagiellon was the third and youngest son of King Ladislaus II Jagiełło and his fourth wife, Sophia of Halshany. His father was already 65 at the time of Casimir's birth, and his brother Ladislaus III, three years his senior, was expected to become king before his majority. Strangely, little was done for his education; he was never taught Latin, nor was he trained for the responsibilities of office, despite the fact he was the only brother of the rightful sovereign.[11] He often relied on his instinct and feelings and had little political knowledge, but shared a great interest in the diplomacy and economic affairs of the country. Throughout Casimir's youth, Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki was his mentor and tutor; however, the cleric felt a strong reluctance towards him, believing that he would be an unsuccessful monarch following Ladislaus' death.

The sudden death of Sigismund Kęstutaitis left the office of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania empty. The Voivode of Trakai, Jonas Goštautas, and other magnates of Lithuania, supported Casimir IV Jagiellon as a candidate to the throne.[12] However, many Polish noblemen hoped that the thirteen-year-old boy would become a Vice-regent for the Polish King in Lithuania. Casimir IV Jagiellon was invited by the Lithuanian magnates to Lithuania and was sent by his older brother Ladislaus III, King of Poland and Hungary, Supreme Duke of Lithuania, to Lithuania to rule in his name.[13] But instead he was elected by the Lithuanian Council of Lords as the Grand Duke of Lithuania upon his arrival to Lithuania's capital Vilnius on June 29, 1440, with the ringing of church bells and the singing of the Te Deum laudamus.[13][14] The Bishop of Vilnius put a Gediminas' Cap in the Vilnius Cathedral on Casimir IV Jagiellon's head, despite the Polish nobility's opposition.[15][16] This was breaching the agreements of the Union of Grodno (1432) and terminating the Polish–Lithuanian union.[15][16] It manifested Lithuania as a sovereign state and its ruler Casimir IV Jagiellon stressed himself as a ""free lord"" (pan – dominus).[16] When the news arrived in Poland concerning the proclamation of Casimir IV Jagiellon as the Grand Duke of Lithuania, it was met with hostility, even to the point of military threats against Lithuania.[17] Since the young Lithuanian Grand Duke was underage, the supreme control over the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was in the hands of the Lithuanian Council of Lords, presided by Jonas Goštautas, while Casimir IV Jagiellon was taught Lithuanian language and the customs of Lithuania by appointed court officials.[3][18][19][20]

In 1445, Casimir IV Jagiellon, already being the Grand Duke of Lithuania, was asked to also assume the Polish throne vacated by the death of his brother Ladislaus III (killed at the Battle of Varna in 1444). Casimir IV Jagiellon was a tough negotiator and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election, thus he assumed the Polish throne only on a condition that Lithuania and Poland will be equivalent states.[21] Casimir IV Jagiellon succeeded his brother Ladislaus III as King of Poland after a three-year interregnum on 25 June 1447. In 1454, Casimir IV Jagiellon married Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of the late King of the Romans Albert II of Habsburg by his late wife Elisabeth of Bohemia. Her distant relative Frederick of Austria became Holy Roman Emperor and reigned as Frederick III until after Casimir IV Jagiellon's own death. The marriage strengthened the ties between the house of Jagiellon and the sovereigns of Hungary-Bohemia and put Casimir IV Jagiellon at odds with the Holy Roman Emperor through internal Habsburg rivalry. Becoming a King of Poland Casimir IV Jagiellon also freed himself from the control the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447 he declared the Lithuanian nobility having equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time Casimir IV Jagiellon was able to remove from power Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group,[22] basing his own power on the younger middle nobility camp instead. A conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions Casimir IV Jagiellon also resolved in his favor.

That same year, Casimir IV Jagiellon was approached by the Prussian Confederation for aid against the Teutonic Order, which he promised, by making the separatist Prussian regions a protectorate of the Polish Kingdom. However, when the insurgent cities rebelled against the Order, it resisted and the Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466) ensued. Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Prussian Confederation defeated the Teutonic Order, taking over its capital at Marienburg (Malbork Castle). In the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Order recognized Polish sovereignty over the seceded western Prussian regions, Royal Prussia, and the Polish crown's overlordship over the remaining Teutonic Monastic State, transformed in 1525 into a duchy, Ducal Prussia. Poland regained Pomerelia and with it the all-important access to the Baltic Sea, as well as Warmia. In addition to land warfare, naval battles had taken place, where ships provided by the City of Danzig (Gdańsk) successfully fought Danish and Teutonic fleets.[23]

Other 15th-century Polish territorial gains, or rather revindications, included the Duchy of Oświęcim and Duchy of Zator on Silesia's border with Lesser Poland, and there was notable progress regarding the incorporation of the Piast Masovian duchies into the Crown.

The influence of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Central Europe had been on the rise. In 1471 Casimir's son Ladislaus became a king of Bohemia, and in 1490 also of Hungary. The southern and eastern outskirts of Poland and Lithuania became threatened by Turkish invasions beginning in the late 15th century. Moldavia's involvement with Poland goes back to 1387, when Peter I, Hospodar of Moldavia, seeking protection against the Hungarians, paid Jagiełło homage in Lviv, which gave Poland access to the Black Sea ports. In 1485 King Casimir undertook an expedition into Moldavia, after its seaports were overtaken by the Ottoman Turks. The Turkish controlled Crimean Tatars raided the eastern territories in 1482 and 1487, until they were confronted by King John Albert, Casimir's son and successor. Poland was attacked in 1487–1491 by remnants of the Golden Horde. They had invaded into Poland as far as Lublin before being beaten at Zaslavl. King John Albert in 1497 made an attempt to resolve the Turkish problem militarily, but his efforts were unsuccessful as he was unable to secure effective participation in the war by his brothers, King Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary and Alexander, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and because of the resistance on the part of Stephen the Great, the ruler of Moldavia. More Ottoman Empire-instigated destructive Tatar raids took place in 1498, 1499 and 1500. John Albert's diplomatic peace efforts that followed were finalized after the king's death in 1503, resulting in a territorial compromise and an unstable truce.

The Grand Duke Alexander was elected King of Poland in 1501, after the death of John Albert.[24] In 1506 he was succeeded by Sigismund I the Old (Polish: Zygmunt I Stary, Lithuanian: Žygimantas Senasis) in both Poland and Lithuania, as the political realities were drawing the two states closer together.[25] Prior to that Sigismund I had been a Duke of Silesia by the authority of his brother Ladislaus II of Bohemia, but like other Jagiellon rulers before him, he had not pursued the Polish Crown's claim to Silesia.

After the death of King Alexander I, Sigismund I arrived in Vilnius, where he was elected by the Lithuanian Ducal Council on 13 September 1506 as Grand Duke of Lithuania, contrary to the Union of Mielnik, which involved a joint Polish-Lithuanian election of a monarch.[25] On 8 December 1506 during the session of the Polish Senate in Piotrków, Sigismund I was elected King of Poland.[25] He arrived in Kraków on 20 January 1507 and was crowned four days later in Wawel Cathedral by Primate Andrzej Boryszewski. In 1518 Sigismund I married Bona Sforza d'Aragona, a young, strong-minded Italian princess.[25] Bona's sway over the king and the magnates, her efforts to strengthen the monarch's political position, financial situation, and especially the measures she took to advance her personal and dynastic interests, including the forced royal election of the minor Sigismund Augustus in 1529 and his premature coronation in 1530, increased the discontent among szlachta activists.[26]

The rebellion of Lwów (the so-called Chicken War) was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist rokosz (rebellion) by the Polish nobility that occurred in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the ""war's"" only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lwów, in Lesser Poland. The nobility, gathered near the city to meet with a levée en masse, called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility called a rebellion, or semi-legal rebellion, to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably: a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the tithes, a clean-up of the Treasury rather than its expansion, confirmation and extension of the privileges of the nobility, lifting of the toll or exemption of the nobility from it, adoption of a law concerning incompatibilitas—the incompatibility of certain offices that were not to be joined in the same hand, the carrying out of a law requiring the appointment of only the local nobles to most important local offices and the creation of a body of permanent advisors to the king.[citation needed] Finally, the protesters criticised the role of Queen Bona, whom they blamed for the ""bad education"" of young Prince Sigismund Augustus (the future King Sigismund II Augustus), as well as for seeking to increase her power and influence in the state.

Following an agreement between Sigismund I, Bona Sforza and Lithuanian Council of Lords, Sigismund II Augustus was proclaimed as Grand Duke of Lithuania when he was 9 years old in Vilnius in 1529.[27][28] Initially, Sigismund II opposed the Polish–Lithuanian union as he sought to leave the Lithuanian throne to his heirs as Jagiellonian patrimony.[27][28] In 1544 Sigismund II began to independently rule the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[28] In 1547 Sigismund II moved his royal court from Kraków to Vilnius and it had a great influence on the intellectual life of the region.[29][30] In 1548 Sigismund II finished the Renaissance style reconstruction of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius which was started by his father, Sigismund I.[27][31] Sigismund II maintained two separate and equally lavish Lithuanian-speaking and Polish-speaking royal courts in Vilnius.[6]

From the outset of his reign, Sigismund II came into collision with the country's nobility, who had already begun curtailing the power of the great families. The ostensible cause of the nobility's animosity to the King was his second marriage, secretly contracted before his accession to the throne, with (said to be beautiful) Lithuanian Calvinist, Barbara Radziwiłł, daughter of Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł.[32] The secret marriage was strongly opposed by his mother Bona and by the magnates of the Crown.[32] Sigismund II, who took over the reign of the Kingdom of Poland after his father's Sigismund I death in 1548, overcame the resistance and had Barbara crowned in 1550; a few months later the new queen died.[32][27] Sigismund II accompanied the funeral procession of Barbara from Kraków to Vilnius by personally going on foot through cities.[33] Bona, estranged from her son returned to Italy in 1556, where she died soon afterwards.[26]

Sigismund II possessed to a high degree the tenacity and patience that seem to have characterized all the Jagiellons, and he added to these qualities a dexterity and diplomatic finesse. No other Polish king seems to have so thoroughly understood the nature of the Polish sejm. Both the Austrian ambassadors and the papal legates testify to the care with which he controlled his nation. Everything went as he wished, they said, because he seemed to know everything in advance. He managed to get more money out of the sejm than his father ever could, and at one of his sejms he won the hearts of the assembly by unexpectedly appearing before them in the simple grey coat of a Masovian lord. Like his father, a pro-Austrian by conviction, he contrived even in this respect to carry with him the nation, often distrustful of the Germans. He avoided serious complications with the powerful Turks.

Sigismund II mediated for twenty years between the Catholic Church and the Protestants. Unsuccessful and debilitating beginning of the Livonian War for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Lithuanian nobility's desire for equal rights with the Polish nobility resulted in childless Sigismund II's possibly the most striking memorial—the Union of Lublin, which united Poland and Lithuania with equal rights into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth—the ""Republic of the Two Nations"" (Polish: Rzeczpospolita Obojga Narodów, Lithuanian: Abiejų Tautų Respublika).[27][34][35] Also, German-speaking Royal Prussia and Prussian cities were included. This achievement might well have been impossible without Sigismund II.

Bona Sforza was pregnant and expected to give birth to a legitimate brother of Sigismund II Augustus; however, in 1527, being pregnant for five-months, she fall from a horse during hunting of a bear and gave a preterm birth to her second son who was born alive and baptized as Albert, but died a few hours after his birth and was buried in the Niepołomice Castle's chapel.[36][37]

The Polish ""Golden Age"", the period of the reigns of Sigismund I and Sigismund II, the last two Jagiellonian kings, or more generally the 16th century, is most often identified with the rise of the culture of Polish Renaissance. The cultural flowering had its material base in the prosperity of the elites, both the landed nobility and urban patriciate at such centers as Kraków and Gdańsk. As was the case with other European nations, the Renaissance inspiration came in the first place from Italy, a process accelerated to some degree by the marriage of Sigismund I to Bona Sforza. Many Poles traveled to Italy to study and to learn its culture. As imitating Italian ways became very trendy (the royal courts of the two kings provided the leadership and example for everybody else), many Italian artists and thinkers were coming to Poland, some settling and working there for many years. While the pioneering Polish humanists, greatly influenced by Erasmus of Rotterdam, accomplished the preliminary assimilation of the antiquity culture, the generation that followed was able to put greater emphasis on the development of native elements, and because of its social diversity, advanced the process of national integration. The Academy of Kraków and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools and the households of townspeople. Illiteracy levels were falling, as by the end of the 16th century almost every parish ran a school.

In 1515, during a congress in Vienna, a dynastic succession arrangement was agreed to between Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and the Jagiellon brothers, Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary and Sigismund I of Poland and Lithuania. It was supposed to end the Emperor's support for Poland's enemies, the Teutonic and Russian states, but after the election of Charles V, Maximilian's successor in 1519, the relations with Sigismund had worsened.[38]

The Jagiellon rivalry with the House of Habsburg in central Europe was ultimately resolved to the Habsburgs' advantage. The decisive factor that damaged or weakened the monarchies of the last Jagiellons was the Ottoman Empire's Turkish expansion. Hungary's vulnerability greatly increased after Suleiman the Magnificent took the Belgrade fortress in 1521. To prevent Poland from extending military aid to Hungary, Suleiman had a Tatar-Turkish force raid southeastern Poland–Lithuania in 1524. The Hungarian army was defeated in 1526 at the Battle of Mohács, where the young Louis II Jagiellon, son of Vladislaus II, was killed. Subsequently, after a period of internal strife and external intervention, Hungary was partitioned between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans.

Vladislaus was born on 1 March 1456, the oldest son of King Casimir IV of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, then the head of the ruling Jagiellon dynasty of Poland, and Elizabeth of Austria, daughter of Albert, King of Germany, Hungary and Bohemia. He was christened as the namesake of his grandfather, King Ladislaus Jagiełło of Poland and Lithuania, his maternal uncle King Ladislaus the Posthumous of Bohemia and his paternal uncle Ladislaus III of Poland, an earlier king of Hungary.

He was proposed for the Bohemian throne by the widow of the previous king, George of Poděbrady, and was crowned King of Bohemia on 22 August 1471. The period after the death of George of Poděbrady was a time of conflict for the Bohemian throne (see Bohemian–Hungarian War (1468–1478)), and Vladislaus was unable to confront it. At the time of his arrival in Prague, he was only fifteen years old and significantly dominated by his advisers. The succession conflict was settled in 1479 in the Peace of Olomouc, which allowed both Vladislaus and Matthias Corvinus to use the title ""King of Bohemia"". Vladislaus would reign in Bohemia proper, while Matthias gained Moravia, Silesia, and the two Lusatias. The deal also stipulated that in case of Matthias' death, Vladislaus would pay 400,000 gulden for the entirety of the Bohemian lands. However, this payment was not made once Vladislaus became King of Hungary after the death of Matthias.

Great chaos overcame Hungary when the King Matthias Corvinus died without heir in 1490. His illegitimate son John Corvinus was not recognized by the Hungarian nobility, and after being forced to retreat, they called Vladislaus to Hungary, as his mother was the sister of the long ago deceased King Ladislaus and granddaughter of King Sigismund. Vladislaus was then crowned King of Hungary on 18 September 1490.

Vladislaus immediately moved to Hungary, and there he lived the rest of his life, having his court and all his children born in the palace of Buda. The Hungarian nobility reigned and took many important decisions in his name, and his role as monarch soon passed to be in a second plan. Stephen Zápolya, the archbishop Tamás Bakócz and George Szatmári continued with the Turkish war plans and tried then to maintain the Kingdom that fell in a severe economical crisis after Matthias's death. Vladislaus was a cheerful man, but after the death of his third wife, he fell into a severe depression and almost retired from all official issues. Then he gained the nickname of ""Vladislaus Bene"" (Polish: Władysław Dobrze, Hungarian: Dobzse László, Czech: král Dobře) because to almost any request he answered, ""Bene"" (Latin for ""(It is) well"").

Louis II was the son of Ladislaus II Jagiellon and his third wife, Anne of Foix-Candale. In 1515 Louis II was married to Mary of Austria, granddaughter of Emperor Maximilian I, as stipulated by the First Congress of Vienna in 1515. His sister Anne was married to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, then a governor on behalf of his brother Charles V, and later Emperor Ferdinand I.

Following the accession to the throne of Suleiman I, the sultan sent an ambassador to Louis II to collect the annual tribute that Hungary had been subjected to. Louis refused to pay annual tribute and had the Ottoman ambassador executed and sent the head to the Sultan. Louis believed that the Papal States and other Christian States including Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor would help him. This event hastened the fall of Hungary. The Ottoman Empire declared war on the Kingdom of Hungary, Suleiman postponed his plan to besiege Rhodes and made an expedition to Belgrade. Louis failed to coordinate and gather his forces. At the same time, Hungary was unable to get assistance from other European states, which Louis had hoped for. Belgrade and many strategic castles in Serbia were captured by the Ottomans. This was disastrous for Louis' kingdom; without the strategically important cities of Belgrade and Šabac, Hungary, including Buda, was open to further Turkish conquests.

After the siege of Rhodes, in 1526 Suleiman made a second expedition to subdue all of Hungary. Louis made a tactical error when he tried to stop the Ottoman army in an open field battle with a medieval army, insufficient firearms, and obsolete tactics. On 29 August 1526, Louis led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in the disastrous Battle of Mohács. In a pincer movement, the Hungarian army was surrounded by Ottoman cavalry, and in the center, the Hungarian heavy knights and infantry were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties, especially from the well-positioned Ottoman cannons and well-armed and trained Janissary musketeers.

Nearly the entire Hungarian Royal army was destroyed on the battlefield. During the retreat, the twenty-year-old king died in a marsh. As Louis had no legitimate children, Ferdinand was elected as his successor in the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary, but the Hungarian throne was contested by John Zápolya, who ruled the areas of the kingdom conquered by the Turks as an Ottoman client.

Although Louis II's marriage remained childless, he probably had an illegitimate child with his mother's former lady-in-waiting, Angelitha Wass, before his marriage. This son was called John (János in Hungarian). This name appears in sources in Vienna as either János Wass or János Lanthos. The former surname is his mother's maiden name. The latter surname may refer to his occupation. ""Lanthos"" means ""lutenist"", or ""bard"". He received incomes from the Royal Treasury regularly. He had further offspring.

The Jagiellonians were the primary inheritors of the title of the Grand Duke of Lithuania following the deaths of Vytautas the Great, Sigismund Kęstutaitis (children of Grand Duke Kęstutis) as they remained as the most powerful branch of the Lithuanian Gediminids dynasty and were direct ancestors of Grand Duke Gediminas by the man's line.[48]

After Sigismund II Augustus, the dynasty underwent further changes. Sigismund II's heirs were his sisters Anna Jagiellon and Catherine Jagiellon. The latter had married Duke John (a son of King Gustav I), who thereby from 1569 became King John III of Sweden, and they had a son, Sigismund III Vasa; as a result, the Polish branch of the Jagiellonians merged with the House of Vasa, which ruled Poland from 1587 until 1668. During the interval, among others, Stephen Báthory, the husband of the childless Anna, reigned.

At one point, the Jagiellonians established dynastic control also over the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary (from 1490 onwards), with Vladislaus Jagiello whom several history books call Vladisla(u)s II. After being elected and crowned King of Hungary, Vladislaus moved his court to Hungary from where he ruled both countries and his children were born and raised. By Louis' sudden death in Battle of Mohács in 1526, that royal line was extinguished in male line.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_dynasty
First Seimas,"First Seimas of Lithuania was the first parliament (Seimas) democratically elected in Lithuania after it declared independence on February 16, 1918.

The elections took place on October 10–11, 1922, to replace the Constituent Assembly, which adopted the final constitution on August 1, 1922. The Seimas elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the President of Lithuania and Ernestas Galvanauskas, as the new Prime Minister, was entrusted to form a new cabinet of ministers. However, no coalition could muster a majority and the Seimas was in a deadlock: Galvanauskas formed two cabinets, and both got 38 votes for and against. As the Seimas could not continue in such manner, it was dissolved on March 12, 1923. New elections were held in May.

The Seimas was faced with two major international issues: negotiation over the Vilnius Region and the Klaipėda Region. On November 20, 1922, the Seimas authorized Klaipėda Revolt, which started in January. Klaipėda became autonomous region of Lithuania. On March 15, 1923, in part reacting to the January revolt the Conference of Ambassadors confirmed a new demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania and western powers considered Vilnius dispute settled despite Lithuanian protests.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Seimas
Lithuania–Ukraine relations,"Lithuania–Ukraine relations are foreign relations between Lithuania and Ukraine. Both countries are members of the Lublin Triangle, OSCE, Council of Europe, World Trade Organization and United Nations. Lithuania supports Ukraine's European Union and NATO membership. Lithuania has an embassy in Kyiv and Ukraine has an embassy in Vilnius.

Ever since the rule of Gediminas in the 1300s much of present-day Ukraine was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Lithuania took over the Principality of Kiev. Between 1569 and 1795 Poland and Lithuania formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth which incorporated much of what is now Ukraine.[1] Following the partitions of Commonwealth, the bulk of Lithuania and present-day Ukraine fell to the Russian Empire. Both countries formed part of the USSR (Ukraine since 1922, Lithuania since 1944) until 1991.

A number of agreements were signed in November 2009 including the mutual recognition of university qualifications and cooperation in preserving cultural heritage; furthermore, Lithuania promised assistance to Ukraine in its aspirations to become a member of the European Union.[2][3]

In 2014, the Lithuanian president Dalia Grybauskaitė voiced her support for Ukraine in the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[4] In January 2015, Lithuania requested a United Nations Security Council meeting due to the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine.[5] Later on, Vytautas Landsbergis declared that he believes the Minsk agreement to be ""worse than Munich"".[6]

In 2021, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted the importance of Lithuania's support for Ukraine's European Union and NATO aspirations, while the Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda noted that Lithuania supports Ukraine's progress and welcomes reforms in Ukraine.[7]

Following the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lithuania has strongly condemned the invasion and called for military, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.[8] In the prelude of invasion, on 13 February 2022, Lithuania sent FIM-92 Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems and ammunition to Ukraine.[9] Military aid further continued and, according to the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence, as of 21 November 2022, the total aid to Ukraine amounted to €660 million, of which the military aid was €240 million.[10]

In April 2024, the Lithuanian government considered repatriating Ukrainian men of military age living in Lithuania to Ukraine to be drafted into the Ukrainian army.[11] Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė and Defence Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas voiced support for the repatriation of military-age Ukrainian men to Ukraine.[12]

According to the 2016 census, 17,679 ethnic Ukrainians were living in Lithuania, mostly in Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai, Jonava, and Visaginas.[13] Moreover, Lithuania is a popular destination for the Ukrainian migrants and over 21,800 Ukrainians have work-based residence permits.[14][15] The Ukrainians evaluate Lithuania positively.[16][17]

Over 7,000 ethnic Lithuanians are living in Ukraine and are represented by the Lithuanian community of Ukraine organization there.[18][19] Lithuania consistently supports Ukraine in Russo-Ukrainian War.[20][21][22] Lithuania has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine joining NATO.[23]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania–Ukraine_relations

Livonia,"Livonia,[a] known in earlier records as Livland,[1][b] is a historical region on the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. It is named after the Livonians, who lived on the shores of present-day Latvia.

By the end of the 13th century, the name was extended to most of present-day Estonia and Latvia, which the Livonian Brothers of the Sword had conquered during the Livonian Crusade (1193–1290). Medieval Livonia, or Terra Mariana, reached its greatest extent after the Saint George's Night Uprising (1343–1345), which forced Denmark to sell the Duchy of Estonia (northern Estonia conquered by Denmark in the 13th century) to the State of the Teutonic Order in 1346. Livonia, as understood after the retreat of Denmark in 1346, bordered on the Gulf of Finland in the north, Lake Peipus and Russia to the east, and Lithuania to the south.

As a consequence of the Livonian War (1558–1583), the territory of Livonia was reduced to the southern half of Estonia and the northern half of Latvia.

The indigenous inhabitants of Livonia were various Finnic tribes in the north and Baltic tribes in the south. The descendants of the crusaders formed the nucleus of the new ruling class of Livonia after the Livonian Crusade, and they eventually became known as Baltic Germans.

Beginning in the 12th century, Livonia became a target for economic and political expansion by Danes and Germans, particularly for the Hanseatic League and the Cistercian Order. 
Around 1160, Hanseatic traders from Lübeck established a trading post on the site of the future city of Riga, which Bishop Albrecht von Buxthoeven founded in 1201.[1]

The Livonian Chronicle of Henry from the 1220s gives a firsthand account of the Christianization of Livonia, granted as a fief by the Hohenstaufen (de facto but not known as) the King of Germany, Philip of Swabia (r. 1198–1208), to Bishop Albert of Riga (Albert of Buxhoeveden), nephew of Hartwig II, the Archbishop of Bremen, who sailed (1200) with a convoy of ships filled with armed crusaders to carve out a Catholic territory in the east as part of the Livonian Crusade. Bishop Albert founded the military order of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword (Latin: Fratres militiæ Christi Livoniae, German: Schwertbrüderorden) in 1202; Pope Innocent III sanctioned the establishment in 1204. Albert did so in order to aid the Bishopric of Riga in the conversion of the pagan Curonians, Livonians, Semigallians, and Latgalians living on the shores of the Gulf of Riga. The membership of the order comprised German ""warrior monks"". Alternative names of the order include the Christ Knights, Sword Brethren, and the Militia of Christ of Livonia. From its foundation, the undisciplined Order tended to ignore its supposed vassalage to the bishops. In 1215, Albert ordered the construction of a cathedral in Riga. In 1218, he asked King Valdemar II of Denmark for assistance, but Valdemar instead arranged a deal with the Brotherhood and conquered the north of Estonia for Denmark. The Brotherhood had its headquarters at Fellin (Viljandi) in present-day Estonia, where the walls of the Master's castle still[update] stand. Other strongholds included Wenden (Cēsis), Segewold (Sigulda) and Ascheraden (Aizkraukle). The commanders of Fellin, Goldingen (Kuldīga), Marienburg (Alūksne), Reval (Tallinn), and the bailiff of Weißenstein (Paide) belonged to the five-member entourage of the Order's Master.[citation needed]

Pope Gregory IX asked the Brothers to defend Finland from Novgorodian attacks in his letter of 24 November 1232;[2] however, no known information regarding the knights' possible activities in Finland has survived. (Sweden eventually took over Finland after the Second Swedish Crusade in 1249.) In the Battle of Saule in 1236 the Lithuanians and Semigallians decimated the Order. This disaster led the surviving Brothers to become incorporated into the Order of Teutonic Knights in the following year, and from that point on they became known as the Livonian Order. They continued, however, to function in all respects (rule, clothing and policy) as an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Order, headed by their own Master (himself de jure subject to the Teutonic Order's Grand Master).[citation needed]

The January 1229 death of Albert of Riga caused a diocesan feud in the Archbishopric of Riga, as two rival candidates were elected.[3] Pope Gregory IX, through cardinal Otto of Tonengo, tasked Baldwin of Alna as papal legate to resolve the dispute.[4] After securing the submission of Courland, Baldwin soon found himself in conflict with various factions in Livonia, fleeing to Dünamünde and temporarily leaving Livonia in early 1232.[4] The pope made him bishop of Semigallia and gave him papal legation throughout much of Livonia, and Baldwin returned by 1233.[4] He tried to take the castle of Reval (modern Tallinn) from the Sword Brothers, but in c. August–September 1233 they defeated Baldwin, who excommunicated many Sword Brothers in retaliation.[5]

At that point, Livonia was divided into two camps: Baldwin's Bishopric of Semigallia, the Bishopric of Dorpat and the late Albert of Riga's Buxhöveden family plus several monasteries, most Estonians and Curonians, versus the Livonian Sword Brothers, Nicholas' Bishopric of Riga, and the city of Riga.[6] Previous generations of historians have argued that Baldwin attempted to make the whole Baltic region an ecclesiastical state, but Manfred Hellmann [de] (1993) refuted this idea as ""fanciful speculation"".[6] Similarly, the traditional assertion that Baldwin had extensive plans to conquer and convert eastwards into parts of  Pskov and Novgorod do not stand up under scrutiny, showing that papal correspondence with Baldwin was primarily concerned with ending the internal conflict in Livonia on terms favourable to Rome.[7] Therefore, no Livonian faction was allowed to form an alliance with an external power, be they pagan or Novgorodian, to prevent the internal conflict from spilling over and threaten Livonia's external security.[7]

In 1234, the pope recalled Baldwin, and replaced him with William of Modena.[8] The pope did not give a verdict until April 1236, when the Sword Brothers were tasked to return Reval to the Danish king.[8] The terms of the agreement were not finalised until the Treaty of Stensby (7 June 1238), when the Livonian Sword Brothers, crushed at Saule and now submitted to the Teutonic Order, relinquished their claims to Reval and much of northern Estonia to Denmark, and to share future territorial gains with two-thirds for the Danish king and one third for the Livonian Order.[9]

The Livonian Order was a largely autonomous branch of the Teutonic Knights (or Teutonic Order) and a member of the Livonian Confederation from 1418 to 1561. After being defeated by Lithuanian forces in the 1236 Battle of Saule, the remnants of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword were incorporated into the Teutonic Knights as the Livonian Order in 1237. Between 1237 and 1290, the Livonian Order conquered all of Courland, Livonia, and Semigallia, but their attack on northern Russia was repelled in the Battle of Rakvere (1268). In 1346, after the St. George's Night Uprising the Order purchased the rest of Estonia from King Valdemar IV of Denmark. The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia and the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle describe conditions within the Order's territory. The Teutonic Order fell into decline following its defeat in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and the secularization of its Prussian territories by Albert of Brandenburg in 1525, but the Livonian Order managed to maintain an independent existence.

In 1418, the Archbishop of Riga, Johannes Ambundii, organised the five ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire in Medieval Livonia (Livonian Order, Courland, Ösel–Wiek, Dorpat and Riga) into the Livonian Confederation.[10][11]
A diet or Landtag was formed in 1419. The city of Walk was chosen as the site of the diet.[citation needed]

From the 14th to the 16th centuries, Middle Low German – as spoken in the towns of the Hanseatic League — functioned as the established language of the Livonian lands, but High German subsequently succeeded it as the official language in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.[12]

Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor once again asked for help of Gustav I of Sweden, and the Kingdom of Poland also began direct negotiations with Gustav, but nothing resulted because on 29 September 1560, Gustav I Vasa died. The chances for success of Magnus, (who had become Bishop of Courland and of Ösel-Wiek) in 1560 and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 (and in 1570). In 1560 he had been recognised as their sovereign by the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek and by the Bishopric of Courland, and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of the Bishopric of Dorpat; the Bishopric of Reval with the Harrien-Wierland gentry were on his side; the Livonian Order conditionally recognised his right of ownership of the (future) Duchy of Estonia. Then along with Archbishop Wilhelm von Brandenburg of the Archbishopric of Riga and his Coadjutor Christoph von Mecklenburg, Kettler, the last Master of the Teutonic Order, gave to Magnus the portions of the Kingdom of Livonia which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land.[citation needed]

Once Eric XIV of Sweden became king in September 1560 he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with Muscovy and spoke to the burghers of Reval city. He offered them goods to submit to him as well as threatening them. By 6 June 1561,they submitted to him contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. King Eric's brother and future King Johan married the Polish-Lithuanian princess Catherine Jagiellon in 1562. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles that they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to Finland, Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent.[citation needed]

Shortly after that, Erik XIV quickly lost any allies that he was about to obtain, either in the form of Magnus or of the Archbishop of Riga. Magnus was upset that he had been tricked out of his inheritance of Holstein. After Sweden occupied Reval, Frederick II of Denmark made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. Magnus and his brother Frederick II were in great disagreement, and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on 7 August 1562 to help his brother obtain more land and to stall further Swedish advances. Erik XIV did not like this, and the Northern Seven Years' War (1563–1570) broke out, with Sweden pitted against the Free City of Lübeck, Denmark, and Poland-Lithuania. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568 Erik XIV became insane and his brother Johan took his place as King John III of Sweden.[citation needed]

Johan III, due to his friendship with Poland-Lithuania, began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and to dominate Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King Sigismund II Augustus of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, know that he was ready for peace. On 15 December 1570, the Treaty of Stettin concluded the Northern Seven Years' War.[citation needed]

It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities.[citation needed] Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and towards King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to the Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. Analysis indicates that during the Livonian War a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called ""Peace Party"".[citation needed] Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and to avoid the division of Livonia. Thus Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with Ivan IV, proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.[citation needed]

The Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces – scattered bands of household troops (Hofleute) under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 (Battle of Pärnu and Siege of Reval), in 1570–1571 (Siege of Reval; 30 weeks), and in 1574–1576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of Ösel–Wiek to the Danish Crown, and the loss of territory to Tsardom of Russia). In 1575, after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition, as did the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight, not only for Livonia, but also for everywhere due to an understanding that he made with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1578, Magnus retired to the Commonwealth and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.[citation needed]

During the many years of the Livonian War (1558–1582), the Livonian Order suffered a decisive defeat at the hands of troops of Muscovite Russia in the Battle of Ergeme in 1560 and continued living under great threat. Letters to the Holy Roman Emperor arrived from many European countries, warning that Moscow has its eyes on much more than only a few harbors or the province of Liefland ... the East Sea (Ostsee-Baltic Sea) and the West Sea (Atlantic) are equally in danger. Duke Barnim the Elder, 50 years duke of Pomerania, warned, that never before did he experience the fear than now, where even in his land, where people send by Moscow are everywhere.[citation needed] At stake was the Narva-trade-route and practically all trade in the North, and with that all of Europe. Due to the religious upheavals of the Reformation the distant Holy Roman Empire could not send troops, which it could not afford anyway. The Duchy of Prussia was not able to help for much of the same reason, and Duke Albrecht (r. 1525–1568) was under continuous ban by the Empire. The Hanseatic League was greatly weakened by this[clarification needed] and the city state of Luebeck fought its last great war. The emperor Maximilian II (r. 1564–1576) diffused the greatest threat by remaining on friendly terms with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia (r. 1533–1584), but not sending Ivan IV troops as requested in his struggles with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[citation needed]

In 1570, Tsar Ivan IV of Russia installed Duke Magnus as King of Livonia. The other forces opposed this appointment. The Livonian Order saw no other way than to seek protection from Sigismund II Augustus (King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania), who had intervened in a war between Bishop William of Riga and the Brothers in 1557. After coming to an agreement with Sigismund II Augustus and his representatives (especially Mikołaj ""the Black"" Radziwiłł), the last Livonian Master, Gotthard Kettler, secularized the Order and converted to Lutheranism. In the southern part of the Brothers' lands, he set up the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia for his family. Most of the remaining lands were seized by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Denmark and Sweden re-occupied the north of Estonia.[citation needed]

In 1561, during the Livonian War, Livonia fell to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania[13][14][15] and became a dependent vassal of Lithuania.[15] Eight years later, in 1569, when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Livonia became a joint domain administered directly by the king and grand duke.[13][15][16][17][18][19] 
Having rejected peace proposals from its enemies, Ivan the Terrible found himself in a difficult position by 1579, when Crimean Khanate devastated Muscovian territories and burnt down Moscow (see Russo-Crimean Wars), the drought and epidemics have fatally affected the economy, Oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government, while The Grand Principality of Lithuania had united with The Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569) and acquired an energetic leader, Stefan Batory, supported by Ottoman Empire (1576). Stefan Batory replied with a series of three offensives against Muscovy, trying to cut The Kingdom of Livonia from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579, with 22,000 men, he retook Polotsk; during the second, in 1580, with 29,000-strong army, he took Velikie Luki, and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the Siege of Pskov. Frederick II of Denmark and Norway had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike Sweden and Poland. He came to an agreement with John III in 1580, giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish–Lithuanian control of Ducatus Ultradunensis only in 1582. After Magnus von Lyffland died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in The Duchy of Courland, and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of Œsel, Denmark was out of the Baltic by 1585. As of 1598 Inflanty Voivodeship was divided onto:

Based on a guarantee by Sigismund II Augustus from the 1560s, the German language retained its official status.[12]

The armies of Ivan the Terrible were initially successful, taking Polotsk (1563) and Parnawa (1575) and overrunning much of Grand Duchy of Lithuania up to some 250 km (160 mi) proximity of Vilnius. Eventually, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569 under the Union of Lublin. Eric XIV of Sweden did not like this, and the Northern Seven Years' War between the Free City of Lübeck, Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II of Denmark and Magnus von Lyffland of the Œsel-Wiek did not fare well. But, in 1569, Erik XIV became insane and his brother John III of Sweden took his place. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King Zygmunt II August, know that he was ready for peace. On 15 December 1570, the Treaty of Stettin was concluded.[citation needed]

In the next phase of the conflict, in 1577, Ivan IV took advantage of the Commonwealth's internal strife (called the war against Gdańsk in Polish historiography), and during the reign of Stefan Batory in Poland, invaded Livonia, quickly taking almost the entire territory, with the exception of Riga and Reval. In 1578, Magnus of Livonia recognized the sovereignty of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (not ratified by the Sejm of Poland-Lithuania, nor recognized by Denmark). The Kingdom of Livonia was beaten back by Muscovy on all fronts. In 1578, Magnus of Livonia retired to The Bishopric of Courland, and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.[citation needed]

Sweden was given roughly the same area as the former Duchy of Livonia after the 1626–1629 Polish–Swedish War. The area, usually known as Swedish Livonia, became a very important Swedish dominion, with Riga being the second largest Swedish city and Livonia paying for one third of the Swedish war costs. Sweden lost Swedish Livonia, Duchy of Estonia and Swedish Ingria to the Russian Empire almost 100 years later, by the Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710 and the Treaty of Nystad in 1721.[20]

The Livonian Voivodeship (Lithuanian: Livonijos vaivadija; Polish: Województwo inflanckie) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Duchy of Livonia, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, since it was formed in the 1620s out of the Wenden Voivodeship till the First Partition of Poland in 1772.[citation needed]

The Russian Empire conquered Swedish Livonia during the course of the Great Northern War and acquired the province in the Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. Peter the Great confirmed German as the exclusive official language.[12] Russia then added Polish Livonia in 1772 during the Partitions of Poland.[citation needed]

In 1796, the Riga Governorate was renamed as the Governorate of Livonia (Russian: Лифляндская губе́рния / Liflyandskaya guberniya, Latvian: Vidzemes guberņa, Estonian: Liivimaa kubermang). From 1845 to 1876, the Baltic governorates of Estonia, Livonia, and Courland — an area roughly corresponding to the historical medieval Livonia — were administratively subordinated to a common Governor-General. Amongst the holders of this post were Count Alexander Arkadyevich Suvorov[21] and Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov.

Livonia remained within the Russian Empire until the end of World War I, when it was split between the newly independent states of Latvia and Estonia. The United Baltic Duchy, alternately known as the ""Grand Duchy of Livonia"", proclaimed by the Baltic German nobility on 12 April 1918, was never recognised by any state, and dissolved at the German surrender in November 1918. Livonia had ceased to exist. From 1918 to 1920, both Soviet troops and German Freikorps fought against Latvian and Estonian troops for control over former Livonia, but their attempts were defeated.[citation needed]

The historical land of Livonia has been split between Latvia and Estonia ever since 1918. The Livonian language is spoken by fewer than 100 individuals as a second language, and is understood to be fast approaching extinction. The last native Livonian speaker died in June 2013.

The unofficial anthem of the Livonians, ""Min izāmō"", shares the melody of the Finnish and Estonian national anthems.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livonia
List of governments of Lithuania (1918–1940),"The list gives the composition of the governments of the Republic of Lithuania from 1918 to 1940. During that period Lithuania was an independent republic. From 1918 to December 1926 it was a democracy and the governments were formed from members of various parties. After the coup of 1926, Lithuania was ruled by authoritarian Antanas Smetona and his party, the Lithuanian National Union. Only the last two governments included members from the opposition.

Sources sometimes give conflicting data about the ministers, especially from the early governments. That is because those governments were short-lived, formed during the time of war, and not well documented.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_of_Lithuania_(1918–1940)
1990 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet election,"Supreme Soviet elections were held in the Lithuanian SSR on 24 February with run-off elections on 4, 7, 8 and 10 March 1990 to elect the 141 members of the Supreme Soviet.[1] In six constituencies, voter turnout was below the required minimum and a third round was held on 17 and 21 April.[2] For the first time since 1940 elections to the People's Seimas, non-communist candidates were allowed to run. The elections were the first free nationwide elections since 1926, and only the fifth free elections in all of Lithuanian history.

The pro-independence Sąjūdis movement refused to become a political party and endorsed non-partisan candidates or candidates of various other political parties based on their personal merits.[3] These endorsements often meant more than the official party affiliations, and Sąjūdis-backed candidates won 91 seats, an outright majority.[1] During its third session on 11 March 1990, the Supreme Soviet adopted the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, declaring Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union.

The Eleventh Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR was elected on 24 February 1985. It acted as rubber stamp legislature up until the summer of 1988. By the summer of that same year Reform Movement was founded and gained support Lithuanian SSR-wide. Along side this, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev announced the slogan of Demokratizatsiya, which intended to make Soviet institutions more democratic. It proposed candidacy of more than one person to single seat in soviets of various levels in the elections.

On 15 January 1989 the first free elections took place for two vacant deputies' seats in Šiauliai. One of them has been won by Sąjūdis supported independent candidate Zigmas Vaišvila.[4]

On 26 March 1989 elections took place for 42 seats in the Congress of People's Deputies. Despite the Easter Sunday celebrations and boycott by dissident organizations such as the Lithuanian Liberty League, the turnout reached 82.5%.[5] The results were a sweeping victory to Sąjūdis: 36 out of its 39 candidates won against the Communist Party of Lithuania (CPL) (some of these candidates were CPL members themselves).[5] The communists won only 6 seats; two of them were uncontested, as Sąjūdis withdrew its candidates in favor of Algirdas Brazauskas and Vladimiras Beriozovas.[5] CPL, shaken by the defeat, was losing authority and membership. To save the party, its leader Brazauskas moved closer to the pro-independence movements.[6] By the summer of 1989, the party supported calls for ""sovereignty"" and cooperated with Sąjūdis.

On 29 September 1989 the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR Deputies' Election Act was passed. It reduced future Supreme Soviet by 60 per cent (from 350 to 141 members) and eliminated deputies from local government soviets and various organisations in the process.[7] At the same day, election day to the new Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR was proposed on 24 February 1990,[8] what will be done on 23 November 1989.[9] Initially, appointment (not electing) over one third of all deputies was proposed, but, due to public pressure, this proposal was not put in Election Act.[10]

On 7 December 1989 the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, then almost fully controlled by CPL, amended the Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR eliminating Article 6, which established communist party monopoly in political life.[11] At the same day, Article 7, which established participation of the Lithuanian Komsomol in political life (including elections), was amended as well.[12] These decisions meant that Lithuania eliminated legal obstacles for a multi-party system and allowed other parties to compete in the upcoming parliamentary elections.

During its 20th congress on 19–20 December the CPL separated itself from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) by a vote of 855 to 160.[13] For such insubordination, Brazauskas was scolded in a special session of the Central Committee of CPSU and Mikhail Gorbachev made a personal visit to Lithuania to heal the rift in January 1990.[14] However, such measures changed little and CPL (independent) kept slowly pushing for independence. This political divorce was not approved by hardline communists. They established a separate CPL, which was still part of the CPSU, and claimed to be the legal successor of the ""real"" CPL.[15] This pro-Moscow group was led by Mykolas Burokevičius and included disproportionately large numbers of representatives from Russian and Polish minorities.[13]

Members of the Supreme Soviet were elected from single-member constituencies by two-round system. Second round has been used or repeated if no candidate reach 50 per cent of all votes given or less than 50 per cent of all registered voters, who voted in constituency.

The main competition was between Sąjūdis and CPL (independent). While both camps agreed on the eventual goal of independent Lithuania, Sąjūdis advocated acting quickly without fearing Moscow's reaction and CPL campaigned for a step-by-step approach to avoid conflict with Moscow.[16] Even though Sąjūdis was not a political party and was not reflected in any official statistics,[17] its endorsements had an immense influence on candidate's electability because the votes would be cast not for party lists, but for specific personalities.[18] Such endorsements would be handed out based on personal merits and without regard to political affiliation.[3] Therefore, a number of CPL members was backed by Sąjūdis. Other parties were formed just recently and did not enjoy widespread popularity. Of all parties participating, only CPL (CPSU) did not support Lithuanian independence.[19]

A total of 522 candidates registered for the election, but 50 dropped out before the election day.[20] Of the remaining 472 candidates, 201 were proposed by the CPL (independent), 139 were nonpartisans, and 79 were listed by CPL (CPSU).[17]

A total of 90 delegates were elected in the first round. In 51 constituencies, the run-off elections were held in early March. Originally scheduled for 10 March, the run-off was pushed forward whenever possible so that the Supreme Soviet could meet as soon as possible (all run-offs were held on 4, 7–10 March).[21] Due to low voter turnout (primarily in areas where Polish and Russian minorities concentrated), elections in six constituencies were invalid.[22]

Of the 135 members elected, 91 had been endorsed by Sąjūdis, including 58 of the 64 independents, 17 of the independent Communists, all elected members of the Social Democrats, Greens and Christian Democrats, and one of the three Democratic Party members.[1][a]

Immediately after the first round, elected delegates gathered for semi-formal discussions and consultations. Some of the critical decisions were made during these ""tea talks"" between the first and second rounds of the election.[26] The Supreme Soviet was to convene as soon as possible (two weeks after the election) and declare independence without delay. The Lithuanians were afraid that during the scheduled assembly of the Congress of People's Deputies on 12 March 1990, Gorbachev would be appointed as the President of the Soviet Union and would gain greater powers within the union.[27] Specifically, Lithuanians feared that Gorbachev would pass a law on secession that would make it virtually impossible to break away from the Soviet Union.[28] At the time of its first gathering on 10 March, the final results of the run-off election were not yet available.[20]

During the first session, the delegates elected a commission to verify the election results. As verification was a time-consuming process, the Supreme Soviet adjourned until 09:00 the next morning.[20] On 11 March the Supreme Soviet elected Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of Sąjūdis, as its chairman (91 votes) against Algirdas Brazauskas, leader of CPL, (38 votes).[29] On the same day  the Soviet changed its name to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, re-adopted interwar coat of arms, and passed the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania (124 votes in favor, 6 abstentions, none opposed).[29] It also abolished Soviet constitutions and re-adopted the Lithuanian Constitution of 1938, the last constitution before the Soviet occupation. It was a symbolic move to emphasize the legal continuity of the interwar state as the Constitution of 1938 was suspended minutes later and replaced by the Provisional Fundamental Law, based on the Constitution of Lithuanian SSR proposals of 1989.[30][31] Thus Lithuania officially declared its independence from the Soviet Union.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_Lithuanian_Supreme_Soviet_election
Simonas Daukantas,"Simonas Daukantas (Polish: Szymon Dowkont; 28 October 1793 – 6 December 1864) was a Lithuanian/Samogitian historian, writer, and ethnographer. One of the pioneers of the Lithuanian National Revival, he is credited as the author of the first book on the history of Lithuania written in the Lithuanian language. Only a few of his works were published during his lifetime and he died in obscurity. However, his works were rediscovered during the later stages of the National Revival. His views reflected the three major trends of the 19th century: romanticism, nationalism, and liberalism.[1]

Daukantas was born in Samogitia to a Lithuanian family. Likely a son of free peasants, he later produced proof of his noble birth to get university degree and a promotion in his government job. He attended schools in Kretinga and Žemaičių Kalvarija and was noted as an excellent student. Daukantas studied law at the University of Vilnius, though his interest lay in philology and history. After the graduation, he worked as a civil servant of the Russian Empire from 1825 to 1850. He first worked at the office of the Governor-General of Livonia, Estonia and Courland in Riga then moved to Saint Petersburg to work at the Governing Senate. At the Senate, he had the opportunity to study the Lithuanian Metrica, the state archive of the 14–18th century legal documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1850, Daukantas retired from his job due to poor health and moved back to Samogitia where he lived in Varniai under the care of bishop Motiejus Valančius for a few years. He hoped to publish some of his works with bishop's help, but the bishop prioritized religious work and they began to quarrel. In 1855, Daukantas moved to Jaunsvirlauka [lv] in present-day Latvia and later to Papilė where he died in obscurity in 1864.

While Daukantas knew seven languages, he published exclusively in Lithuanian. He was a prolific writer and worked on a wide range of books – studies on the history of Lithuania, publications of primary historical sources, collections of Lithuanian folklore, Polish–Lithuanian dictionaries, Latin textbook for schoolchildren, primer of the Lithuanian language, Catholic prayer book, agricultural manuals for peasants, translations of classical Roman texts, novel for youth inspired by Robinson Crusoe. However, only a few of these works were published during his lifetime. Of the four studies on history, he managed to publish only one, The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians, in 1845. While he was a well read erudite who spent considerable time and effort in obtaining primary sources, his historical works are highly influenced by romantic nationalism and didactically idealize the past. He used poetic descriptions, rhetorical elements, and emotional language that brought his history works closer to a literary work. His histories are valued not for their scientific content, but for their contribution to the development of the Lithuanian national identity.[2] After the closing of Vilnius University in 1832, Lithuanians did not have a professionally trained historian until 1904 and used Daukantas' histories extensively. Daukantas identified language as the determining factor of nationality and articulated the nationalist anti-Polish sentiment that became the fundamental ideas of the Lithuanian National Revival and that survive in Lithuanian historiography into the 21st century.[3]

Daukantas was born on 28 October 1793 in Kalviai [lt] near Lenkimai in Samogitia. He was the oldest of seven children (two sons and five daughters).[4] With Daukantas' help, his brother Aleksandras later studied medicine at Vilnius University.[5] Baptismal records of the two sons (but not of the daughters) specified that they were children of Lithuanian nobles.[6] There was an academic debate whether this information was accurate or falsified to provide the sons with better opportunities in life, a common practice among wealthier peasants at the time.[7] An analysis of inventories of Skuodas Manor revealed that the family were free peasants – different from serfs in that they had some personal freedoms and paid quit-rent instead of performing corvée. When the manor was confiscated from the Sapiehas for their participation in the Uprising of 1831, the family was turned into serfs.[8] However, Eimantas Meilus argued that inventories alone do not prove that the family was not of noble origin as many poorer nobles were equated to peasants and paid quit-rent to wealthier manors.[9] The family worked about 1.5 voloks of land and pasture and raised cash for quit-rent by selling flax in Riga or Liepāja.[10] According to the epitaph engraved on the gravestone of Daukantas' mother, she and her husband participated in a battle near Liepāja during the Kościuszko Uprising against the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[4] In 1799–1800, his father was mentioned as manor's forester.[11]

Daukantas' education was financed by his uncle, priest Simonas Lopacinskis (died in 1814).[12] Daukantas attended a two-year primary school in Kretinga. When the school was visited by an inspector from Vilnius University in 1808, Daukantas was listed among 16 exemplary second-year students (out of total 68 students).[12] The school curriculum included lessons on Polish and Latin grammar, geography, arithmetic, religion and morality.[13] At some point, Daukantas enrolled into a four-grade six-year (the last two grades took two years to finish) school in Žemaičių Kalvarija. Another inspector listed him as one of four best students in the last fourth grade in 1814.[14] The school curriculum was dictated by Vilnius University and included natural law (textbook by Hieronim Stroynowski), classical antiquity, rhetoric, geography, geometry, algebra, physics, natural sciences (textbook by Stanisław Bonifacy Jundziłł), gardening. However, since all teachers were Dominican friars, students had to attend daily masses and go to confession every month.[15] The subjects were taught in Polish and the use of Samogitian (Lithuanian), even among students, was prohibited in November 1806. The official rationale was to facilitate the learning of Polish.[16] However, as later attested by Motiejus Valančius, neither students nor teachers knew Polish well and Daukantas never learned proper Polish pronunciation.[17]

In 1814, Daukantas with 10 rubles in his pocket and a bag of clothes on his back traveled on foot from Samogitia to Vilnius to attend Vilnius Gymnasium. The school year started on 1 September, but Daukantas was registered only on 26 September as a fifth-year student.[18] That school year, the school had 423 students, mostly sons of nobles and officials. The gymnasium, together with Vilnius in general, was recovering after the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Its original premises were occupied by a war hospital and so it temporarily shared rooms with Vilnius University.[19] In June–July 1815, the gymnasium organized an annual public examination of its students attended by members of the clergy and university professors. Daukantas was listed among 14 students who distinguished themselves during this event.[20] He successfully graduated from the gymnasium in early summer 1816.[20]

In fall 1816, Daukantas began studies at the Faculty of Literature and Liberal Arts at Vilnius University, then known as the Imperial University of Vilna. Adam Mickiewicz transferred to the faculty at the same time.[21] Daukantas was interested in philology and studied Latin, Russian, and Polish literature, French language, rhetoric, poetry, natural and land law (leges patrias).[22] His professors included Gottfried Ernst Groddeck [de] of classical philology and Leon Borowski [pl] of poetry and rhetoric.[23] In 1817, Daukantas applied for a Candidate of Philosophy degree, but was rejected because he did not provide required certificates and did not complete a thesis.[24] After another year of studies, Daukantas transferred to the Faculty of Moral and Political Sciences in fall 1818. These studies could secure a more promising career as a judge or a government official.[25] He attended lectures of Ignacy Żegota Onacewicz [ru], who formed Daukantas as a historian. Onacewicz studied at the University of Königsberg and had access to the archives of the Teutonic Order and spent a year studying archives at the estate of Nikolay Rumyantsev in Gomel. He collected enough information to establish a course on the history of Lithuania as a separate subject from the history of Poland.[26] Another key professor was Ignacy Daniłowicz [ru] who taught law and studied Lithuanian Statutes, Casimir's Code, and Lithuanian Chronicles.[27]

On 12 July 1819, Daukantas was granted the Candidate of Law degree in canon and Roman law.[28] To get the diploma, Daukantas needed to provide proof of his noble status.[29] He provided a large parchment, signed by Michał Józef Römer as marshal of the szlachta of the Vilna Governorate on 24 August 1820, that described an extensive genealogy of Daukantai family of Olawa coat of arms [pl] that traced back to the late 1500s.[30] While the document is authentic, historian Vytautas Merkys concluded that Daukantas altered the genealogy to attach his own family to the noble Daukantai family, another known practice among peasants that shared surnames with noble families.[31] Daukantas received his diploma on 25 January 1821.[28]

He continued his studies and took canon law, Roman civil law, criminal law, land law, political economy, history, logic and metaphysics. From fall 1820, Daukantas stopped attending lectures except for land law. He stopped taking classes in spring 1822.[32] In all classes he received ""good"" or ""very good"" evaluations except in logic and metaphysics taught by Anioł Dowgird where his knowledge was rated as ""satisfactory"".[33] In spring 1821, Daukantas submitted an application for a master's degree.[34] The oral exams took place in October–November 1821. He had to answer questions on a wide variety of subjects, from the law and history of Ancient Rome and impostors of Dmitry of Uglich to theory of taxes and specifics of Russian economy as well as thoughts of Montesquieu and Adam Smith.[35] In July 1822, Daukantas defended his thesis on the power of the head of a family according to the natural, Roman, and land law. He was granted the master's degree in canon and Roman law on 15 July 1822.[36]

However, Daukantas had to wait until 1825 to get his diploma. The degree needed a confirmation by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education. The university prepared the papers in August 1822, but they were returned because they needed translation into Russian. The translated documents were not sent out until March 1824.[37] Part of the delay was caused by suppression of the Filomat and Filaret secret student societies (Daukantas' name was included on a list of potential members, but there is no evidence that he ever joined them).[38] Discovered in May 1823, members of these societies were tried and sentenced for anti-Tsarist activities. Until resolution of the trials, students were prohibited from leaving Vilnius and the university ceased issuing graduation certificates.[39] The process was delayed again due to the replacement of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, curator of the Vilnius educational district [ru], with Nikolay Novosiltsev. The papers had to be reviewed by the new curator who approved Daukantas' degree in February 1825 followed by the ministry's approval in March. Finally, the university issued the diploma on 30 April 1825.[40]

There is no reliable information on Daukantas' activities while he waited for his diploma. Earlier biographers claimed that he studied at the University of Dorpat, but researchers Vaclovas Biržiška and Antanas Tyla [lt] found no record of Daukantas among Dorpat students.[41] Jonas Šliūpas claimed that Daukantas visited France, Germany, England,[42] while other authors claimed that he studied historical documents at the Königsberg archives,[43][44] but there is no record that he was issued a passport that would have allowed him to leave Vilnius.[42] Daukantas likely joined a small circle of Samogitian students that promised to promote Lithuanian language and culture signifying the early stages of the Lithuanian National Revival.[38] There a popular legend that he went to the Gate of Dawn and promised to write only in Lithuanian.[45] Already in 1822, he wrote Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), an 855-page manuscript on the history of Lithuania. While it was not published until 1929, two copies of the manuscript are known.[46] Researcher Roma Bončkutė proposed that Daukantas was inspired to write the work after reading The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis, first published by Ludwig Rhesa in 1818.[47] In 1824, Daukantas translated 111 fables of Phaedrus, but they remained unpublished until 1846.[48]

With his master's diploma in hand, Daukantas searched for a position in a government office. In September 1825, he was issued a passport that allowed him to travel to the Governorates of Livonia and Saint Petersburg.[49] He found a post at the office of the Governor-General of Livonia, Estonia and Courland in Riga.[42] All government officials in the Russian Empire were divided into 14 categories, from imperial ministers to train conductors (see: Table of Ranks). In 1826, Daukantas was recognized as a titular councillor, 9th category official. For a promotion to collegiate assessor he needed to prove his noble status and have three years of experience.[50] In February 1826, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia ordered to prepare a new law that would require all nobles to prove their social status. While the law was adopted only in May 1834, it became a lot more difficult to prove one's noble birth.[51] Daukantas and his brother Aleksandras, then a student at Vilnius University, had to resubmit all documents proving their genealogy to a special commission of Vilna Governorate.[52] The commission recognized both brothers as nobles and forwarded documents to Heroldia [ru] under the Governing Senate in January 1832. In May 1833, Heroldia recognized Daukantas as noble, but not his brother.[53] Daukantas was promoted to the 8th category in April 1834.[50]

During the Uprising of 1831, Daukantas was in Riga – he was not granted vacations between December 1829 and July 1834.[54] In 1833, he received two awards of 75 and 110 rubles for excellent work. We was interested in the history of Lithuania, but could not get access to the archives of Riga magistrate. After the promotion, he decided to change his position and move to Saint Petersburg.[55] He applied for a job at the first (administrative) department of the Governing Senate. After a background check to ensure that he did not participate in the uprising, Daukantas started his new job in March 1835. He worked on paperwork related to ports and Russian Imperial Navy.[56] In March 1837, he transferred to the third department which dealt with all kinds of cases, complaints, and appeals from eastern governorates of the Russian Empire, including Vilna and Kovno. Daukantas was attracted to this position because the office used Lithuanian Metrica, a collection of the 14–18th century legal documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[57] He became an assistant of Franciszek Malewski. His annual salary was 286 rubles with additional 57 rubles for food.[58] It was a small pay and Daukantas earned additional money by helping various people to locate needed genealogical and other documents in the Metrica.[59] In July 1839, Daukantas received an award equal to his annual pay for helping create a practical index of the Metrica. However, he did not receive either Order of Saint Anna (2nd class) or the Order of Saint Stanislaus (2nd class) which were generally awarded after 12 and 15 years of employment.[60]

In February 1841, Daukantas' brother Aleksandras was implicated in an anti-Tsarist organization established by Szymon Konarski. After an interrogation, he attempted suicide and was brought to a hospital in Kherson. He died in the hospital on 5 October 1841.[61] More repressions and restrictions, including stricter censorship, followed after the Revolutions of 1848.[62] Afraid of attracting police attention and losing his job, Daukantas kept his historical research a secret and always asked friends and acquaintances not to publish or mention his name.[63] He used numerous non-repeating pen names and a few times published works without any name, though some researchers suggested that he also did that to create an impression that there were many Lithuanian writers.[64] Even when sending a copy of Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių to Teodor Narbutt, Daukantas described the work as if written by an unknown person.[63]

In Saint Petersburg, Daukantas worked on his studies on the history of Lithuania and was close friends with his former professor Ignacy Żegota Onacewicz [ru] and Vasily Anastasevich [ru] who both lived in an apartment provided by the Rumyantsev Museum.[65] They both died in February 1845 and Daukantas deeply mourned his friends.[66] When Vilnius Theological Academy was moved to Saint Petersburg in 1842, it brought more Lithuanian intellectuals to Saint Petersburg. Daukantas is often crediting for inspiring Motiejus Valančius, future Bishop of Samogitia, to write his works in Lithuanian.[67] The small Samogitian circle was ruined when Jonas Krizostomas Gintila [lt] and Valančius returned to Lithuania in 1844–1845.[68] However, Daukantas and Valančius continued to correspond and collaborate. It is likely that Valančius wrote his fundamental work on the history of the Diocese of Samogitia in Lithuanian and not in Polish because of Daukantas' influence. In this work, Valančius cited Daukantas' manuscript of Istorija žemaitiška four times and Lithuanian Metrica (copies of which he could have obtained only from Daukantas) another four times,[69] though likely used Daukantas and his sources more frequently as Valančius mentioned a total of 19 Samogitian cities and towns that had received royal privileges.[70]

Teodor Narbutt, author of the nine-volume History of Lithuania, began corresponding with Daukantas in March 1842.[71] They exchanged books and materials. In total, Narbutt wrote 19 letters to Daukantas, and Daukantas wrote 20 letters to Narbutt.[72] Their main concern was to obtain and publish historical documents and other primary sources related to the history of Lithuania. Daukantas was particularly wary of falsified or altered sources being published by various Polish historians.[73] Their plan to publish primary sources was an intentional and principled decision to publish Lithuanian documents separately from Polish historians who began publishing Sources for the History of Poland (Źródła do dziejów Polski).[74] Daukantas sent to Narbutt about 800 copies[75] of various documents made during the years by himself or by Onacewicz,[76] including a copy of Die Littauischen Wegeberichte.[64] In particular, he highly valued a copy of a manuscript by Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz that cataloged and described various coat of arms of Lithuanian nobility. When Narbutt promised to find a way to publish the manuscript, Daukantas lent him the copy for a few months with strict orders to supervise the publication so that no Polish publishers could make any changes or alterations to the original text.[77] Narbutt harbored plans to publish the Bychowiec Chronicle as the first volume of a series of primary source publications, but Daukantas lost his patience after receiving only promises of ever grander plans.[78] Their collaboration broke down in 1844.[72] Narbutt never published or returned the documents received from Daukantas who was angry over losing most valuable pieces of his collection and continued to demand their return until 1858.[79] After Narbutt's death, his sons gifted some of the primary sources collected by their father, including 158 pages copied by Daukantas, to a library in Lviv (present-day Stefanyk National Science Library).[80]

In an 1846 letter to Narbutt, Daukantas complained of poor health which he attributed to long hours spent in cold and damp archives of the Russian Senate. He complained that he had difficulty walking, but dismissed doctors' diagnosis of podagra.[81] In summer 1850, he requested a three-month vacation to improve his health. In September, he obtained an official certificate from a German doctor in Telšiai that at the age of 58 and troubled by many ailments he was unfit to continue his work in Saint Petersburg.[82] Daukantas was officially retired in February 1851 and allotted an annual pension of 42.90 silver rubles, but it was not enough to live on and he needed further financial support.[83] His move to Lithuania coincided with the consecration of his old friend Motiejus Valančius as Bishop of Samogitia in March 1850. Daukantas lived in Varniai where Valnčius resided and which was becoming a cultural center in Samogitia.[84] He received a salary of 200 rubles from Valančius and worked on his historical studies that he hoped to publish with Valančius' help.[85] However, soon the relationship soured perhaps because Valančius prioritized religious work and literature and would assign tasks which had little to do with Lithuanian cultural work that Daukantas desired.[86] Also, Valančius had a more critical approach to writing history and reportedly criticized Daukantas' overly idealized work[64] and carefully controlled the language of Daukantas' historical works.[87]

In summer 1855, Daukantas moved from Varniai. Historians usually cite the conflict between Daukantas and Valančius as the reason for the move, but ill health and fear of police persecution probably also contributed.[88] Due to the Crimean War, Russian police became more vigilant and they came across Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių that Daukantas had published in 1845.[89] The censors reevaluated the book and deemed it inappropriate due to its anti-serfdom rhetoric. The police tracked down Daukantas and knew that he moved from Varniai to Courland. However, the book was already sold out and the investigation concluded with an order to keep an eye on bookstores in case a new edition of the book appeared.[90] The book was one of the first books added to a list of prohibited books compiled in October 1855.[91]

Daukantas moved to Jaunsvirlauka [lv] (German: Neu-Bergfried) in present-day Latvia to live with Petras Smuglevičius, a medical doctor and a relative of painter Franciszek Smuglewicz. Smuglevičius was accused of belonging to a secret student society, arrested for a year, later acquitted, but still lived under police supervision.[88] He was very supportive of Lithuanian cultural activities. In early 1858, Mikalojus Akelaitis also moved in to live with Smuglevičius. Akelaitis treated Daukantas as a fatherly figure and they supported each other's work.[92]  Daukantas continued to work on his historical studies, writing to linguist Friedrich Kurschat in hopes of obtaining books by Ludwig Rhesa and Daniel Klein and copies of historical sources from Johannes Voigt.[93] He compiled a collection of historical documents, privileges from 1387–1561 that he had inherited from Jerzy Konstanty Plater [lt], and made one last attempt to collect the document he loaned to Teodor Narbutt.[94] Daukantas supported the establishment of the Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius and corresponded with Eustachy Tyszkiewicz hoping to transfer some of his collected historical documents to the museum.[95] Akelaitis, Valančius, and Daukantas wanted to establish Pakeleivingas, a Lithuanian-language periodical aimed at the ordinary village people, but could not get government's permission.[96] Daukantas had four manuscripts ready to be published (two booklets with agricultural advice, Lithuanian reworking of Robinson Crusoe, and a second edition of a Lithuanian primer), but they all remained unpublished due to lack of funds.[97]

Around summer 1859, Daukantas left Jaunsvirlauka and briefly lived with various friends and relatives.[98] In October 1861, he moved to Papilė to live with Ignotas Vaišvila, a parish priest.[99] His health continued to deteriorate. Daukantas and Valančius exchanged final bitter letters in 1861, completely severing their friendship. One of these letters was later published in Aušra.[100] It is unclear what Daukantas did during the January Uprising of 1863–1864, but several of his friends were arrested, imprisoned, or exiled to Siberia. Vaišvila was arrested, but released.[101] Daukantas died on 6 December 1864 and was buried on the summit of the Papilė hill fort without much ceremony. Vaišvila put a simple engraved stone on the grave; twenty years later, he replaced it with an engraved ledger gravestone commissioned in Riga which survives to this day.[102] In 1925, Antanas Raudonis, a former Lithuanian book smuggler and an amateur sculptor, added a cross that is shaped as an oak stump with a growing shoot.[103]

Daukantas wrote four original books on the history of Lithuania. Only one of them was published during his lifetime. In his research, Daukantas was hindered by inaccessibility of sources, lack of funds, absent institutional support (i.e. no government institution or university to assist him). It was a lonely, costly, and frustrating undertaking.[104] Book publishing was an expensive undertaking. For example, Daukantas had to pay 2,000 silver rubles to the publisher of his 120-page Latin grammar.[105] The only person known to have provided financial assistance to Daukantas is Ksaveras Kanapackis,[91] who is listed as sponsor of ten books by Daukantas.[105]

He wrote his first historical work, Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių (Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians and Samogitians), in 1822 while still a student at Vilnius University. The work starts with the 7th century BC and ends with the death of King Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło) in 1434.[106] The work was discovered in 1919[107] and first published in 1929.[108] The work was dedicated not to historians or learned men, but to Lithuanian mothers who taught their children and told them deeds of their ancestors.[46] Thus he recognized and acknowledged women's role in educating the younger generation.[109]

His second and largest historical work, Istorija žemaitiška (Samogitian History), was completed by 1834. The manuscript had 1,106 pages. It appears that Daukantas hoped to publish it around 1848 as he ordered a clean copy, which was discovered in 1983.[110] The work ended with the death of Sigismund II Augustus in 1572.[106] Istorija žemaitiška under the title Lietuvos istorija (History of Lithuania) was published in two volumes in 1893 and 1897 in the United States.[111] In 1850, Daukantas reworked it as Pasakojimas apie veikalus lietuvių tautos senovėje (Story of the Deeds of the Ancient Lithuanians) which ended with the death of Grand Duke Vytautas in 1430.[112] He hoped to publish it with the help of Motiejus Valančius and two copies with various corrections were produced. In 1882, Jonas Šliūpas made another copy with hopes of publishing it,[113] but the first 96 pages up to year 1201 were printed by Jonas Kriaučiūnas at the press of Martynas Jankus in 1893 and the work was first published in full only in 1976.[112] It was the only manuscript that Daukantas signed in his real name (though he also used pen name Jonas Einoras).[64]

His third historical book was Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių (The Character of the Ancient Lithuanians, Highlanders, and Samogitians). He created the word kalnėnai (highlanders) to refer to Aukštaitija.[114] Russian censors considered the manuscript in May 1844, but due to difficulties finding censors who knew Lithuanian, the work approved only in March 1845. The book was published in Saint Petersburg in February 1846.[115] It was republished in the United States in 1892 and in Lithuania in 1935.[64] It was the first history of the culture of Lithuania.[116] Excerpts were translated to Polish in Rocznik Literacki in 1850 and to German in Mitteilungen der Litauischen literarischen Gesellschaft in 1885.[117] The content was arranged not chronologically as in other works but thematically with chapters covering subjects such as religion, customs, commerce, geography.[111] The short chapter on numismatics, which discussed the Lithuanian long currency and earliest coins of the Grand Duchy, retained its scientific relevance until the 1930s.[118] The book described material and spiritual life of Lithuanians in poetic, literary language.[111] Excerpts of this work are often included in reading materials for Lithuanian literature lessons in Lithuanian schools.[119]

Daukantas was one of the first to clearly distinguish a nation from a state. He believed that a nation is defined by its language and customs, not statehood.[120] His histories were not about a territory that no longer existed (and that was mourned by Adam Mickiewicz), but about the living nation.[121] As long as Lithuanian language and customs (folklore, songs, tales, proverbs) existed, the Lithuanian nation would also survive.[43] Daukanatas proposed than developing culture and pursuing education, not just military or political means, were forms of resistance.[109] Therefore, he associated the Lithuanian national identity not with the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but with the Lithuanian language, folk culture, and customs – an idea that was further pursued by the Lithuanian National Revival and led to the formation of the independent Lithuania in 1918.[122] He further held liberal ideas that people were born with inalienable rights and that there was a social contract between a nation and the state.[1] He thought that peasants and other commoners were the core of a nation thus going against the Polish trend to emphasize the nation of nobles.[120][45]

His primary goal was to inspire love of the homeland and Lithuanian national pride among the common folk.[123] He used poetic and lively descriptions, rhetorical elements, monologues and dialogues, and emotional language that brought his history works closer to a literary work.[64] Particularly artistic are wild forest and battle scenes.[124] Daukantas painted an idealized image of ancient Lithuanians who embodied stoic values and lived peacefully in their vast forests until the nobility adopted foreign customs, became lazy, and started exploiting the common folk.[125][126] This depiction echoed ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Gottfried Herder that the savage, unspoiled by the civilization, was inherently noble and good.[127] He depicted Grand Duke Vytautas as the great Lithuanian hero while King Jogaila, who initiated the Polish–Lithuanian union in 1385, was a symbol of all ills and evils that later befell Lithuania.[128] He blamed Poland and Polish nobility for Lithuania losing its statehood, moral enslavement of Lithuanians, and falsification and distortions of Lithuania's history.[129][130] Poland brought economic decline and moral decay to Lithuania – the opposite of the common Polish claim that they ""civilized"" the pagan barbarians.[131] Such strong anti-Polish sentiment was a radical and daring development among Lithuanians[43] at the time when Polish intellectuals considered the Polish–Lithuanian union to be sacred,[132] but it paved the way for separating the dual Polish-Lithuanian identity into the modern Polish and Lithuanian national identities.[133] Daukantas identified language as the determining factor of nationality.[1] After the publication of Aušra in 1883, such anti-Polish attitudes became increasingly common among Lithuanian activists.[134]

Daukantas idealized and idolized the past.[43] Virgil Krapauskas asserted that Daukantas' letters to Narbutt showed Daukantas to be a better scholar than his works – in the letters Daukantas emphasized the need for better methods of collecting, publishing and analyzing primary sources, though his works remained highly romantic and didactic.[135] Daukantas spent considerable effort in tracking down various historical documents,[64] but he believed that where historical records are missing, historians should use their imagination to fill in the gaps.[136] If a source was favorable to Lithuania, he did not evaluate it critically and readily accepted a number of legends. For example, he elaborated on the theory that Lithuanians were descendants of Herules that he took from Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz (though he rejected the legend about Roman Palemonids),[137] praised ancient democracy of Prussian king Widewuto,[138] and used a loose translation of the short story Żiwila by Adam Mickiewicz.[91] But he was critical of sources that portrayed Lithuania in a negative light.[139] For example, he was one of the first to criticize the Teutonic account of the Battle of Strėva as a crushing defeat of Lithuanian forces or argue that the Lithuanian returned to the Battle of Grunwald and continued to fight.[140] While Daukantas' scholarship was poor and does not stand up to modern standards, it was on par with his contemporaries.[141]

Overall, Daukantas' historical works were mostly influenced by the two-volume Historiae Lituanae by Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz (published in 1650 and 1669) from which he borrowed the structure, content, rhetorical and stylistic elements. He also borrowed poetic elements from Kristijonas Donelaitis[142] Daukantas cited his sources erratically and inconsistently.[143] Darbai senųjų lietuvių ir žemaičių had 254 references: 89 to works by August von Kotzebue, 62 to Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz, 29 to Nikolay Karamzin, 15 to Antoni Hlebowicz [pl], and 10 to Teodor Narbutt, in total 31 authors.[144] Istorija žemaitiška cited 320 references; the number of different authors grew to about 70, mostly German historians. There was a shift in references used: von Kotzebue (18 references) fell out of favor and was replaced by Johannes Voigt (75 references) while Hlebowicz was not cited at all.[145] At times, he went beyond citing sources and outright plagiarized works by Kojałowicz, Kotzebue, Voigt.[143] Daukantas also added a number of citations to primary sources, including the Lithuanian Chronicles, Livonian Rhymed Chronicle, chronicles by Wigand of Marburg, Peter von Dusburg, Lucas David.[146] Towards the end of the manuscript, the citations became scarcer and rarer. There were only five references, including two to Jan Łasicki, for 227 pages covering the period from 1440 to 1572.[64]

In Būdas senovės lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių, Daukantas cited a few documents from the Lithuanian Metrica, but perhaps was afraid to cite it more often as it could have attracted unwanted attention from the Tsarist authorities that he was using his access to the Metrica for non-work related purposes (the Metrica was carefully guarded to avoid any alterations or falsifications).[147] In this work, Daukantas expanded his bibliography by adding references to De moribus tartarorum, lituanorum et moscorum, Livonian Chronicle of Henry, works by Alexander Guagnini and Jan Łasicki, and others.[146] He also used Lithuanian folklore, etymologies, and semantics as a source.[138] While Daukantas cited a wide range of works and authors, including some classical historians such as Tacitus or Ptolemy, he avoided citing Polish historians who supported the union between Poland and Lithuania and considered Lithuania to be just a region of Poland. In particular, he disliked and barely cited Jan Długosz.[145] Overall, Daukantas was an erudite and well-read person, familiar with both classical and new western sources.[143] He knew seven languages: Lithuanian, Russian, Polish, Latin, German, Latvian, and French.[122]

In addition to the brief Latin–Lithuanian dictionary published in 1838, Daukantas compiled three other dictionaries, but they were not published.[148] Lithuanians still used the Polish–Latin–Lithuanian dictionary by Konstantinas Sirvydas first published in 1620. Therefore, Daukantas was not the only Lithuanian to start a new Polish–Lithuanian dictionary. Mikalojus Akelaitis, Laurynas Ivinskis, Dionizas Poška, Simonas Stanevičius, Kiprijonas Nezabitauskis, and others are known to have started compiling a dictionary but their works were similarly not published.[149] Daukantas' entries did not provide lexicographic information (for example, gender of nouns) and had very few illustrative examples of how a certain word is used in a sentence. These lexicographic weaknesses reveal Daukantas' tendency to focus solely on words at the price of grammar, syntax, or style.[150] He wanted to demonstrate that Lithuanian language is rich in words and is an equal of other languages, but neglected practical aspects of the dictionaries.[151]

Sometime in 1838–1846,[152] Daukantas worked on a Polish–Lithuanian dictionary that possibly contained about 23,000 words. Only a fragment with 2,244 words has been preserved. The Polish list of words was borrowed from a dictionary published by Jan Litwiński in 1815.[153] Around 1842–1850, he worked on compiling a Lithuanian–Latin dictionary. The unfinished work contains 3,977 words and stops at the word Gwĩldós.[154] Around 1850–1855, Daukantas compiled a three-volume 2,280-page Polish–Lithuanian dictionary. It is unfinished and, according to the count by Jonas Kruopas, contains 56,567 Polish words but only 37,677 Lithuanian equivalents.[155] For the base list of Polish words, Daukantas used the Polish–French dictionary by Stanisław Ropelewski [pl] published in 1847.[156] The manuscript of the last dictionary was transferred by Daukantas' relatives to the Lithuanian Scientific Society in 1911.[157] There it was studied by Kazimieras Būga who picked out Lithuanian words, sometimes not known from anywhere else, for his planned Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian.[158] The three volumes of the Polish–Lithuanian dictionary were first published in 1993–1996.[159]

From his own experience, Daukantas understood that Lithuanian students struggled learning Latin because they had to use Polish textbooks and many Lithuanians did not speak Polish before entering school.[160] Therefore, in 1837, he published a 120-page grammar book on Latin. It started with a basic introduction to the Lithuanian grammar on which then Latin grammar rules were built on. Thus, at the same time, it was one of the first textbooks of Lithuanian grammar.[161] In 1838, Daukantas published Epitome historiae sacrae by the French author Charles François Lhomond[161] and added a 42-page Latin–Lithuanian dictionary with about 2,350 Latin words and 250 word combinations[148] and 3,880 Lithuanian words and 260 word combinations.[162] The book was meant as a supplemental Latin reading for school students.[161] It was a popular work that was frequently published with a dictionary. Daukantas did not compile the Latin list of words, but translated it from a Polish edition.[163]

In 1841, Tsarist authorities, looking to weaken the Polish culture, allowed Samogitian Diocese to establish parish schools that could teach Lithuanian language.[164] In 1842, Daukantas published 1,500 copies of Abėcėlė lietuvių, kalnėnų ir žemaičių kalbos (Alphabet of Lithuanian, Highlander, and Samogitian Language).[165] The primer included 18 pages dedicated to Russian language and sample reading material that was not religious.[166] While the book included the traditional prayers and catechism, it also added short moral teachings (e.g. to respect your parents), seven fables, and 298 Lithuanian proverbs. Some of these proverbs were rather crude and vulgar and had to be manually scratched out.[166] However, it was not popular. In a letter to Motiejus Valančius, Daukantas bitterly complained that less than 400 copies were sold in two years.[164] In 1849, Daukantas prepared a second edition of the primer that removed the non-religious texts, but the manuscript remained unclaimed at the censor's office.[167] Another edition was prepared in 1862 which returned the original text except for a few vulgar proverbs, but it could not be published due to the Lithuanian press ban.[168]

Daukantas prepared five other books for school students, but only two were published during his lifetime. He published a translation of fables by Phaedrus (he had them first translated in 1824) and a translation of biographies from De viris illustribus by Cornelius Nepos, both in 1846.[169] He published the fables with hopes of awakening an interest in Lithuanian folk tales.[170] He twice translated and reworked Robinson der Jüngere by Joachim Heinrich Campe (inspired by Robinson Crusoe) – first in 1846 as 397-page Rubinaičio Peliūzės gyvenimas (The Life of Rubinaitis Peliūžė; first published in 1984) and then in 1855 as 495-page Palangos Petris (Petris of Palanga; manuscript lost).[171][172] He adapted the text by changing names to Lithuanian names, geographic names to locations in Lithuania, aboriginal gods to pagan Lithuanian gods, and borrowing historical details from the Couronian colonization of the Americas, but otherwise remained faithful to Campe's text.[173] He also translated a work by the Roman historian Justin.[174]

Daukantas was passionate about the Lithuanian language and its purity. He was concerned that religious books, by far the most popular Lithuanian books at the time, were often translated by foreigners with poor knowledge of Lithuanian. As such, prayer book language was full of loanwords and barbarisms from various Slavic languages.[175] Therefore, in 1843, he undertook to prepare a prayer book – a rare feat for a layperson – in correct Lithuanian. He took prayers from various popular books of the time and submitted his manuscript to bishop Szymon Mikołaj Giedroyć [pl].[176] The manuscript received the approval from the diocese only in 1847, but for some unknown reason was not published.[177]

Daukantas was the first to collect examples of all genres (songs, proverbs, fairy-tales, etc.) of Lithuanian folklore.[178] He added Lithuanian proverbs to several of his works, but earlier works used proverbs already published by other authors. In total, he had prepared 932 proverbs for publication.[179] Around 1834–1835, Daukantas started one of the first collections of Lithuanian fairy tales, fables, humorous stories. The handwritten collection was discovered by Jonas Jablonskis and published in full in 1932.[180] Daukantas more frequently collected Lithuanian folk songs – about 850 songs collected by Daukantas are preserved, mostly at the Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania. In 1846, he published a collection of 118 songs and 190 proverbs.[181] Daukantas edited the songs freely, sometimes merging two songs together.[182] It was a popular book, only a few copies survive in Lithuanian libraries and all of those show heavy use. About 70 of these songs were republished by Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann in 1853 and six by August Schleicher in 1857.[183] Daukantas worked perhaps on three more volumes, but they remained unpublished.[184] Since Daukantas spent most of his time outside of Lithuania, he had to rely on local helpers (members of the intelligentsia or students) to visit the common villagers, write down samples of folklore, and send them to Daukantas. This way, the songs were collected by about 40 different people.[185] His collection of folklore was published in two volumes in 1983–1984.[186]

In 1847, Daukantas began translating and publishing booklets with agricultural advice in hopes that Lithuanian peasants could improve their economic conditions via more efficient and profitable farming methods.[187] They were the first practical steps towards the idea that economic development would lead to the development of the national consciousness.[133] He published works on tobacco and on hops in 1847. Next year, he re-published a book on beekeeping – it was already published in Lithuanian in 1801 and 1820.[188] In 1849, Daukantas published three booklets – on fruit trees by Johann Hermann Zigra [de], on tree seeds, and on fire prevention (it was first published in Lithuanian in 1802). The last book on fodder grasses was published in 1854. Daukantas had two more texts translated from Russian and Polish, but they were not published.[189] Daukantas added original introductions to these texts where he often returned to history. For example, the books about tree seeds and beekeeping talked about the ancient forests of Lithuania.[190]

Daukantas was passionate about the purity of the Lithuanian language.[191] To him it was the primary proof of the language's worth and importance at the time when it was marginalized and pushed out of public life by Polish and Russian. Language's practical use (ease of understanding, clear meaning, convenience) was of little importance.[191] In the early works, Daukantas wrote in the heavy Samogitian dialect (dounininkai sub-dialect) using plentiful diacritics and archaic words, some even borrowed from Latvian or Prussian.[192] Even his contemporaries, including fellow Samogitians Motiejus Valančius and Kajetonas Nezabitauskis, complained that they had difficulty understanding the language.[151] After 1845, when he started publishing popular booklets with agricultural advice, his language became less heavy, more similar to the Aukštaitian dialect.[192] His orthography is extremely varied and inconsistent, even in the same manuscript, as he experimented wanting to eliminate features of Polish and to include features of Prussian Lithuania orthography.[193]

Daukantas had to create numerous neologisms. The three volume Polish–Lithuanian dictionary contained about 3,800 neologisms.[150] As one of the first to write a grammar in Lithuanian, he had to create a number of grammatical terms.[194] Of the many neologism, a few became widely accepted and used in the modern standard Lithuanian, including laikrodis (clock), prekyba (trade), vaistininkas (pharmacist), vietovė (location), būdvardis (adjective), while many other were rejected, including aušrėnai (Balts), laikoskaitlis (chronology), rūdarbis (tailor).[159] He did not consider Latvian to be a foreign language and often borrowed its words, for example asinas from Latvian asins for blood, muižė from Latvian muiža for manor.[159] One of such borrowed words, valstybė for state or polity, became a standard Lithuanian word.[195] Daukantas was an amateur linguist and frequently offered etymologies that were based on similar sounding words instead of the scientific comparative method.[159]

While Daukantas died in obscurity and most of his works unpublished, growing Lithuanian National Revival celebrated his patriotism. Already in the first issue of Aušra, the first Lithuanian-language newspaper, Jonas Šliūpas started publishing multi-part biography of Daukantas and raised the idea of publishing his works.[196] Two historical studies by Daukantas were first published in Vienybė lietuvninkų and later in separate books by Lithuanian Americans in the 1890s.[197] Daukantas' life and work were studied by Eduards Volters, who presented a paper to the Imperial Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1887, Jonas Jablonskis, who published an article in Varpas in 1893, and by Mečislovas Davainis-Silvestraitis, who published a collection of documents about Daukantas in the United States in 1898.[198] In 1893, Lithuanian newspapers commemorated the 100th birth anniversary.[199] On that occasion, Davainis-Silvestraitis brought a painter to talk to people who knew Daukantas while he was alive and create his portrait. The resulting portrait, though of low artistic quality, was published in United States in an album compiled by Antanas Milukas.[200]

In 1901, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas discovered the only known contemporary portrait, painted around 1850. Based on this portrait, Petras Rimša created a plaster relief in 1905.[201] In 1910, Daukantas' relatives transferred his manuscripts and library to the Lithuanian Scientific Society which promoted further study of his life and work.[200] Historian Augustinas Janulaitis published an extensive biography of Daukantas in 1913 and his surviving correspondence in 1922.[107] Daukantas works were added to the Lithuanian school curriculum of Lithuanian literature. In 1924, Lithuanian teachers began raising funds for a monument to Daukantas. A bronze sculpture was designed by Vincas Grybas and erected in Papilė in 1930.[202]  Since that time, Daukantas life and works were subjects of numerous academic studies. Two volumes of his selected works were published in 1955 followed by reprints or first publications of his other works.[203] His biography was published as separate monographs by Vytautas Merkys (1972, second edition 1991) and Saulius Žukas (1988).[204]

In 1927, a bronze bust by sculptor Juozas Zikaras was erected in the garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum in Kaunas (the bust was destroyed by Soviet authorities and restored in 1988).[205] In 1983, Akmenė District Municipality turned the former clergy house in Papilė where Daukantas spent his last years into a memorial museum.[206] From 1993 to the introduction of the euro in 2015, Daukantas was featured on 100 litas banknotes. A monument by sculptor Regimantas Midvikis in his native Lenkimai was unveiled in 1993.[207] The Simonas Daukantas Award was established in 1989 for accomplishments in historical studies, literary work, or other cultural work. Awarded every two years, it is administered by the Skuodas District Municipality since 2003. Its past recipients included historians Vytautas Merkys, Alfredas Bumblauskas, Edvardas Gudavičius, linguist Giedrius Subačius.[207] His place in Lithuanian history is also commemorated by Daukantas Square, facing the Presidential Palace in Vilnius. Seimas (Lithuanian parliament) declared 2018 as the year of Daukantas.[70]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonas_Daukantas
Lithuanians in the United Kingdom,"Lithuanians in the United Kingdom (Lithuanian: Didžiosios Britanijos lietuviai) include individuals born in Lithuania who have migrated to the UK, among them Lithuanian citizens of Russian descent and Polish Lithuanian citizens, as well as their British-born descendants. The 2011 UK Census recorded 95,730 Lithuanian-born residents in England, 1,353 in Wales,[5] 4,287 in Scotland,[6] and 7,341 in Northern Ireland.[7] The previous, 2001 UK Census, had recorded 4,363 Lithuanian-born residents.[8] The Office for National Statistics estimates that 144,000 Lithuanian-born immigrants were resident in the UK in 2013.[9]

Significant numbers of Lithuanians have come to the UK since Lithuania's European Union accession in 2004;[10] however, there have been historically notable Lithuanian communities in the UK since the early 20th century — most notably in Scotland (Glasgow and the mining communities of North Lanarkshire and Midlothian)[11] and London.[12][13] In Scotland, the first Lithuanians came during the latter part of the 19th century.[14] Between 1886 and 1914, around one in four Lithuanians emigrated from Lithuania, with most of those leaving doing so in the 1890s and 1900s.[12] Some of these emigrants were avoiding conscription into the Russian military, some were Lithuanian freedom fighters, others were Jews escaping persecution, and some were fleeing poverty.[15][16] The Lithuanian population of Scotland is estimated to have grown from a few hundred to 7,000. An estimated 2,000 Lithuanians settled elsewhere in Britain during this period. Around 15,000 Lithuanians also resided in Scotland temporarily, before migrating onwards to other countries; most notably the United States.[12] According to the BBC, some travelled to Scotland because they could not afford travel to the US, whereas others were duped, thinking that they had actually arrived in the United States.[15]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanians_in_the_United_Kingdom
Third Partition of Poland,"The Third Partition of Poland (1795) was the last in a series of the Partitions of Poland–Lithuania and the land of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth among Prussia, the Habsburg monarchy, and the Russian Empire which effectively ended Polish–Lithuanian national sovereignty until 1918. The partition was the result of the Kościuszko Uprising and was followed by a number of Polish–Lithuanian uprisings during the period.[1]

Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, in an attempt to strengthen the significantly weakened Commonwealth, King Stanisław August Poniatowski put into effect a series of reforms to enhance Poland's military, political system, economy, and society. These reforms reached their climax with the enactment of the May Constitution in 1791, which established a constitutional monarchy with separation into three branches of government, strengthened the bourgeoisie and abolished many of the nobility's privileges as well as many of the old laws of serfdom. In addition, to strengthen Poland's international standings, King Stanislaus signed the Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790. Angered by what was seen as dangerous, Jacobin-style reforms, Russia invaded Poland in 1792, beginning the War in Defense of the Constitution. Abandoned by her Prussian allies and betrayed by Polish nobles who desired to restore the privileges they had lost under the May Constitution, Poland was forced to sign the Second Partition in 1793, which ceded Dobrzyn, Kujavia, and a large portion of Greater Poland to Prussia and all of Poland's eastern provinces from Moldavia to Livonia to Russia, reducing Poland to one-third of her original size before the First Partition.[citation needed]

Outraged with the further humiliation of Poland by her neighbors and the betrayal by the Polish nobility, and emboldened by the French Revolution unfolding in France, the Polish masses quickly turned against the occupying forces of Prussia and Russia. Following a series of nationwide riots, on 24 March 1794, Polish patriot Tadeusz Kościuszko took command of the Polish armed forces and declared a nationwide uprising against Poland's foreign occupiers, marking the beginning of the Kościuszko Uprising. Catherine II and Frederick William II were quick to respond and, despite initial successes by Kosciuszko's forces, the uprising was crushed by November 1794. According to legend, when Kosciuszko fell off of his horse at the Battle of Maciejowice, shortly before he was captured, he said ""Finis Poloniae"", meaning in Latin ""[This is] the end of Poland.""[citation needed]

Austrian, Prussian, and Russian representatives met on 24 October 1795 to dissolve the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, with the three conquering powers signing a treaty to divide the region on 26 January 1797. This gave the Habsburg monarchy control of the Western Galicia and Southern Mazovia territories, with approximately 1.2 million people; Prussia received Podlachia, the remainder of Masovia, and Warsaw, with 1 million people; and Russia received the remaining land, including Vilnius and 1.2 million people. Unlike previous partitions, no Polish representative was party to the treaty. The Habsburgs, Russia, and Prussia forced King Stanislaus to abdicate and retire to St. Petersburg, where he died as a trophy prisoner in 1798. The victors also agreed to erase the country's name:

In view of the necessity to abolish everything which could revive the memory of the existence of the Kingdom of Poland, now that the annulment of this body politic has been effected ... the high contracting parties are agreed and undertake never to include in their titles ... the name or designation of the Kingdom of Poland, which shall remain suppressed as from the present and forever ...[2][page needed]

The Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ended the existence of an independent Polish and Lithuanian state for the next 123 years.[3] Immediately following the Third Partition, the occupying powers forced many Polish politicians, intellectuals, and revolutionaries to emigrate across Europe, in what was later known as the Great Emigration. These Polish nationalists participated in uprisings against Austria, Prussia, and Russia in former Polish lands, and many would serve France as part of the Polish Legions. In addition, Polish poets and artists would make the desire for national freedom a defining characteristic of the Polish Romanticist movement. Poland briefly regained semi-autonomy in 1807 when Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw, but this effectively ended with the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Congress created the Kingdom of Poland, sometimes called Congress Poland, as a Russian puppet state. Even this, however, came to an end after a Polish insurrection in 1831, at which point Russia ended most of the kingdom's autonomy and exacted multiple punitive measures on the Polish populace. In 1867, Russia made Poland an official part of the Russian Empire, as opposed to a puppet state. Poland would not regain full independence until the end of World War I when the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire allowed for the resurrection of Polish national sovereignty.[citation needed]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Partition_of_Poland

Königsberg,"Königsberg (/ˈkɜːnɪɡzbɜːrɡ/; German: [ˈkøːnɪçsbɛʁk] ⓘ or [ˈkøːnɪksbɛʁk] ⓘ; lit. 'King's mountain'; Polish: Królewiec; Lithuanian: Karaliaučius; Baltic Prussian: Kunnegsgarbs; Russian: Кёнигсберг, romanized: Kyónigsberg, IPA: [ˈkʲɵnʲɪɡzbʲɪrk]) is the historic German and Prussian name of the city now called Kaliningrad, Russia. The city was founded in 1255 on the site of the small Old Prussian settlement Twangste[3] by the Teutonic Knights during the Baltic Crusades. It was named in honour of King Ottokar II of Bohemia, who led a campaign against the pagan Old Prussians, a Baltic tribe.[4]

A Baltic port city, it successively became the capital of the State of the Teutonic Order, the Duchy of Prussia and the provinces of East Prussia and Prussia. Königsberg remained the coronation city of the Prussian monarchy from 1701 onwards, though the capital was Berlin. From the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries on, the inhabitants spoke predominantly German, although the city also had a profound influence upon the Lithuanian and Polish cultures. It was a publishing center of Lutheran literature; this included the first Polish translation of the New Testament, printed in the city in 1551, as well as the first book in Lithuanian and the first Lutheran catechism, both printed in Königsberg in 1547.

A university city, home of the Albertina University (founded in 1544), Königsberg developed into an important German intellectual and cultural center, being the residence of Simon Dach, Immanuel Kant, Käthe Kollwitz, E. T. A. Hoffmann, David Hilbert, Agnes Miegel, Hannah Arendt, Michael Wieck, and others. It was the easternmost large city in Germany until World War II. Between the wars, it was in the exclave of East Prussia, separated from Germany by the Polish Corridor.

The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in 1944 and during the Battle of Königsberg in 1945, when it was occupied by the Red Army. The Potsdam Agreement of 1945 placed it provisionally under Soviet administration, and it was annexed by the Soviet Union on 9 April 1945. Its small Lithuanian population was allowed to remain, but the Germans were expelled. The city was largely repopulated with Russians and, to a lesser degree, Ukrainians and Belarusians from the Soviet Union after the ethnic cleansing. It was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946, in honour of Soviet Communist functionary Mikhail Kalinin. The city's historic centre was subsequently demolished by the Soviet government.[1][2][5][6][7]

It is now the capital of Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast, an exclave bordered in the north by Lithuania and in the south by Poland. In the Final Settlement treaty of 1990, Germany renounced all claims to the city.

The first mention of the present-day location in chronicles indicates it as the place of a village of fishermen and hunters. When the Teutonic Order began the Northern Crusades, they built a wooden fortress, and later a stone fortress, calling it ""Conigsberg"", which later morphed into ""Königsberg"". The literal meaning of this is 'King's mountain', in apparent honour of King Ottokar II of Bohemia,[4] who led one of the Teutonic campaigns.

In Polish, it is called Królewiec, in Lithuanian Karaliaučius (calques of the original German name).[8]

Königsberg was preceded by a Sambian — or Old Prussian — fort known as Twangste (Prussian word tvinksta means a pond made by a dam),[9] as well as several Old Prussian settlements including the fishing village and port Lipnick and the farming villages Sakkeim and Trakkeim.

During the conquest of the Prussian Sambians by the Teutonic Knights in 1255, Twangste was destroyed and replaced with a new fortress known as Conigsberg. This name meant ""King's Hill"" (Latin: castrum Koningsberg, Mons Regius, Regiomontium), honoring King Ottokar II of Bohemia who paid for the erection of the first fortress there during the Prussian Crusade.[10][11] Northwest of this new Königsberg Castle arose an initial settlement, later known as Steindamm, roughly 7 kilometres (4 mi) from the Vistula Lagoon.[12]

The Teutonic Order used Königsberg to fortify their conquests in Samland and as a base for campaigns against pagan Lithuania. Under siege during the Prussian uprisings in 1262–63, Königsberg Castle was relieved by the Master of the Livonian Order.[13][14] Because the initial northwestern settlement was destroyed by the Prussians during the rebellion, rebuilding occurred in the southern valley between the castle hill and the Pregolya River. This new settlement, Altstadt, received Culm rights in 1286. Löbenicht, a new town directly east of Altstadt between the Pregolya River and the Schlossteich, received its own rights in 1300. Medieval Königsberg's third town was Kneiphof, which received town rights in 1327 and was located on an island of the same name in the Pregolya, south of Altstadt.

Within the state of the Teutonic Order, Königsberg was the residence of the marshal, one of the chief administrators of the military order.[15] The city was also the seat of the Bishopric of Samland, one of the four dioceses into which Prussia had been divided in 1243 by the papal legate, William of Modena. Adalbert of Prague became the main patron saint of Königsberg Cathedral, a landmark of the town of Kneiphof.

Königsberg joined the Hanseatic League in 1340 and developed into an important port for the south-eastern Baltic region, trading goods throughout Prussia, the Kingdom of Poland, and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The chronicler Peter of Dusburg probably wrote his Chronicon terrae Prussiae in Königsberg from 1324 to 1330.[16] After the Teutonic Order's victory over pagan Lithuanians in the 1348 Battle of Strėva, Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode established a Cistercian nunnery in the city.[17] Aspiring students were educated in Königsberg before continuing on to higher education elsewhere, such as Prague or Leipzig.[16]

Although the Knights suffered a crippling defeat in the Battle of Grunwald, Königsberg remained under the control of the Teutonic Knights throughout the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War. Livonian knights replaced the Prussian branch's garrison at Königsberg, allowing them to participate in the recovery of towns occupied by Władysław II Jagiełło's troops.[18]

In 1440, Königsberg became a founding member of the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation. In 1454 the Confederation rebelled against the Teutonic Knights and asked the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland; the king agreed, and signed an act of incorporation.[19] The local mayor pledged allegiance to the Polish king during the incorporation in March 1454.[20] This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War (1454–1466) between the State of the Teutonic Order and the Kingdom of Poland. The city, known in Polish as Królewiec, became the seat of the short-lived Królewiec Voivodeship.[21] King Casimir IV authorized the city to mint Polish coins.[22] While Königsberg three towns initially joined the rebellion, Altstadt and Löbenicht soon rejoined the Teutonic Knights and defeated Kneiphof (Knipawa) in 1455. Grand Master Ludwig von Erlichshausen fled from the crusaders' capital at Castle Marienburg (Malbork) to Königsberg in 1457; the city's magistrate presented Erlichshausen with a barrel of beer out of compassion.[23] In 1465, a landing force from Polish-allied Elbląg destroyed the shipyard near Altstadt, preventing the Teutonic Knights from rebuilding their fleet until the end of the war.[24]

Following the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) — which ended the Thirteen Years' War — the reduced monastic state became a fief of the Kingdom of Poland, and Königsberg became the new capital.[25][26] The grand masters took over the marshal's quarters. During the Polish-Teutonic War (1519–1521), Königsberg was besieged without success[27] by Polish forces led by Grand Crown Hetman Mikołaj Firlej. The city itself opposed the Teutonic Knights' war against Poland and demanded peace.

Through the preachings of the Bishop of Samland, Georg von Polenz, Königsberg became predominantly Lutheran during the Protestant Reformation.[28] After summoning a quorum of the Knights to Königsberg, Grand Master Albert of Brandenburg (a member of the House of Hohenzollern) secularised the Teutonic Knights' remaining territories in Prussia in 1525 and converted to Lutheranism.[29] By paying feudal homage to his uncle, King Sigismund I of Poland, Albert became the first duke of the new Duchy of Prussia, a fief of Poland.[21]

While the Prussian estates quickly allied with the duke, the Prussian peasantry would only swear allegiance to Albert in person at Königsberg, seeking the duke's support against the oppressive nobility.[citation needed][clarification needed] After convincing the rebels to lay down their arms, Albert had several of their leaders executed.[30]

Königsberg, the capital, became one of the biggest cities and ports of Ducal Prussia, having considerable autonomy, a separate parliament and currency. While German continued to be the official language, the city served as a vibrant center of publishing in both Polish and Lithuanian.[citation needed] The city flourished through the export of wheat, timber, hemp, and furs,[31] as well as pitch, tar, and fly ash.[32] The city acted as an intermediary in maritime trade between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Netherlands, England and France.[33] Many Poles, including noblemen and Polish Jews, came to the city for trade.[33] The 17th-century stock exchange included a painting depicting a townswoman buying goods from a Pole and a Dutchman, embracing the notion that the city's prosperity was based on trade with the East and West, particularly Poland and the Netherlands.[33]

Königsberg was one of the few Baltic ports regularly visited by more than one hundred ships annually in the latter 16th century, along with Gdańsk and Riga.[34] The University of Königsberg, founded by Duke Albert in 1544 and receiving token royal approval from King Sigismund II Augustus in 1560,[21] became a center of Protestant teaching. The university had a profound impact on the development of Lithuanian culture, and several important Lithuanian writers attended the Albertina (see Lithuanians section below). Poles, including several notable figures, were also among the staff and students of the university (see Poles section below). The university was also the preferred educational institution of the Baltic German nobility.

With the growth of the Scottish diaspora in Poland, the first acquisition of citizenship in the city by a Scotsman occurred in 1561.[35]

On several occasions the city got into disputes with the Prussian Dukes and sought intervention and confirmation of its rights from the Polish authorities. In 1566, the city's rights were extended and the Prussian dukes were not allowed to interfere in the city's internal affairs by the Polish Royal Commissioners.[36] In 1635, Polish King Władysław IV Vasa granted the city the right to organize its military defense against a possible Swedish attack in exchange for exemption from paying taxes to Prussian dukes.[37] King Władysław IV was hosted in the city very grandly during his visits in 1635 and 1636.[38] He appointed Jerzy Ossoliński as the Polish governor of the duchy in 1636. Ossoliński resided in the city and completed the fortification of the city against a potential Swedish attack.[38]

The capable Duke Albert was succeeded by his feeble-minded son, Albert Frederick. Anna, daughter of Albert Frederick, married Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg, who was granted the right of succession to Prussia on Albert Frederick's death in 1618. From this time the Electors of Brandenburg, the rulers of Brandenburg-Prussia, governed the Duchy of Prussia.[citation needed]

When Imperial and then Swedish armies overran Brandenburg during the Thirty Years' War of 1618–1648, the Hohenzollern court fled to Königsberg. On 1 November 1641, Elector Frederick William persuaded the Prussian diet to accept an excise tax.[39] In the Treaty of Königsberg of January 1656, the elector recognised his Duchy of Prussia as a fief of Sweden. In the Treaty of Wehlau in 1657, however, he negotiated the release of Prussia from Polish sovereignty in return for an alliance with Poland. The 1660 Treaty of Oliva confirmed Prussian independence from both Poland and Sweden.

In 1661 Frederick William informed the Prussian diet that he possessed jus supremi et absoluti domini, and that the Prussian Landtag could convene with his permission.[40] The Königsberg burghers, led by Hieronymus Roth of Kneiphof, opposed ""the Great Elector's"" absolutist claims, and actively rejected the Treaties of Wehlau and Oliva, seeing Prussia as ""indisputably contained within the territory of the Polish Crown"".[41] Delegations from the city's burghers went to the Polish king, John II Casimir Vasa, who initially promised aid, but then failed to follow through.[41] The town's residents attacked the elector's troops while local Lutheran priests held masses for the Polish king and for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[41] However, Frederick William succeeded in imposing his authority after arriving with 3,000 troops in October 1662 and training his artillery on the town.[41] Refusing to request mercy, Roth went to prison in Peitz until his death in 1678.[40]

The Prussian estates which swore fealty to Frederick William in Königsberg on 18 October 1663[42] refused the elector's requests for military funding, and Colonel Christian Ludwig von Kalckstein sought assistance from neighbouring Poland. After the elector's agents had abducted Kalckstein, he was executed in 1672. The Prussian estates' submission to Frederick William followed; in 1673 and 1674 the elector received taxes not granted by the estates and Königsberg received a garrison without the estates' consent.[43] The economic and political weakening of Königsberg strengthened the power of the Junker nobility within Prussia.[44]

Königsberg long remained a center of Lutheran resistance to Calvinism within Brandenburg-Prussia; Frederick William forced the city to accept Calvinist citizens and property-holders in 1668.[45]

By the act of coronation in Königsberg Castle on 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, became Frederick I, King in Prussia. The elevation of the Duchy of Prussia to the Kingdom of Prussia was possible because the Hohenzollerns' authority in Prussia was independent of Poland and the Holy Roman Empire. Since ""Kingdom of Prussia"" was increasingly used to designate all of the Hohenzollern lands, former ducal Prussia became known as the Province of Prussia (1701–1773), with Königsberg as its capital. However, Berlin and Potsdam in Brandenburg were the main residences of the Prussian kings.

The city was wracked by plague and other illnesses from September 1709 to April 1710, losing 9,368 people, or roughly a quarter of its populace.[46] On 13 June 1724, Altstadt, Kneiphof, and Löbenicht amalgamated to formally create the larger city Königsberg. Suburbs that subsequently were annexed to Königsberg include Sackheim, Rossgarten, and Tragheim.[12]

From 1734, during the War of the Polish Succession, Polish King Stanisław Leszczyński stayed in the city, and several prominent Polish officials, including Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński, and voivodes Antoni Michał Potocki, Piotr Jan Czapski and Andrzej Morsztyn, formed an informal political committee in support of Leszczyński there in 1734.[47] After the arrival of more Leszczyński's supporters in 1735, the city was the main center of authority and court of King Stanisław Leszczyński.[48] After his defeat in the war, Leszczyński signed an act of renunciation of the Polish crown in the city on 26 January 1736, and then left the city for France on 27 March 1736.[49]

During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the Russian Empire decided to go to war with the Kingdom of Prussia and annex the territory and city, which was then to be offered to Poland as part of a territorial exchange desired by Russia.[50] Russia occupied and annexed Königsberg in January 1758 with no resistance, and the Prussian estates pledged allegiance to Russia.[51] The economic growth of the following years was based on the supply of arms to the Russian army and boosted trade with the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[52] By the terms of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (signed 5 May 1762), Russia relinquished its claim to Königsberg and it reverted back to Prussian control.[41][53]

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Königsberg became the capital of the newly formed province of East Prussia in 1773, which replaced the Province of Prussia in 1773. By 1800 the city was approximately five miles (8.0 km) in circumference and had 60,000 inhabitants, including a military garrison of 7,000, making it one of the most populous German cities of the time.[54]

After Prussia's defeat at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 during the War of the Fourth Coalition and the subsequent occupation of Berlin, King Frederick William III of Prussia fled with his court from Berlin to Königsberg.[55] The city was a centre for political resistance to Napoleon. To foster liberalism and nationalism among the Prussian middle class, the ""League of Virtue"" was founded in Königsberg in April 1808. The French forced its dissolution in December 1809, but its ideals were continued by the Turnbewegung of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in Berlin.[56] Königsberg officials, such as Johann Gottfried Frey, formulated much of Stein's 1808 Städteordnung, or new order for urban communities, which emphasised self-administration for Prussian towns.[57] The East Prussian Landwehr was organised from the city after the Convention of Tauroggen.[58]

In 1819 Königsberg had a population of 63,800.[59] It served as the capital of the united Province of Prussia from 1824 to 1878, when East Prussia was merged with West Prussia. It was also the seat of the Regierungsbezirk Königsberg, an administrative subdivision.[60]

Led by the provincial president Theodor von Schön and the Königsberger Volkszeitung newspaper, Königsberg was a stronghold of liberalism against the conservative government of King Frederick William IV.[61] During the revolution of 1848, there were 21 episodes of public unrest in the city;[62] major demonstrations were suppressed.[63] Königsberg became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. A sophisticated-for-its-time series of fortifications around the city that included fifteen forts was completed in 1888.[64]

The extensive Prussian Eastern Railway linked the city to Breslau (Wrocław), Thorn (Toruń), Insterburg, Eydtkuhnen, Tilsit, and Pillau. In 1860 the railway connecting Berlin with St. Petersburg was completed and increased Königsberg's commerce. Extensive electric tramways were in operation by 1900; and regular steamers plied the waterways to Memel, Tapiau and Labiau, Cranz, Tilsit, and Danzig (Gdańsk). The completion of a canal to Pillau in 1901 increased the trade of Russian grain in Königsberg, but, like much of eastern Germany, the city's economy was generally in decline.[65] The city was an important entrepôt for Scottish herring. in 1904 the export peaked at more than 322 thousand barrels.[66] By 1900 the city's population had grown to 188,000, with a 9,000-strong military garrison.[12] By 1914 Königsberg had a population of 246,000;[67] Jews flourished in the culturally pluralistic city.[68]

Following the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, Imperial Germany was replaced with the democratic Weimar Republic. The Kingdom of Prussia ended with the abdication of the Hohenzollern monarch, Wilhelm II, and the kingdom was succeeded by the Free State of Prussia. Königsberg and East Prussia, however, were separated from the rest of Weimar Germany following the restoration of independent Poland and the creation of the Polish Corridor. Due to the isolated geographical situation after World War I the German Government supported several large infrastructure projects: 1919 Airport ""Devenau"" (the first civil airport in Germany), 1920 ""Deutsche Ostmesse"" (a new German trade fair; including new hotels and radio station), 1929 reconstruction of the railway system including the new central railway station and 1930 opening of the North station.

In 1932 the local paramilitary SA had already started to terrorise their political opponents. On the night of 31 July 1932 there was a bomb attack on the headquarters of the Social Democrats in Königsberg, the Otto-Braun-House. The Communist politician Gustav Sauf was killed, and the executive editor of the Social Democrat ""Königsberger Volkszeitung"", Otto Wyrgatsch, and the German People's Party politician Max von Bahrfeldt were severely injured. Members of the Reichsbanner were attacked and the local Reichsbanner Chairman of Lötzen (Giżycko), Kurt Kotzan, was murdered on 6 August 1932.[69][70]

Following Adolf Hitler's coming to power, Nazis confiscated Jewish shops and, as in the rest of Germany, a public book burning was organised, accompanied by antisemitic speeches in May 1933 at the Trommelplatz square. Street names and monuments of Jewish origin were removed, and signs such as ""Jews are not welcomed in hotels"" started appearing. As part of the state-wide ""aryanisation"" of the civil service Jewish academics were ejected from the university.[71]

In July 1934, Hitler made a speech in the city in front of 25,000 supporters.[72] In 1933 the NSDAP alone received 54% of votes in the city.[72] After the Nazis took power in Germany, opposition politicians were persecuted and newspapers were banned. The Otto-Braun-House was requisitioned and became the headquarters of the SA, which used the house to imprison and torture opponents. Walter Schütz, a communist member of the Reichstag, was murdered there.[73] Many who would not co-operate with the rulers of Nazi Germany were sent to concentration camps and held prisoner there until their death or liberation.

In 1935, the Wehrmacht designated Königsberg as the Headquarters for Wehrkreis I (under the command of General der Artillerie Albert Wodrig), which took in all of East Prussia.[citation needed] According to the census of May 1939, Königsberg had a population of 372,164.[74]

In World War II both Königsberg and Berlin had large Fernschreibstellen (teleprinter offices) for the German Army which collected morning messages each day from regional or local centres to be sent in long messages to headquarters. They also had a Geheimschreibstube or cipher room where plaintext messages could be encrypted on Lorenz SZ40/42 machines. If sent by radio rather than landline they were intercepted and decrypted at Bletchley Park in England, where they were known as Fish. Some messages were daily returns, and some were between Hitler and his generals; both were valuable to Allied intelligence. Königsberg had links over the Eastern Front.[75]

Prior to the Nazi era, Königsberg was home to a third of East Prussia's 13,000 Jews. Under Nazi rule, the Polish and Jewish minorities were classified as Untermenschen and persecuted by the authorities. The city's Jewish population shrank from 3,200 in 1933 to 2,100 in October 1938. The New Synagogue of Königsberg, constructed in 1896, was destroyed during Kristallnacht (9 November 1938); 500 Jews soon fled the city.

After the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942, Königsberg's Jews began to be deported to various Nazi concentration camps:[76] The SS sent the first and largest group of Jewish deportees, comprising 465 Jewish men, women and children, from Königsberg and East Prussia to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp near Minsk on 24 June 1942. Almost all were murdered soon after their arrival. Additional transports from Königsberg to the Theresienstadt ghetto and Auschwitz took place until 1945.[77]

In 1944–1945, the Germans operated a sub-camp of the Stutthof concentration camp in Königsberg, where they imprisoned around 500 Jews as forced labour.[78] In 1939, the Germans also established a forced labour camp for Romani people in the city.[79]

In September 1939, with the German invasion of Poland underway, the Polish consulate in Königsberg was attacked (which constituted a violation of international law), its workers arrested and sent to concentration camps where several of them died.[80] Polish students at the local university were captured, tortured and finally executed.[80] Other victims included local Polish civilians guillotined for petty violations of German law and regulations such as buying and selling meat.[80] Nevertheless, the Polish resistance movement was active in the city, which served as one of the region's main transfer points for smuggled Polish underground press.[81]

In September 1944 69,000 slave labourers were registered in the city (not counting prisoners of war), with most of them working on the outskirts; within the city were 15,000 slave labourers.[82] All of them were denied freedom of movement, forced to wear a ""P"" sign, if Poles, or ""Ost"" sign, if they were from the Soviet Union, and were watched by special units of the Gestapo and Wehrmacht.[82] They were denied basic spiritual and physical needs and food, and suffered from famine and exhaustion.[82] The conditions of the forced labour were described as ""tragic"", especially for Poles and Soviets, who were treated harshly by their German overseers. Ordered to paint German ships with toxic paints and chemicals, they were neither given gas-masks nor was there any ventilation in facilities where they worked, supposedly to expedite construction, while the substances evaporated in temperatures as high as 40 Celsius. As a result, there were cases of sudden illness or death during the work.[82]

In 1944, Königsberg suffered heavy damage from British bombing attacks and burned for several days. The historic city center, especially the original quarters Altstadt, Löbenicht, and Kneiphof were destroyed, including the cathedral, the castle, all churches of the old city, the old and the new universities, and the old shipping quarters.[83]

Many people fled from Königsberg ahead of the Red Army's advance after October 1944, particularly after word spread of the Soviet atrocities at Nemmersdorf.[84][85] In early 1945, Soviet forces, under the command of the Polish-born Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, besieged the city that Hitler had envisaged as the home for a museum holding all the Germans had 'found in Russia'.[86] In Operation Samland, General Baghramyan's 1st Baltic Front, now known as the Samland Group, captured Königsberg in April.[87] Although Hitler had declared Königsberg an ""invincible bastion of German spirit"", the Soviets captured the city after a three-month-long siege. A temporary German breakout had allowed some of the remaining civilians to escape via train and naval evacuation from the nearby port of Pillau. Königsberg, which had been declared a ""fortress"" (Festung) by the Germans, was fanatically defended.[88]

On 21 January, during the Red Army's East Prussian Offensive, mostly Polish and Hungarian Jews from Seerappen, Jesau, Heiligenbeil, Schippenbeil, and Gerdauen (subcamps of Stutthof concentration camp) were gathered in Königsberg by the Nazis. Up to 7,000 of them were forced on a death march to Sambia: those that survived were subsequently executed at Palmnicken.[76]

On 9 April – one month before the end of the war in Europe – the German military commander of Königsberg, General Otto Lasch, surrendered the remnants of his forces, following the three-month-long siege by the Red Army. For this act, Lasch was condemned to death, in absentia, by Hitler.[89] At the time of the surrender, military and civilian dead in the city were estimated at 42,000, with the Red Army claiming over 90,000 prisoners.[90] Lasch's subterranean command bunker is preserved as a museum in today's Kaliningrad.[91]

About 120,000 survivors remained in the ruins of the devastated city. The German civilians were held as forced labourers until 1946. Only the Lithuanians, a small minority of the pre-war population, were collectively allowed to stay.[92] Between October 1947 and October 1948, about 100,000 Germans were forcibly moved to Germany.[93][need quotation to verify] The remaining 20,000 German residents were expelled in 1949–50.[94]

According to Soviet documents, there were 140,114 German inhabitants in September 1945 in the region that later became the Kaliningrad Oblast, thereof 68,014 in Königsberg. Between April 1947 and May 1951, according to Soviet documents, 102,407 were deported to the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. How many of the deportees were from the city of Königsberg does not become apparent from Soviet records. It is estimated that 43,617 Germans were in the city in the spring of 1946.[95] According to German historian Andreas Kossert, there were about 100,000 to 126,000 German civilians in the city at the time of Soviet conquest, and of these only 24,000 survived to be deported in 1947.  Hunger accounted for 75% of the deaths, epidemics (especially typhoid fever) for 2.6% and violence for 15%, according to Kossert.[96]

Under the Potsdam Agreement of 1 August 1945, the city became part of the Soviet Union pending the final determination of territorial borders at an anticipated peace settlement. This final determination eventually took place on 12 September 1990 when the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed. The excerpt from the initial agreement pertaining to the partition of East Prussia, including the area surrounding Königsberg, is as follows (note that Königsberg is spelt ""Koenigsberg"" in the original document):

VI. CITY OF KOENIGSBERG AND THE ADJACENT AREAThe Conference examined a proposal by the Soviet Government that pending the final determination of territorial questions at the peace settlement, the section of the western frontier of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which is adjacent to the Baltic Sea should pass from a point on the eastern shore of the Bay of Danzig to the east, north of Braunsberg – Goldep, to the meeting point of the frontiers of Lithuania, the Polish Republic and East Prussia.

The Conference has agreed in principle to the proposal of the Soviet Government concerning the ultimate transfer to the Soviet Union of the city of Koenigsberg and the area adjacent to it as described above, subject to expert examination of the actual frontier.

The President of the United States and the British Prime Minister supported the proposal of the Conference at the forthcoming peace settlement.[97]

Königsberg was renamed Kaliningrad in 1946 after the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Mikhail Kalinin, although Kalinin was unrelated to the city, and there were already cities named in honour of Kalinin in the Soviet Union, namely Kalinin (now Tver) and Kaliningrad (now Korolev, Moscow Oblast).[98][99]

Some historians speculate that it may have originally been offered to the Lithuanian SSR because the resolution from the conference specifies that Kaliningrad's border would be at the (pre-war) Lithuanian frontier. The remaining German population was forcibly expelled between 1947 and 1948. The annexed territory was populated with Soviet citizens, mostly ethnic Russians but to a lesser extent also Ukrainians and Belarusians.[100]

The German language was replaced with the Russian language. In 1950, there were 1,165,000 inhabitants, which was only half the number of the pre-war population.

From 1953 to 1962, a monument to Stalin stood on Victory Square. In 1973, the town hall was turned into the House of Soviets. In 1975, the trolleybus was launched again. In 1980, a concert hall was opened in the building of the former Lutheran Church of the Holy Family. In 1986, the Kreuzkirche building was transferred to the Russian Orthodox Church.

For foreigners, the city was completely closed and, with the exception of rare visits of friendship from neighboring Poland, it was practically not visited by foreigners.[101][102]

The old city was not restored, and the ruins of the Königsberg Castle were demolished in the late 1960s,[1] on Leonid Brezhnev's personal orders,[1][2] despite the protests of architects, historians, local historians and ordinary residents of the city.[5][6][7]

The ""reconstruction"" of the oblast, threatened by hunger in the immediate post-war years, was carried out through an ambitious policy of oceanic fishing[103] with the creation of one of the main fishing harbours of the USSR in Kaliningrad city. Fishing not only fed the regional economy but also was a basis for social and scientific development, in particular oceanography.[104]

In 1957, an agreement was signed and later came into force which delimited the border between Polish People's Republic (Soviet satellite state at the time) and the Soviet Union.[105][106]

The region was added as a semi-exclave to the Russian SFSR; since 1946 it has been known as the Kaliningrad Oblast. According to some historians, Stalin created it as an oblast separate from the Lithuanian SSR because it further separated the Baltic states from the West.[107] Others think that the reason was that the region was far too strategic for the USSR to leave it in the hands of another SSR other than the Russian one.[104] The names of the cities, towns, rivers, and other geographical features were changed to Russian names.

The area was administered by the planning committee of the Lithuanian SSR, although it had its own Communist Party committee.[citation needed] In the 1950s, Nikita Khrushchev offered the entire Kaliningrad Oblast to the Lithuanian SSR but Antanas Sniečkus refused to accept the territory because it would add at least a million ethnic Russians to Lithuania proper.[100][108]

In 2010, the German magazine Der Spiegel published a report claiming that Kaliningrad had been offered to Germany in 1990 (against payment). The offer was not seriously considered by the West German government which, at the time, saw reunification with East Germany as a higher priority.[109] However, this story was later denied by Mikhail Gorbachev.[110]

Following the Christianization of the region, the vast majority of the population was Catholic, and after the Reformation, the majority of the population belonged to the Evangelical Church of Prussia. A majority of its parishioners were Lutherans, although there were also Calvinists.

The Jewish community in the city had its origins in the 16th century, with the arrival of the first Jews in 1538. The first synagogue was built in 1756. A second, smaller synagogue which served Orthodox Jews was constructed later, eventually becoming the New Synagogue.

The Jewish population of Königsberg in the 18th century was fairly low, although this changed as restrictions[114] became relaxed over the course of the 19th century. In 1756 there were 29 families of ""protected Jews"" in Königsberg, which increased to 57 by 1789. The total number of Jewish inhabitants was less than 500 in the middle of the 18th century, and around 800 by the end of it, out of a total population of almost 60,000 people.[115]

The number of Jewish inhabitants peaked in 1880 at about 5,000, many of whom were migrants escaping pogroms in the Russian Empire. This number declined subsequently so that by 1933, when the Nazis took over, the city had about 3,200 Jews. As a result of antisemitism and persecution in the 1920s and 1930s two-thirds of the city's Jews emigrated, mostly to the US and Great Britain. Those who remained were shipped by the Germans to concentration camps in two waves; first in 1938 to various camps in Germany, and the second in 1942 to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in occupied Czechoslovakia, Kaiserwald concentration camp in occupied Latvia, as well as camps in Minsk in the occupied Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[116]

The Lithuanian Duke Butautas was baptized in Königsberg in 1365.[117] In the 14th century Vytautas the Great was residing in Königsberg following his retreat from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and 31 Samogitian nobles visited him in 1390 to recognize him as their ruler and concluded a peace and trade treaty.[117]

The University of Königsberg was an important center of Protestant Lithuanian culture and studies.[118] Abraomas Kulvietis and Stanislovas Rapalionis are also seen as important early Lithuanian scholars, who also were one of the co-founders of the University of Königsberg.[118][117] Daniel Klein published the first Lithuanian grammar book in Königsberg in 1653. Königsberg was closely related to the Lithuanian culture, and had an important impact in founding the literary language and national press of Lithuania. Despite persecution and intensive Germanisation, about 9 percent of the city was Lithuanian by the end of the 19th century.[119] Quite many Lithuanian publications were published by Königsberg's printing presses.[117]

Poles were among the first professors of the University of Königsberg,[120] which received the royal Law of Privilege from King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland on 28 March 1560.[121] University of Königsberg lecturers included Hieronim Malecki (theology), Maciej Menius (astronomy) and Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (medicine).[122] Jan Kochanowski and Stanislaw Sarnicki were among the first students known to be Polish, later Florian Ceynowa, Wojciech Kętrzynski[123] and Julian Klaczko studied in Königsberg.[124] For 24 years Celestyn Myślenta (who first registered at the University as ""Polonus"") was a seven time rector of the university,[125] while Maciej Menius was a three times rector.[126] From 1728 there was a ""Polish Seminar"" at the seminary of Protestant theology, which operated until the early 1930s and had developed a number of pastors, including Krzysztof Celestyn Mrongovius and August Grzybowski.[122][127] Duke Albert of Prussia established a press in Königsberg that issued thousands of Polish pamphlets and religious books. During the Reformation Königsberg became a place of refuge for Polish Protestant adherents, a training ground for Polish Protestant clergy and a source of Polish Protestant literature.[128] In 1564 Jan Mączyński issued his Polish-Latin lexicon at Königsberg.[129]

According to historian Janusz Jasiński, based on estimates obtained from the records of St. Nicholas's Church, during the 1530s Lutheran Poles constituted about one quarter of the city population. This does not include Polish Catholics or Calvinists who did not have centralised places of worship until the 17th century, hence records that far back for these two groups are not available.[115]

From the 16th to 20th centuries, the city was a publishing center of Polish-language literature, especially religious literature. In 1545 in Königsberg a Polish catechism was printed by Jan Seklucjan.[130][131] In 1551 the first translation of the New Testament in Polish came out, issued by Stanisław Murzynowski.[130] Murzynowski's collections of sermons were delivered by Eustachy Trepka and in 1574 by Hieronim Malecki. The works of Mikolaj Rej were printed here by Seklucjan.[132] Maciej Stryjkowski announced in Königsberg the publication of his Kronika Polska, Litewska, Żmudzka, i wszystkiej Rusi (""A Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all Rus"").[133]

Although formally the relationship of these lands with Poland stopped at the end of the 17th century, in practice the Polish element in Königsberg played a significant role for the next century, until the outbreak of World War II. Before the second half of the 19th century many municipal institutions (e.g. courts, magistrates) employed Polish translators, and there was a course in Polish at the university.[134] Polish books were issued as well as magazines with the last one being the Kalendarz Staropruski Ewangelicki (Old Prussian Evangelical Calendar) issued between 1866 and 1931.[41] In the 1840s, a local branch of the Polish Democratic Society was founded.[135] The city played an important role in the January Uprising, as it was one of the main supply centres for Polish underground movement, with about 10 companies of Königsberg smuggling arms and ammunition for Polish insurgents. There was a complex Polish resistance network built in the city, including figures such as Kazimierz Szulc and Piotr Drzewiecki. In 1876, Wojciech Kętrzyński wrote that the city retained a significant Polish community and the local population had pro-Polish sentiments, writing: ""In Königsberg [...] a Pole among Germans today still finds sympathetic hearts, hearts that nourish sympathy for him"".[136] At that time, between 25 and 30 percent of the city's population was Polish.[136][137]

During the Protestant Reformation the oldest church in Königsberg, St. Nicholas, was opened for non-Germans, especially Lithuanians and Poles.[138] Services for Lithuanians started in 1523, and by the mid-16th century also included ones for Poles.[139] By 1603 it had become a solely Polish-language church as Lithuanian service was moved to St. Elizabeth. In 1880 St. Nicholas was converted to a German-language church; weekly Polish services remained only for Masurians in the Prussian Army, although those were halted in 1901.[140] The church was bombed in 1944, further damaged in 1945, and the remaining ruins were demolished after the war in 1950.[141] The Königsberg Cathedral also hosted Polish-language services until the 18th century.

Königsberg was the birthplace of the mathematician Christian Goldbach and the writer E.T.A. Hoffmann,[142] as well as the home of the philosopher Immanuel Kant,[143] who lived there virtually all his life and rarely travelled more than ten miles (16 km) away from the city.[144] Kant entered the university of Königsberg at age 16 and was appointed to a chair in metaphysics there in 1770 at the age of 46. While working there he published his Critique of Pure Reason (arguing that knowledge arises from the application of innate concepts to sensory experience) and his Metaphysics of Morals which argues that virtue is acquired by the performance of duty for its own sake.[145] In 1736, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler used the arrangement of the city's bridges and islands as the basis for the Seven Bridges of Königsberg Problem, which led to the mathematical branches of topology and graph theory. In 1862, David Hilbert was baptised in Königsberg and educated there;[146] he established himself as one of the world's most influential mathematicians by the turn of the century.[147] Noted South African baboon rescuer Rita Miljo (1931–2012) grew up in Königsberg.[148] The distinguished biochemist and Nobel prizewinner Fritz Lipmann (1899–1986) was born in Königsberg.

The language of government and high culture was German. The Low Prussian dialect was widely spoken, but is now a moribund language as its refugee speakers are elderly and dying out. As the capital of the region of East Prussia which was a multi-ethnic territory, diverse languages such as Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Yiddish were commonly heard on the streets of Königsberg. Old Prussian, a Baltic language, died out in the 18th century.

In the Königsstraße (King Street) stood the Academy of Art with a collection of over 400 paintings. About 50 works were by Italian masters; some early Dutch paintings were also to be found there.[149] At the King's Gate stood statues of King Ottakar I of Bohemia, Albert of Prussia, and Frederick I of Prussia. Königsberg had a magnificent Exchange (completed in 1875) with fine views of the harbour from the staircase. Along Bahnhofsstraße (""Station Street"") were the offices of the famous Royal Amber Works – Samland was celebrated as the ""Amber Coast"". There was also an observatory fitted up by the astronomer Friedrich Bessel, a botanical garden, and a zoological museum. The ""Physikalisch"", near the Heumarkt, contained botanical and anthropological collections and prehistoric antiquities. Two large theatres built during the Wilhelmine era were the Stadttheater (municipal theatre) and the Apollo.

Königsberg Castle was one of the city's most notable structures. The former seat of the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights and the Dukes of Prussia, it contained the Schloßkirche, or palace church, where Frederick I was crowned in 1701 and William I in 1861. It also contained the spacious Moscowiter-Saal, one of the largest halls in the German Reich, and a museum of Prussian history.

Königsberg became a center of education when the Albertina University was founded by Duke Albert of Prussia in 1544. The university was opposite the north and east side of the Königsberg Cathedral. Lithuanian scholar Stanislovas Rapalionis, one of the founding fathers of the university, was the first professor of theology.[150]

As a consequence of the Protestant Reformation, the 1525 and subsequent Prussian church orders called for providing religious literature in the languages spoken by the recipients.[151] Duke Albrecht thus called in a Danzig (Gdańsk) book printer, Hans Weinreich, who was soon joined by other book printers, to publish Lutheran literature not only in German and (New) Latin, but also in Latvian, Lithuanian, Old Prussian and Polish.[152] The expected readership were inhabitants of the duchy, religious refugees, Lutherans in Poland (including neighbouring Warmia) and Lithuania as well as Lutheran priests from Poland and Lithuania called in by the duke.[151] Königsberg thus became a centre for printing German, Polish and Lithuanian books:[153] In 1530, the first Polish translation of Luther's Small Catechism was published by Weinrich.[154] In 1545, Weinreich published two Old Prussian editions of the catechism, which are the oldest printed and second-oldest books in that language after the handwritten 14th-century ""Elbing dictionary"".[155] The first Lithuanian-language book, Simple Words of Catechism by Martynas Mažvydas, was also printed in Königsberg, published by Weinreich in 1547.[156] Further Polish- and Lithuanian-language religious and non-religious prints followed. One of the first newspapers in Polish was published in Königsberg in the years 1718–1720, the Poczta Królewiecka.[157] The city remained an important Polish printing center until the early 20th century, with the last Polish book printed in 1931.[158]

Football clubs which played in Königsberg included VfB Königsberg and SV Prussia-Samland Königsberg.  Lilli Henoch, the world record holder in the discus, shot put, and 4 × 100 meters relay events was born in Königsberg,[159] as was Eugen Sandow, dubbed the ""father of modern bodybuilding"". Segelclub RHE, Germany's oldest sailing club, was founded in Königsberg in 1855. The club still exists, and is now headquartered in Hamburg.

Königsberg was well known within Germany for its unique regional cuisine.[citation needed] A popular dish from the city was Königsberger Klopse, which is still made today in some specialist restaurants in the now Russian city and elsewhere in present-day Germany.

Other food and drink native to the city included:

The fortifications of Königsberg consist of numerous defensive walls, forts, bastions and other structures. They make up the First and the Second Defensive Belt, built in 1626–1634 and 1843–1859, respectively.[64] The 15-metre-thick First Belt was erected due to Königsberg's vulnerability during the Polish–Swedish wars.[64] The Second Belt was largely constructed on the place of the first one, which was in a bad condition.[64] The new belt included twelve bastions, three ravelins, seven spoil banks and two fortresses, surrounded by water moat.[64] Ten brick gates served as entrances and passages through defensive lines and were equipped with moveable bridges.[64]

There was a Bismarck tower just outside Königsberg, on the Galtgarben, the highest point on the Sambia Peninsula. It was built in 1906 and destroyed by German troops sometime in January 1945 as the Soviets approached.[161][162]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Königsberg
German occupation of the Baltic states during World War II,"After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Baltic states were under military occupation by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. Initially, many Estonians, Latvians, and Lithuanians considered the Germans liberators from the Soviet Union. The Balts hoped for the restoration of independence, but instead the Germans established a provisional government. During the occupation the Germans carried out discrimination, mass deportations and mass killings generating Baltic resistance movements.

The Germans agreed to leave the Baltic states, except for Lithuania (which was later ceded in exchange for oil-rich regions of Poland), under the Soviet sphere of influence in the 1939 German–Soviet Pact. The Germans lacked concern for the fate of the Baltic states, and initiated the evacuation of the Baltic Germans. Between October and December 1939 the Germans evacuated 13,700 people from Estonia and 52,583 from Latvia, and resettled them in Polish territories incorporated into Nazi Germany. The following summer [1940], the Soviets occupied and illegally annexed all three states. On 22 June 1941 the Germans carried out Operation Barbarossa. The Soviets had already implemented sovietization earlier, including the first mass deportation on 14 June, just eight days earlier, so the majority of Balts welcomed the German armed forces when they crossed the frontiers of Lithuania.[1]

In Lithuania, a revolt broke out on the first day of the war, and a provisional government was established. As the German armies approached Riga and Tallinn, there were attempts to re-establish national governments. It was hoped that the Germans would re-establish Baltic independence. Such political hopes soon evaporated and Baltic cooperation became less forthright or ceased altogether.[2] A growing proportion of the local populations turned against the Nazi regime as Germany turned the Baltic states—except for the Memel (Klaipėda) region annexed into Greater Germany in 1939—and most of Belarus into the Reichskommissariat Ostland, a colony in all but name in which the four predominant nationalities had little role in governance. Hinrich Lohse, a German Nazi politician, was Reichskommissar until he fled in the face of the Red Army's advance in 1944. Furthermore, Nazi Germany rejected the recreation of the Baltic states in any form in the future, as it unilaterally declared itself the legal successor to all three of the Baltic countries, as well as the Soviet Union, which it expected would collapse due to the German invasion.[3]

Germans immediately initiated anti-Jewish persecution by deploying its mobile death squads, the Einsatzgruppen. The remainder of the Baltic peoples were deemed by the Nazis to be ""a dying race"" that needed to be ""replaced by a more dynamic people"", meaning Germans.[4] The main Nazi plan for the colonization of conquered territories in the east, referred to as Generalplan Ost, called for the wholesale deportation of some two thirds of the native population from the territories of the Baltic states in the event of a German victory. The remaining third were either to be exterminated in situ, used as slave labour, or Germanized if deemed sufficiently ""Aryan"", while hundreds of thousands of German settlers were to be moved into the conquered territories. As Adolf Hitler explained in a conference on 16 July 1941, the Baltic states were to be annexed to Germany at the earliest possible moment,[5] and some Nazi ideologists suggested renaming Estonia as Peipusland and Latvia as Dünaland and integrating them as German provinces.[4] During the course of the war, the main thrust of Nazi racial policies was directed against the Jews, not so much the majority Baltic peoples.[6]

Towards the end of the war, once it became clear that Germany would be defeated, many Balts and Estonians joined the Germans once again. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war the Baltic countries would be able to attract Western support for the cause of independence from the USSR.[7] In Latvia an underground nationalist Central Council of Latvia was formed on 13 August 1943. An analogous body, the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania, emerged on 25 November 1943. On 23 March 1944, the underground National Committee of the Estonian Republic was founded.

After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July.

Although initially the Germans were perceived as liberators from the USSR and its repressions by most Estonians who hoped for the restoration of the country's independence, it was soon realized that they were merely another occupying power. Germans pillaged the country for the war effort and unleashed the Holocaust. Estonia was incorporated into the German province of Ostland. That made many Estonians unwilling to side with the Nazis to join the Finnish army to fight against the Soviet Union. The Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 (soomepoisid – 'Boys of Finland') was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. 70,000 Estonians were recruited to the German armed forces (including Waffen-SS). Most of them joined in 1944, when the threat of a new invasion of Estonia by the Red Army had become imminent and it was clear that Germany would not win the war.

By January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Red Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. Narva was evacuated. Jüri Uluots, the last legitimate Prime Minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the constitution of Estonia) before its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered as a private citizen a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service. (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38,000 volunteers jammed registration centers. Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly-formed Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia's independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence.[7]

By 10 July 1941, the German armed forces had occupied all of Latvia's territory. Latvia became a part of Nazi Germany's Reichskommissariat Ostland as the Province General of Latvia (Generalbezirk Lettland). Anyone who was disobedient to the German occupation regime or had co-operated with the Soviet regime was killed or sent to concentration camps.

Immediately after the installation of German authority (the beginning of July 1941) a process of eliminating the Jewish and Gypsy population began, with many killings taking place in Rumbula. The killings were committed by Einsatzgruppe A, the Wehrmacht and Marines (in Liepāja), as well as by Latvian collaborators, including the 500–1,500 members of the infamous Sonderkommando Arajs (or Arajs Kommando) which alone killed around 26,000 Jews, and the 2,000 or more Latvian members of the SD.[8][9] By the end of 1941 almost the entire Jewish population had been exterminated. In addition, some 25,000 Jews were brought from Germany, Austria and the present-day Czech Republic, of whom around 20,000 were killed.

Latvia's population perished not only on the battlefield. During the years of Nazi occupation special campaigns exterminated 18,000 Latvians, approximately 70,000 Jews and 2,000 Gypsies – in total about 90,000 people. The Latvians among these were mostly civilians whose political convictions were unacceptable to the German occupation force. Jewish and Gypsy civilians were eliminated as a result of Nazi Germany's racial policy. Persecutions were mostly carried out by special German units (Einsatzgruppe A, Sicherheitsdienst, or SD) and police units. The German occupation regime attempted to involve the local population in war crimes. Thus, Latvian self-defence units, security police units, and SD auxiliary units were created and included volunteers who carried out part of the terror campaign.

In 1943 and 1944 two divisions of Waffen SS were formed from Latvian volunteers to fight against the Red Army.

A large number of Latvians resisted the German occupation.[citation needed] The Latvian resistance movement was divided between the pro-independence units under the Latvian Central Council and the Soviet partisan units under the Central Staff of the Partisan Movement in Moscow. Their Latvian commander was Arturs Sproģis.

The occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany refers to the period from the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union to the end of the Battle of Memel (22 June 1941 – 28 January 1945). At first the Germans were welcomed as ""liberators"" from the repressive Soviet regime.[citation needed] In the hope of re-establishing independence or at least gaining autonomy, Lithuanians organized their Provisional Government.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_the_Baltic_states_during_World_War_II

Taxation in Lithuania,"Taxes in Lithuania are levied by the central and the local governments. Most important revenue sources include the value added tax, personal income tax, excise tax and corporate income tax, which are all applied on the central level. In addition, social security contributions are collected in a social security fund, outside the national budget. Taxes in Lithuania are administered by the State Tax Inspectorate, the Customs Department and the State Social Insurance Fund Board. In 2019, the total government revenue in Lithuania was 30.3% of GDP.[1]

Before the 16th century, finances in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were based on barter. The first taxes (duoklė (""tribute""), dėkla (grain and hay trubite) and mezliava [lt]) were paid in farm products. The first cash taxes were introduced during the reign of Kęstutis, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).

In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a treasury court was established in 1591, followed by the treasury tribunal in 1613 that presided over tax cases until 1764. The taxes were set by Sejm. Taxes introduced in the 17th and 18th centuries included padūmė (tax on holdings), hiberna (tax for quartering), kvarta (tax on government estates) and pagalvė (pillow tax, payable per individual).[3] After the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the taxation system in Lithuania was subordinated to the respective partitioning powers. Taxes collected during this period were mostly on land, rents, trade and manufacture.

Taxes were again collected by the newly independent Lithuanian state after 1918. The Law on Taxes was introduced on 23 January 1919, followed by a number of additional tax laws. Taxes introduced included direct taxes (e.g., land tax, real estate tax, business tax, inheritance tax) and indirect taxes (e.g., excise taxes on drinks, tobacco, precious metals, as well as tariffs).

During the Soviet occupation, the Lithuanian financial system, including taxes, was integrated into the Soviet one. The personal income tax was progressive and ranged from 0.35 to 13 percent on income above the non-taxable amount. Local taxes were also collected: house and land ownership tax, as well as vehicle ownership tax.

The modern tax system in Lithuania was gradually reestablished in the early 1990s with the introduction of corporate income and personal income taxes in 1990, land tax in 1992 and the Law on Tax Administration in 1995, amongst a lot of other tax related legislation.

The modern tax system in Lithuania is based on the Constitution of Lithuania. Articles 65 and 127 of the constitution enshrine two key tenets of the tax system: taxes can only be introduced by law and only Seimas can introduce tax laws. Key tax laws in Lithuania include Law on Tax Administration, Law on Customs and the individual laws for specific taxes.[4] The tax practice is also affected by international treaties, including numerous bilateral tax treaties for the Avoidance of Double Taxation to which Lithuania is part. As part of the European Union, taxation system in Lithuania is also heavily affected by European rules and regulations, particularly in the areas of VAT and tariffs.

The main principles of tax administration in Lithuania, as defined by law, are:

Most taxes in Lithuania are administered by the State Tax Inspectorate, except social security and health insurance taxes which are administered by the State Social Insurance Fund Board and tariffs which are administered by the Customs Department. The Customs also administer the part of value added tax and excise duties where they relate to goods imported and exported. Some tax administration functions are also performed by the Ministry of Environment Protection and the Ministry of Agriculture.

The most important taxes collected in Lithuania include the personal income tax, corporate income (profit) tax, value added tax and excise tax which together accounted for 96.7% of tax revenue or 78.4% of total revenue in the national budget (including municipal budgets) in 2020.[5] All of these taxes are collected in the state budget, although a part of the personal income taxes collected from individuals are allocated to the municipality where that individual resides. The rules for this allocation are approved annually. Taxes on property are allocated fully to municipal budgets.

In 2019, the total government revenue in Lithuania was 30.3% of GDP.[1] Such ratio is slightly below the OECD average of 33.8%, but higher than of several other developed economies such as USA, Australia and Switzerland.[6]

Personal income tax (Lithuanian: Gyventojų pajamų mokestis or GPM)[7] is levied on residents and certain non-residents. Residents are taxed on their worldwide income, including income from employment, self-employment, investment income and capital gains. Non-residents may be taxed on certain types of income deemed to originate in Lithuania, including employment income, interest, income from distributed profit and income arising from real estate or other property. Relief from double taxation is available in some cases.[8]

There is an income tax threshold (Lithuanian: Neapmokestinamasis pajamų dydis or NPD). Basic tax rate for income from employment is 20% and the higher rate is 32%.[7] Income from dividends is taxed at a rate of 15%. Tax rate varies for other types of income. Thresholds are adjusted annually based on the national average wage and overall rates may also depend on personal circumstances (number of children, disability reliefs, etc).

Contributions to the social security fund are due on income from employment. They are paid to the State Social Insurance Fund Board (Lithuanian: Valstybinio socialinio draudimo fondo valdyba or Sodra) and are colloquially known as the Sodra taxes (Lithuanian: Sodros mokesčiai). They consist of two main taxes: state social insurance (Lithuanian: Valstybinis socialinis draudimas or VSD) and compulsory healthcare insurance (Lithuanian: Privalomasis sveikatos draudimas or PSD). Generally, all residing citizens and permanent residents are required to pay the compulsory healthcare insurance (PSD) contributions.[9]

As of 2021, employee contributions are withheld from the salary at a rate of 19.5%-22.5%, depending on the chosen contributions to different pillars of the pension funds. This includes 6.98% tax rate of the compulsory healthcare insurance (PSD). The employer contributions are usually 1.77%, but may vary (0.14%-2.49%) depending on the type of employment, industry, activity type, etc.[10] Individuals other than employees, including the self-employed, sport persons, artists and farmers, may be subject to social security contributions at different rates. Social security contributions have a ""ceiling"" (Lithuanian: Sodros įmokų lubos) i.e. a threshold after which the contributions are not deducted.[11]

In general, income tax and the social security contributions might take about 40% of the gross salary.[12]

Corporate income tax (Lithuanian: Pelno mokestis, literally profit tax)[13] is levied on Lithuanian companies, companies operating in Lithuania through a permanent establishment, and non-resident companies. Lithuanian companies are taxed on their worldwide income, allowing for deduction for income generated through permanent establishments in other countries in accordance with international treaties. Companies operating in Lithuania through a permanent establishment are taxed on the profit attributed to such permanent establishment. Non-resident companies are taxed on certain income that is considered to originate in Lithuania, such as dividends, interest and royalties, although exceptions exist.[14]

Most companies are taxed at a rate of 15%.[13] The rate of 5% is applied for small companies and agricultural enterprises, as defined by law. Startups enjoy the rate of 0% for the first fiscal year (if income does not exceed 300 000 EUR). The rate of 10% is applied on the interest and royalty income paid to non-resident companies. Non-profit organisations, social enterprises, businesses engaged in shipping or some other activities may be taxed on a different basis. Participation exemption applies to dividend paid/received from closely held companies and capital gains from shares of closely held companies, as defined by law.

The value added tax (Lithuanian: Pridėtinės vertės mokestis or PVM)[15] is levied on goods and services that are subject to VAT according to law. The VAT in Lithuania is part of the European Union value added tax system.

The standard VAT rate in Lithuania is 21%.[15] Certain goods and services are subject to reduced VAT rates of 9% (e.g., most books, periodicals and passenger transportation services), 5% (e.g., medicines, medical equipment, equipment for disabled, etc) and 0% (e.g., international transportation).[16] Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT (e.g., financial services).[15]

Excise taxes (Lithuanian: Akcizo mokesčiai)[17] in Lithuania are applied on imported or locally manufactured and sold products:

Excise tax rates are set by law and have changed frequently, driven by the minimum tax rates required by European Union, as well as local budgetary and public interest considerations, as the tax contributes significantly to the national budget, while many of the products taxed (i.e., alcohol and tobacco products) have negative effects on public health.

As of 2015, the excise tax rates on tobacco products were due to meet the minimum rates required by the European Union by 2018.[18] The relatively low rates in Lithuania are mostly driven by the presence of a significant black market for cigarettes, which are illegally imported from Russia and Belarus.

At the same time, the excise taxes on alcohol products are substantially higher than the minimum levels required by European Union, exceeding them already in 2004, especially for spirits. The increases have been driven by budgetary and public health considerations (alcohol consumption in Lithuania is among the highest in Europe),[19] but have attracted criticism for contributing to the widespread black market. Beer, on the other hand, is relatively mildly taxed compared to other European countries.[20]

The black market for goods  subject to excise tax has been cited as the main reason for the excise taxes in Lithuania failing to meet either budgetary or public health goals. The black market benefits from close proximity to Russia and Belarus, widespread tolerance among the population and the prices of legally available goods being high relative to income. Black market sales are estimated to constitute 33% of all sales for spirits (although only 4–5% for low-alcohol beverages that enjoy lower excise tax rates), 35% for cigarettes and 15 to 20% for vehicle fuel. Therefore, further increasing excise taxes beyond the minimum level set by European Union has been criticized as counter-productive.[20]

The Law on Tax Administration sets the list of 25 taxes (as of 2015) levied in Lithuania. Other than the taxes outlined above, they include taxes on real estate and land, natural resources, pollution, inheritance, lotteries and gambling, as well as fees for services provided by the government (e.g., registration of industrial property) and certain taxes in the sugar industry.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Lithuania

Henrician Articles,"The Henrician Articles or King Henry's Articles (Polish: Artykuły henrykowskie; Lithuanian: Henriko artikulai;[1] Latin: Articuli Henriciani) were a constitution in the form of a permanent agreement made in 1573 between the ""Polish nation"" (the szlachta, or nobility, of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and a newly-elected Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke upon his election to the throne. The Articles were the primary constitutional law of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[2][3]

While pacta conventa (a sort of manifesto or government programme) comprised only the personal undertakings of the king-elect, the Henrician Articles were a permanent constitutional law which all King-Grand Dukes were obligated to swear to uphold.[2][4]

The articles functioned essentially as the first constitution for Poland-Lithuania until the Constitution of 3 May 1791.[2][3]

The charter took the form of 18 articles written and adopted by the Polish-Lithuanian nobility in 1573 at the town of Kamień, near Warsaw, during the interregnum after the extinction of the Jagiellon dynasty.[3] The document took its name from that of Henry of Valois, the first Polish king and  Lithuanian grand duke elected in a free election. He was obliged to sign the Articles to be allowed to ascend the throne.[3] Subsequently, every king-elect was required to swear fidelity to them, like the similar documents, the pacta conventa, but the latter were tailored and different for each king-elect.[2] Acceptance by the king-elect of the articles was a condition for his elevation to the throne, and they formed part of the royal oath at the coronation.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrician_Articles

Lithuanian partisans,"Lithuanian partisans (Lithuanian: Lietuvos partizanai) were partisans who waged guerrilla warfare in Lithuania against the Soviet Union in 1944–1953. Similar anti-Soviet resistance groups, also known as Forest Brothers and cursed soldiers, fought against Soviet rule in Estonia, Latvia and Poland. An estimated total of 30,000 Lithuanian partisans and their supporters were killed.[3] The Lithuanian partisan war lasted almost for a decade, thus becoming one of the longest partisan wars in Europe.

At the end of World War II, the Red Army pushed the Eastern Front towards Lithuania. The Soviets invaded and occupied Lithuania by the end of 1944. As forced conscription  into Red Army and Stalinist repressions escalated, thousands of Lithuanians took to the forests in the countryside as a refuge. These spontaneous groups became more organized and centralized culminating in the establishment of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters in February 1948. In their documents, the partisans emphasized that their ultimate goal was the recreation of independent Lithuania. As the partisan war continued, it became clear that the West would not interfere in Eastern Europe (see Western betrayal) and the partisans had no chance of success against a far stronger opponent. Eventually, the partisans made an explicit and conscious decision not to accept any new members. The leadership of the partisans was destroyed in 1953 thus effectively ending the partisan war, though individual fighters held out until the 1960s.

Lithuania regained its independence in 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire. As pre-war tensions rose in Europe, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Subsequently, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940. The Soviets instituted Sovietization policies and repressions. In June 1941, the Soviets deported over 17,000 Lithuanians to Siberia, with most of the deportees dying in the harsh winters. When a few days Germany launched an invasion of Russia, Lithuanians organized a popular anti-Soviet uprising. Initially, the Lithuanians greeted the Germans as liberators from the repressive Soviet rule and made plans to reestablish independent Lithuania. However, the attitudes soon changed as the occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany continued.

Unlike Estonia and Latvia where the Germans conscripted the local population into military formations in the Waffen-SS, Lithuania boycotted German recruitment calls and never had their own Waffen-SS division. In 1944, the Nazi authorities authorized the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (LTDF) under General Povilas Plechavičius to combat Soviet partisans led by Antanas Sniečkus and the Polish partisans of the Home Army. The LTDF soon reached a strength of 19,500 men. The Germans, however came to see the LTDF as a nationalist threat to their occupation regime and its senior staff were arrested on May 15, 1944. General Plechavičius was deported to the Salaspils concentration camp in Latvia. However, a large proportion of the LTDF succeeded in escaping deportation to Germany and formed guerrilla units, dissolved into the countryside in preparation for partisan operations against the Soviet Army as the Eastern Front approached.[4][5]

On July 1, 1944, the Lithuanian Liberty Army (Lithuanian: Lietuvos laisvės armija, LLA) declared a state of war against the Soviet Union and ordered all able-bodied members to mobilize into platoons stationed in the forests and not to leave Lithuania. The departments were replaced by two sectors – operational, called Vanagai (Hawks or Falcons; abbreviated VS), and organizational (abbreviated OS). Vanagai, commanded by Albinas Karalius (codename Varenis), were the armed fighters while the organizational sector was tasked with passive resistance, including supply of food, information, and transport to Vanagai. In the middle of 1944, the LLA had 10 000 members.[6] The Soviets had killed 659 and arrested 753 members of the LLA by January 26, 1945. Founder Kazys Veverskis was killed in December 1944, and its headquarters were liquidated in December 1945. This represented the failure of highly centralized resistance; the organization was depended too much on Veverskis and other top commanders. In 1946 the remaining leaders and fighters of the LLA started to merge with Lithuanian partisans. In 1949 all members of the presidium of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters – captain Jonas Žemaitis-Tylius, Petras Bartkus-Žadgaila, and Bronius Liesys-Naktis ir Juozas Šibaila-Merainis – came from the LLA.[7]

The Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Vyriausiasis Lietuvos išlaisvinimo komitetas, VLIK) was created on November 25, 1943. VLIK published underground newspapers and agitated for resistance against the Nazis. The Gestapo arrested most influential members in 1944. After the reoccupation of Lithuania by the Soviets, VLIK moved to the West and set as its goal to maintain the non-recognition of Lithuania's occupation and dissemination of information from behind the Iron Curtain – including the information provided by the Lithuanian partisans.

Former members of the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force, the Lithuanian Liberty Army, Lithuanian Armed Forces and Lithuanian Riflemen's Union formed the basis of Lithuanian partisans. Farmers, Lithuanian officials, students, teachers, and even pupils joined the partisans. The movement was actively supported by Lithuanian society and the Catholic church. By the end of 1945, an estimated 30 000 armed people lived in the Lithuanian forests.

The resistance in Lithuania was well organized, and uniformed guerrilla units with a chain of command were effectively able to control whole regions of the countryside until 1949. Their armaments included Czech Škoda guns, Russian Maxim heavy machine guns, assorted mortars and a wide variety of mainly German and Soviet light machine guns and submachine guns.[4] When not directly fighting the Soviet Army or special NKVD units, they significantly delayed the consolidation of Soviet rule through ambush, sabotage, assassination of local Communist activists and officials, freeing imprisoned guerrillas, and printing underground newspapers.[8] Captured Lithuanian Forest Brothers often faced torture and summary execution, while their relatives faced deportation to Siberia (cf. quotation). Reprisals against pro-Soviet farms and villages were harsh. The NKVD units (known by the Lithuanians as pl. stribai, from the Russian: istrebiteli – destroyers) used cruel repression to discourage further resistance, e.g. displaying executed partisans' corpses in village courtyards.[4][9]

The partisans were well-armed. During 1945–1951 Soviet repressive structures seized from partisans 31 mortars, 2,921 machine guns, 6,304 assault rifles, 22,962 rifles, 8,155 pistols, 15,264 grenades, 2,596 mines, and 3,779,133 cartridges. The partisans usually replenished their arsenal by killing istrebiteli, members of Soviet secret-police forces or by purchasing ammunition from Red Army soldiers.[10] Every partisan had binoculars and few grenades. One grenade was usually saved to blow themselves and their faces to avoid being taken as prisoner, since the physical tortures of Soviet MGB/NKVD were very brutal and cruel, and being recognised, to prevent their relatives from suffering.

In the first year of partisan warfare, about 10,000 Lithuanians were killed – about half of the total deaths. Men avoided conscription to the Red Army and hid in the forests, spontaneously joining the Lithuanian partisans. Not all groups were armed or intended to actively fight the Soviets. Partisan groups were relatively large, 100 men and more. There were several larger open engagements between the partisans and NKVD, like in Kalniškė, Paliepiai, Seda, Virtukai, Kiauneliškis, Ažagai-Eimuliškis and the village of Panara. Since the Soviets had not established control, the partisans controlled entire villages and towns.

In July 1945, after the end of World War II, the Soviets announced an ""amnesty"" and ""legalization"" campaign for those hiding in the forests to avoid conscription. According to a Soviet report from 1957, in total 38,838 people came forward under the campaign (8,350 of them were classified as ""armed nationalist bandits"" and 30,488 as deserters avoiding conscription).[citation needed]

In the second stage of partisan warfare, the partisan groups became smaller but better organized. They organized themselves into units and military districts and sought better centralization. The territory of Lithuania was divided into three regions and nine military districts (Lithuanian: apygarda):

Open engagements with NKVD/MGB were replaced by more clandestine activities. It was important to keep up people's spirits. Therefore, the partisans hid in bunkers and engaged in political and propaganda activities. In particular they protested and disrupted elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in February 1946 and to the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in February 1947. They published bulletins, leaflets and newspapers. Almost 80 different periodicals were published by the partisans. MGB also changed its tactics and began to recruit agents and organize destruction battalions. The partisans responded by organizing reprisal actions against collaborators with the Soviets.

To combat the guerrillas, in May 1948 the Soviets carried out the largest deportation yet from Lithuania, Operation Spring, and some forty to fifty thousand people associated with the ""forest brothers"" were deported to Siberia.

In February 1949, partisan leaders met in the village of Minaičiai and established a centralized command, the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters. Brigadier General Jonas Žemaitis was elected chairman. On February 16, 1949, the 31st anniversary of the Act of Independence of Lithuania, the Joint Staff of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters signed a declaration on the future of Lithuania stating that the reinstated Lithuania should be a democratic state that would grant equal rights for every citizen based on freedom and democratic values. It did declare that the Communist party was a criminal organization. The document of the declaration survived and was preserved by the KGB. In 1999, the Lithuanian Seimas (parliament) formally recognized this declaration as a Declaration of Independence.

Juozas Lukša was among those who managed to escape to Western countries; he wrote his memoirs – Forest Brothers: The Account of an Anti-Soviet Lithuanian Freedom Fighter, 1944–1948 – in Paris, and was killed after returning to occupied Lithuania in 1951. By the early 1950s, the Soviet forces had eradicated most of the Lithuanian nationalist resistance. Intelligence gathered by the Soviet spies in the West and KGB infiltrators within the resistance movement, in combination with large-scale Soviet operations in 1952, managed to end the campaigns against them.[12]

Adolfas Ramanauskas (code name Vanagas), the last official commander of the Union of Lithuanian Freedom Fighters, was arrested in October 1956 and executed in November 1957. The last Lithuanian anti-Soviet resistance fighters killed in action were Pranas Končius (code name Adomas) and Kostas Liuberskis (code name Žvainys). Končius was killed on July 6, 1965 (some sources say he shot himself on July 13 in order to avoid capture) and awarded the Cross of Vytis in 2000. Liuberskis was killed on October 2, 1969; his fate was unknown until the late 2000s.[13] Stasys Guiga (code name Tarzanas) died in hiding in 1986.[14]

Many nationalist partisans persisted in the hope that Cold War hostilities between the West, which never formally recognized the Soviet occupation, and the Soviet Union might escalate to an armed conflict in which Lithuania would be liberated. This never materialized, and many of the surviving former partisans remained bitter that the West did not take on the Soviets militarily.[15]

As the conflict was relatively undocumented by the Soviet Union (the Lithuanian fighters were never formally acknowledged as anything but ""bandits and illegals""), some consider it and the Soviet-Lithuanian conflict as a whole is an unknown or forgotten war.[4][16][17] Discussion of resistance was suppressed under the Soviet regime. Writings on the subject by the Lithuanian emigrants were often labelled by Soviet propaganda as examples of ""ethnic sympathy"" and disregarded.[18]

In Lithuania, freedom fighter veterans receive a state pension. The third Sunday in May is commemorated as Partisan's Day. As of 2005, there were about 350 surviving partisans in Lithuania.[19]

Žaliukas (""Green man"") is the Lithuanian partisan-inspired qualification patch in the Lithuanian Special Operations Forces given to the very best. Žaliukas is the word for the state of alert of the unyielding part of the nation in the face of danger.[20]

Lithuanian courts view Soviet repressions against Lithuanian partisans as crimes against humanity. In 2016, the Supreme Court of Lithuania ruled that the systematic extermination of the partisans by the Soviet regime constituted a genocide.[21] In 2019, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the view of the national courts that these Soviet repressions could be deemed genocide.[22]

The 1966 film Nobody Wanted to Die (Lithuanian: Niekas nenorėjo mirti) by Soviet-Lithuanian film director Vytautas Žalakevičius shows the tragedy of the ""brother against brother"" conflict. Despite being propaganda shot from a Soviet perspective, the film alludes to the possibility of alternative points of view. The film brought acclaim to Žalakevičius, and to a number of young Lithuanian actors starring in the film.

The 2004 film Utterly Alone (Lithuanian: Vienui Vieni) portrays the travails of Lithuanian partisan leader Juozas Lukša who traveled twice to Western Europe in attempts to gain support for the armed resistance.

The 2005 documentary film Stirna tells the story of Izabelė Vilimaitė (codenames Stirna and Sparnuota), an American-born Lithuanian who moved to Lithuania with her family in 1932. A medical student and pharmacist, she was an underground medic and source of medical supplies for the partisans, eventually becoming a district liaison. She infiltrated the local Komsomol (Communist Youth), and was twice discovered and captured, and escaped. After going underground full-time, she was suspected of having been turned by the KGB as an informant and was nearly executed by the partisans. Her bunker was eventually discovered by the KGB and she was captured a third time, interrogated and killed.[23][24]

In 2008, an American documentary film, Red Terror on the Amber Coast was released, documenting the Lithuanian resistance to the Soviet occupation from the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.[25]

In 2014, The Invisible Front, a documentary focusing on Juozas Lukša, was released in the US.[26]

In 2021, Icelandic composer and producer Ólafur Arnalds released a track titled Partisans, honoring the Lithuanian partisan resistance.[27]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_partisans
2011 Lithuanian census,"The Lithuanian census of 2011 collected demographic data of the country as of March 1, 2011. The census itself was conducted during March-May 2011.[1] This was the second census in Lithuania after the restoration of independence and the first census since its accession to the European Union in 2004.[2]

The census surveyed all permanent residents of Lithuania.[1]

66.7% of population lived in urban areas, 40.2% lived in the major cities.  Country's population decreased by about 440 thousand, from 3.48 million in 2001  to 3.043 million in 2011. The urban population decreased by 12.9% (300.9 thousand), rural population – by 12.1% (139.7 thousand)[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Lithuanian_census

Polish–Lithuanian War,"The Polish–Lithuanian War was an undeclared war fought in the aftermath of World War I between newly independent Lithuania and Poland, with fighting mainly in the Vilnius and Suwałki regions, which was part of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence and lasted from May 1919 to 29 November 1920.[3] Since the spring of 1920, the conflict happened alongside the wider Polish–Soviet War[6] and was affected by its progress. It was subject to unsuccessful international mediation at the Conference of Ambassadors and the League of Nations.

After World War I, the military and political situation in the region was chaotic, as multiple countries, notably Lithuania, Poland, and Soviet Russia, vied with each other over control of overlapping areas.[a] The Polish–Lithuanian conflict was centered on Vilnius,[3] which the Council of Lithuania declared the capital of the restored Lithuanian state.[7] Control of Vilnius was transferred from Germans to Poles on January 2, 1919, but the Polish paramilitary lost the city to the Bolsheviks on January 5.[8] The Polish Army seized Vilnius again on April 19, 1919[9] and came in contact with the Lithuanian Army fighting in the Lithuanian–Soviet War. Despite the antagonism over Vilnius, the Lithuanian and Polish armies sometimes cooperated when fighting against a common enemy, the Bolsheviks.[6] As Lithuanian–Polish relations worsened, the Entente drew two demarcation lines in hopes to stall further hostilities. The lines did not please either side and were ignored. The first clashes between Polish and Lithuanian soldiers occurred on April 26 and May 8, 1919, near Vievis.[10] With the Polish coup against the Lithuanian government failing in August 1919, the front stabilized until the summer of 1920.

In July 1920, Polish forces retreated due to reverses in the Polish–Soviet War and the Lithuanians followed the retreating troops to secure their lands as delineated in the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. However, the Red Army was the first to enter Vilnius. In August 1920, Poland won the Battle of Warsaw and forced the Soviets to retreat. The Polish Army encountered Lithuanian opposition, defending their new borders, which the Polish government considered illegitimate. Thus, the Polish invaded Lithuanian-controlled territory during the Battle of Sejny. Pressured by the League of Nations, Poland signed the Suwałki Agreement on October 7, 1920. The agreement left the Suwałki region on the Polish side and drew a new incomplete demarcation line, which left Vilnius vulnerable to a flanking maneuver.[11]

On October 8, 1920, Polish general Lucjan Żeligowski staged a mutiny, secretly planned and authorized by the Polish chief of state Józef Piłsudski. Żeligowski's forces marched on Vilnius and captured it one day before the Suwałki Agreement was to formally come into effect.[12] Żeligowski proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Central Lithuania with its capital in Vilnius. Their further offensive towards Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania, was halted by the Lithuanians, who thus defended their independence. On November 29, 1920, a ceasefire was signed. Overall, from early 1919 to late 1920, Vilnius would switch rule[b] as many as seven times between Lithuanians, Poles and the Bolsheviks.[3] The Republic of Central Lithuania was incorporated into Poland as the Wilno Voivodeship in 1922. The prolonged mediation by the League of Nations did not change the situation and the status quo was accepted in 1923. In March 1923, the Conference of Ambassadors recognized the armistice line as a de jure Polish–Lithuanian border, awarding Vilnius to Poland.[20][21] However, the International Court of Justice in The Hague arbitrated in 1931 that Poland broke international law by occupying Vilnius.[22] Lithuania remained adamant regarding its claim to Vilnius as its constitutional capital throughout the whole interwar,[21] and breaking all diplomatic relations with Poland due to the latter's control of the city. Diplomatic relations were only restored as a result of the March 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania. Vilnius was regained by Lithuania on 28 October 1939, following the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty, twenty years after losing its capital. However, Lithuania as a whole lost its independence less than a year later following the Soviet ultimatum and occupation of the Baltic states.

According to the 1897 Russian census, the disputed city of Vilnius had a linguistic breakdown of 30% Polish speaking, 40% Jews, and 2% Lithuanian speaking;[23][24] however the percentage of Lithuanian speakers in the surrounding countryside was a few times higher than that of Polish speakers – the population was 35% Lithuanian and 12% Polish speaking in Vilnius county (if excluding its centre - Vilnius city),[25] while Trakai county had 59% Lithuanian and 11% Polish speaking population.[26] According to the 1916 German census, Poles were the most numerous among all local nationalities and constituted 53%[27] or 53.67% of the city's population,[28] 50% in the entire Vilnius census region and the vast majority in the Vilnius census district.[27]

World War I ended when Germany signed the Armistice of 11 November 1918. On November 13, Soviet Russia renounced the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk[29] and began the Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919. The Bolsheviks followed retreating Imperial German Army troops and attacked Lithuania and Poland from the east trying to prevent their independence. They attempted to spread the global proletarian revolution, establish Soviet republics in the region, and join the German and the Hungarian Revolutions.[30] The Soviet offensive sparked a series of local wars, including the Polish–Soviet War and the Lithuanian–Soviet War.

At the end of 1918, four groups claiming authority existed in Vilnius: the occupational Ober Ost German government, which was preparing to leave the city; the Lithuanian government under Augustinas Voldemaras that had just begun creating the Lithuanian Army; the Polish Committee and the Polish Temporary National Council for Lithuania supported by armed units of the Self-Defence of Lithuania and Belarus; and Vilnius Soviet of Workers Deputies waiting for the Red Army.[31] The Germans refused to provide weapons to Polish paramilitary units which intended to fight the approaching Red Army. The Ober Ost command also denied the Polish request to grant the Polish Land Forces free passage to Vilnius.[32][33] The Polish Self-Defence was formally absorbed into the Polish Army at the end of December.[34] On 2 January 1919, Poles took over Vilnius from the retreating German troops and the fighting with the city's Bolshevik Worker's Soviet (capturing around 1,000 weapons[35]).[17] Nonetheless, the last German soldiers left the city only on January 4.[36] The Lithuanian government failed to organize a defense of Vilnius.[37][38] Both the Polish and Lithuanian political leadership realized their inability to resist the invading Bolshevik forces.[39] So, on January 2, the Council of Lithuania evacuated from Vilnius to Kaunas.[40] After some fighting, the local Polish forces lost Vilnius to the Bolsheviks on January 5.[41][8] Lithuanians relied on the aid of German troops to stop the Red Army offensive before it reached Kaunas.[42]

At first, the Soviets were successful but this came to a halt in February 1919 due to failures at the battles of Jieznas, Kėdainiai, and Alytus. On February 5, Poland signed an agreement with Germany regulating the withdrawal of the German army from western Belarus and giving the Polish army the opportunity to march eastward. On February 14, 1919, Polish troops came into contact with the Bolshevik army near Vawkavysk.[43] On April 16, 1919, the Polish Army launched a wide-ranging offensive against the Bolsheviks from Lida to Vilnius.[44] On April 19, 1919, the Polish cavalry under Władysław Belina-Prażmowski captured Vilnius.[45] On April 22, 1919, Józef Piłsudski issued the Proclamation to the inhabitants of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, in which he announced that the region's fate would be decided democratically. He also established the Civil Administration of the Eastern Lands, headed by Jerzy Osmołowski [pl].[46] An important strategic success for the Polish side was the capture of Grodno on April 28, 1919, from which the Germans withdrew.[47]

After that Polish troops advanced further west and northwest. The situation was utilized by the Lithuanian army, which entered Ukmergė on May 3, and started an offensive further south and southwest.[6] Polish–Lithuanian relations at the time were not immediately hostile, both armies met in several points (Merkinė, Vievis and Širvintos), and even cooperated against the Bolsheviks in Giedraičiai area on May 11, 1919.[48]

At first, both Poles and Lithuanians cooperated against the Soviets, but soon the cooperation gave way to increasing hostility.[49][48] Lithuania claimed neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. As the Polish Army forced its way further into Lithuania, the first clashes between Polish and Lithuanian soldiers occurred on April 26 and May 8, 1919, near Vievis.[10] Though there was no formal state of war and few casualties, by July newspapers reported increasing clashes between Poles and Lithuanians, primarily around the towns of Merkinė and Širvintos.[50] Direct negotiations in Kaunas between May 28 and June 11, 1919, collapsed as neither side agreed to compromise. Lithuania tried to avoid direct military conflict and submitted its case for mediation to the Conference of Ambassadors.[51]

In the Suwałki region, Lithuanian troops, supported by German troops, were advancing in a southerly direction. The entire region was under the control of the German army, which allowed in the southern part to organize Polish administrations and to hold elections to the Polish Sejm in the counties of Augustów, Suwałki and Sejny. However, at the same time, they allowed the formation of Lithuanian administrations in the northern part.[52] Lithuanians controlled Sejny from mid-1918, and entered Suwałki on May 8, 1919.[53]

While still World War I was still ongoing, under German tutelage, the two sides established diplomatic ties, signing an agreement in Berlin on 30 June 1918.[54] Lithuania was represented by Augustinas Voldemaras and Konstantinas Olšauskas, while Poland was represented by Adam Ronikier.[54] Both sides recognized each other's statehood.[55] In the treaty, Lithuania guaranteed the rights of the Polish minority, while Poland promised to refrain from anti-Lithuanian propaganda.[56] Voldemaras later maintained that Ronikier renounced Polish claims to Vilnius.[57] However, Alfred E. Senn wrote that the issue of the border and the belonging of Vilnius was not addressed in the treaty,[55] while according to Pranas Čepėnas and Wiktor Sukiennicki [pl] the signed agreement mentioned nothing regarding territorial questions.[57] The treaty (published in full by Raimundas Lopata [lt]) was of interim nature and stated only that: ""With regard to the frontier, a principle of a common frontier is accepted, which will be determined by a joint agreement based on ethnic, historic and economic principles"".[58] After the Germans had withdrawn, the Lithuanian side pressed for Poland's recognition of an independent Lithuania with its capital in Vilnius, which the Polish leadership consistently rejected.[59]

Polish leader Józef Piłsudski hoped to revive the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (see the Intermarium federation) and campaigned for some kind of Polish–Lithuanian union in the Paris Peace Conference.[59] Oppositional Endecja desired Lithuania's annexation to Poland,[60] with granting Lithuanians territorial autonomy within ethnic boundaries.[61] Poland also did not intend to make any territorial concessions and justified its actions not only as part of a military campaign against the Soviets but also as the right of self-determination of local Poles.[62] Due to Polish–Lithuanian tensions, the Allied Powers withheld diplomatic recognition of Lithuania until 1922.[63]

The Lithuanians claimed Vilnius as their historical capital and refused any federation with Poland, desiring an independent Lithuanian state. They regarded Polish federalism as a recreation of Polish cultural and political dominance.[59] The Lithuanian government in Kaunas, designated as the temporary capital, deemed the Polish presence in Vilnius as an illegal occupation.[64] In addition to the Vilnius Region, the Suwałki Region was also disputed. It had a mixed Polish and Lithuanian population.[65]

At the time the international situations of newly independent Poland and Lithuania were unequal. Poland, much larger in territory and population, was dedicated point #13 in Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. It was recognized by all nations of the Entente, officially invited to the Paris Peace Conference, and became one of the founding members of the League of Nations.[66] Poland also enjoyed a close alliance with France.

Lithuania did not receive international recognition (it was first recognized de jure in July 1920 by Soviet Russia as part of the peace treaty) as the Entente hoped to revive the Russian Empire within its former territory, which included Lithuania.[67] Lithuania was looking for support in Germany and Russia. In Paris, Voldemaras made contact with Russian delegates to the Paris Conference, who resented an independent Poland and were also interested in limiting its influence in the east and blocking a Polish-Lithuanian agreement. However, they had no real power in Russia, besides that they themselves considered Lithuania part of Russia, so no agreement was reached.[68] Contacts with the Germans were much more fruitful. Germany realized that France was interested in a strong Polish ally east of Germany. So, for their part, they supported the building of Lithuania, which would be unfriendly to Poland. Threatened from both sides, the Lithuanian government turned to Germany for military and financial assistance.[69] German troops remained in Kaunas in early 1919, and the government was supported by German loans.[70] The military presence in Lithuania also gave Germany cover for East Prussia and the ability to control the situation in Russia.[68]

The Lithuanian delegation was also present at the Paris Peace Conference, where its leader Augustinas Voldemaras focused on receiving recognition of independent Lithuania and its borders. Voldemaras demanded 125,000 square kilometers for Lithuania, not only with Vilnius but also Suwałki and Białystok. He also accused Poland of being partitionist, and portrayed Poland as an anti-Semitic state that was a threat to Lithuanian Jews.[61] On the other hand, Voldemaras battled negative propaganda that the Council of Lithuania was a German puppet, that Lithuanians harboured pro-Bolshevik attitudes,[66] or that Lithuania was too small and weak to survive without a union with Poland.[71] Under article 87 of the Versailles Treaty, the Principal Allied Powers reserved to themselves the right to determine Poland's eastern frontier.[72][73]

The war situation and the unstable political situation in both countries did not facilitate contacts between the two governments. Lithuanians protested the presence of Polish troops on Lithuanian territory in early January 1919, but the information reached Warsaw when Vilnius was already in Bolshevik hands. The Poles responded on February 12 by rejecting Lithuanian demands for lands they considered their own, but offered to open direct diplomatic talks. The Lithuanian delegation reached Warsaw on April 18, a day before the entrance of Polish troops to Vilnius.[74]

Meanwhile, Michal Römer, a Lithuanian patriot and veteran of Polish Legions under Piłsudski, went to Kaunas on a mission, and was expected to convince Lithuanian politicians of federation. However, he only found understanding among Lithuanians of Polish culture.[53] On April 17, Lithuanian politicians categorically rejected the federation's proposals.[53]

The Lithuanian delegation, led by Jurgis Šaulys, held talks with Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Jan Paderewski on May 13 and 23, and with Polish Head of State Józef Piłsudski on May 21.[75] The Polish side, strengthened by its possession of Vilnius, insisted on the establishment of a federation, with a common foreign policy, army command, railroad, treasury and post office, promising to establish borders favorable to Lithuania.[76] The Lithuanian side, on the other hand, demanded recognition of an independent Lithuania with Vilnius as its capital.[76] The talks failed, with the only result being the establishment of a Lithuanian consulate in Warsaw, headed by Antanas Kasakaitis [lt].[53]

The Conference of Ambassadors drew the first demarcation line on June 18, 1919.[77] The line, drawn about 5 km (3.1 mi) west of the Grodno–Vilnius–Daugavpils Railway, was based on the military situation on the ground rather than ethnic composition.[77][78] Neither Poles nor Lithuanians were content with the line. The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the line as it would require the Polish forces to retreat up to 35 km (22 mi).[78] The line also left the entire Suwałki region, with exception of Augustów, on the Lithuanian side.[53] The Lithuanians protested leaving Vilnius and Grodno under Polish control.[78] As German volunteers were departing from Lithuania and Lithuanian forces were preoccupied with battles against the Soviets in northern Lithuania, Poland ignored the demacration line and moved its forces on a 100 km (62 mi) wide front 20–30 km (12–19 mi) deeper eastward.[79]

On July 18, Ferdinand Foch proposed the second demarcation line, known as the Foch Line.[80] It was approved by the Entente on July 26. The Lithuanians were informed about the new line only on August 3.[81] Two major modifications favorable to the Poles were made: the Suwałki Region was assigned to Poland and the entire line was moved about 7 km (4.3 mi) west.[82] Again, both Poles and Lithuanians protested the line as it would require them to withdraw their armies from the Vilnius and Suwałki Regions respectively. The German administration, which had not yet retreated from the Suwałki Region, also opposed the Foch Line.[83] The new line did not immediately halt the hostilities. After a couple of Polish attacks on July 29 and August 2, the front stabilized.[84]

The Lithuanians retreated from Suwałki on August 7, 1919.[85] However, they stopped in ethnically mixed Sejny and formed a line on the Czarna Hańcza River – Wigry Lake.[86] They showed their intention to stay there permanently, which caused concern among the local Poles. On August 12, they organized a rally in Suwałki demanding incorporation into Poland.[86] Lithuanians also held a rally in Kaunas on August 17 protesting the Foch line, and a similar rally was later held in Sejny, where Prime Minister Mykolas Sleževičius arrived.[87]

The Sejny branch of Polish Military Organisation (PMO) began preparing for an uprising, scheduled for the night of August 22 to 23, 1919, right after German troops left the city. Between 900[86] and 1,200 partisans[80] joined PMO forces. On August 23, the Poles captured Sejny and attacked Lazdijai and Kapčiamiestis, towns on the Lithuanian side of the Foch Line.[86] The insurgents planned to march as far as Simnas.[80] Lithuanians recaptured Sejny on August 25 for a few hours. On August 26, regular Polish forces – the 41st Infantry Regiment [pl] – joined the PMO volunteers.[80] On September 5, the Lithuanians agreed to withdraw behind the Foch Line by September 7.[88] Poland secured Sejny and repressed Lithuanian cultural life: the Sejny Priest Seminary was expelled, Lithuanian schools and cultural organizations closed.[89] After the uprising, the mistrust of Poles prompted Lithuanian intelligence to intensify its investigations of Polish activities in Lithuania. This helped to detect and prevent a planned coup d'état in Kaunas to overthrow the government of Lithuania.[80]

Sometime in mid-July 1919,[90] PMO forces in Vilnius began planning a coup to replace the Lithuanian government with a pro-Polish cabinet, which would agree to a union with Poland (the proposed Międzymorze federation). Polish leader Józef Piłsudski believed there were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to carry out the coup.[80] On August 3, a Polish diplomatic mission, led by Leon Wasilewski and Tadeusz Kasprzycki, in Kaunas had a double purpose: propose a plebiscite in the contested territories[91] and assess preparedness for the coup.[92] On August 6, the Lithuanian government rejected the plebiscite proposal, stating that the disputed territories constitute ethnographic Lithuania.[91] According to Lithuanian historian Kazys Ališauskas, PMO planned to capture and hold Kaunas for a few hours until the arrival of the regular Polish troops, situated only some 40–50 km (25–31 mi) east from the city.[93] Piłsudski and his entourage were sincerely convinced that Taryba, who ruled Lithuania, had no real popular support and was merely a German creation. They were bolstered in this conviction by intra-Lithuanian quarrels, primarily between Lithuanian émigré leader Juozas Gabrys and newly elected President Smetona, who lacked democratic legitimacy. This conviction was reinforced by the constant presence of the German army in Lithuania.[94] The Germans' departure from Kaunas on July 11, 1919, created the conditions for military action.[95] Polish newspapers ran a propaganda campaign claiming that the Council of Lithuania was simply a German puppet.[96]

It managed to win the support of some Lithuanian politicians, most notably the aforementioned Gabrys, Defense Ministry employee Jurgis Aukštuolaitis, and even Lithuanian army commander Silvestras Žukauskas. However, it was not much, greater success was achieved in gaining the support of Kaunas Poles.[97] The coup was initially scheduled for the night of August 27 to 28 but was postponed to September 1.[98] The outbreak of the Sejny uprising, which reinforced resentment against Poles in Lithuania, further hindered the success of the coup.[99]

The postponement of the start of the coup turned out to be a fatal mistake, as some PMO units did not receive information about it and began operations on the original date, disrupting telegraph connections between Kaunas and the rest of the country.[99] Lithuanian intelligence discovered the coup, but did not have a list of PMO members. Lithuanian authorities began mass arrests of some 200 Polish activists, including 23 officers of the Lithuanian Army.[100][101] Kaunas was declared in a state of siege. Polish press saw mass arrests of Polish activists ""to whom no charge can be ascribed other than being Poles"" as proof of systematic anti-Polish policies of the German-ridden Lithuanian government.[102] Another wave of arrests took place on September 9 in Kaišiadorys, an important railroad junction, where about 100 people were arrested.[103] The PMO was little affected by the arrests and scheduled another coup attempt for the end of September. However, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members, including 369 names of members and 122 names of Lithuanians sympathetic to the PMO, and liquidated the organization in Lithuania.[104][105] The wave of arrests, included names outside the list, Lithuanian police used this as a pretext to arrest Polish activists, there were even murders.[105]

After the failure of the coup in Kaunas, there were numerous small border incidents. On September 17 and 18, Lithuanian troops attacked and occupied Musninkai and Širvintos, and were soon driven from them.[106] On September 19, 1919, Polish troops attacked Gelvonai and encroached towards Ukmergė.[107] On several occasions fights broke out regarding a strategically important bridge over the Šventoji River near Vepriai.[108] In October, when main Lithuanian forces were deployed against the Bermontians in northwestern Lithuania, the attacks intensified. Poles captured Salakas on October 5[93] and attacked Kapčiamiestis on October 12.[88] When Polish troops were engaged in combat with Soviet forces German troops attacked Alanta on January 11, 1920, and Stakliškės on January 14.[109] The front stabilized, but harassment of border guards and local villagers continued throughout early 1920.

In March 1920, fights erupted along the railroad stations in Kalkūni and Turmantas.[110][111] The situation was investigated by British and French observers and reported to the Entente. The situation somewhat improved only in late spring 1920, when most Polish troops were deployed in Ukraine during the Polish–Soviet War.[93]

At the time Lithuania faced a severe budget crisis – in 1919 its revenue was 72 million while expenses reached 190 million German marks.[112] While the government was struggling to obtain financial assistance and loans, deep cuts affected the army. Instead of increasing its armed forces to 40,000 men, Lithuania was forced to cut them to about 25,000.[113]

After the failed coup, Leon Wasilewski left Kaunas and settled in Vilnius. There he met twice, on September 15 and 24, with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Augustian Voldemaras. The talks concerned bilateral relations, the possibility of a plebiscite, and ended without any concrete agreements.[114] Wasilewski then began propaganda work involving Lithuanian activists Józef Albin Herbaczewski, priest Antanas Viskantas or Jurgis Aukštuolaitis, who had been released from prison, and published bilingual or Lithuanian-language press for this purpose.[115]

Meanwhile, British influence was increasing in the Baltic States, interested primarily in limiting German, but also French influence.[116] A British military mission was established in Kaunas, headed by Richard Barrington Ward. On September 19, 1919, along with 21 other British officers, General Frank Percy Crozier joined the newly established Lithuanian Army as an advisor to the General Staff. On September 25, 1919, the UK recognized the Lithuanian state de facto. The British also provided military equipment.[116]

Latvia fought against the German-Russian forces of Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. Latvia enjoyed the support of Poland. The fighting spread to Lithuania in October 1919. Poland offered to help, but the Lithuanians refused to allow passage through their territory. Fearing a Polish attack, Lithuania reached an agreement with the Bermontians and signed a truce on October 30, establishing the Tauragė-Šiauliai demacration line.[117] After the Latvian army breached the front, the Lithuanian army joined the counteroffensive. Later clashes were stopped by the intervention of an Entente representative, in order to not interrupt withdrawal of German troops. By December 15, all German forces were completely removed from Lithuania. At the same time, the plenipotentiary of the German government Ludwig Zimmerle [de] was forced to leave Kaunas.[118] On December 30, a Polish-Latvian alliance was signed, resulting in a joint fight for the liberation of Daugavpils, which was successful on January 5, 1920. Lithuanian troops attempted an early entry into the city, but without success.[119]

In April 1920, Lithuania held its first parliamentary elections, among the constituencies established were cities outside the Lithuanian administration: Vilnius, Lida, Grodno and Białystok. The Polish minority had limited opportunities for election campaigning, the only Polish newspaper was closed down, and as a result Poles received only 3 parliamentary seats.[120] Kazys Grinius became the new prime minister. On May 11, 1920, France recognized Lithuania de facto.[121] And on May 7, 1920, Lithuania began peace talks with Soviet Russia.[122]

On 25 April 1920, the Polish army and the remnants of Ukrainian People's Army under Petliura launched the large-scale Kiev offensive following the treaty of alliance.[123] Initially successful, the Polish Army started retreating after Russian counterattacks in early June 1920.[124] Soon the Soviet forces began to threaten Poland's independence as they reached and crossed the Polish borders. On July 9, Polish Prime Minister Władysław Grabski asked the Allied Powers in the Spa Conference for military assistance in the war with the Soviets.[125] The conference proposed that the Polish forces would withdraw behind the Curzon Line, the Soviet forces would stop 50 km (31 mi) to the east of the line, the Lithuanian forces would take control of Vilnius, and all other disputes would be settled via negotiations in London.[62] Grabski opposed the transfer of Vilnius, but under the pressure of British Prime Minister Lloyd George, agreed to the resolution on July 10.[126]

At the same time, the Soviets and Lithuanians negotiated the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty, which was signed on July 12, 1920. Russia recognized Lithuanian independence and withdrew any territorial claims. The treaty drew the eastern border of Lithuania, which the Lithuanians continued to claim as their de jure state border until World War II. Vilnius Region, including Braslaw (Breslauja), Hrodna (Gardinas), Lida (Lyda), and Vilnius, was recognized to Lithuania.[127] On August 6, after long and heated negotiations, Lithuania and Soviet Russia signed a convention regarding the withdrawal of Russian troops from the recognized Lithuanian territory.[128] However, the troops began to retreat only after the Red Army suffered a heavy defeat in Poland.[129]

The Bolshevik forces reached Lithuanian territory on July 7, 1920, and continued to push the Polish troops.[93] The Lithuanian Army moved to secure territories abandoned by the retreating Polish forces, reaching Turmantas on July 7, Tauragnai and Alanta on July 9, Širvintos and Musninkai on July 10, Kernavė, Molėtai, and Giedraičiai on July 11,[130] Maišiagala and Pabradė on July 13.[131] On July 13, the Polish command decided to transfer Vilnius to the Lithuanians following the Spa conference's resolution.[132] Lithuanians moved in, but their trains were stopped by Polish soldiers near Kazimieriškės.[131] Polish soldiers didn't receive orders to let Lithuanian troops go through.[133] This delay meant that the Bolsheviks were the first to enter Vilnius on July 14. By the time the first Lithuanian troops entered the city on July 15, it was already secured by the Soviets.[134] Poland sought to have Russians in the city as it would create much fewer complications when the Polish Army counterattacked.[134] Despite the Peace Treaty, the Soviets did not intend to transfer the city to the Lithuanians.[132] Indeed, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes to re-establish the Lithuanian SSR.[124][135]

Despite the setback in Vilnius, the Lithuanians continued to secure territories in the Suwałki Region. They took Druskininkai on July 17, Vištytis, Punsk, Giby, and Sejny on July 19, Suwałki on July 29,[129] Augustów on August 8.[136] The Polish units, afraid of being surrounded and cut off from the main Polish forces, retreated towards Łomża. The Lithuanian authorities started to organize themselves in the regained areas.[136]

Poland claimed that Lithuania violated its claim to neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War and in effect became a Soviet ally.[137] A secret clause of the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty allowed Soviet forces unrestricted movement within the Soviet-recognized Lithuanian territory for the duration of Soviet hostilities with Poland.[124] This clause was of a practical matter: Soviet troops already occupied much of the assigned territory and could not withdraw while hostilities with Poland continued.[138] Lithuanians were also simply unable to resist Soviet troops.[139] For example, when Lithuanians refused permission to use a road, the Soviets ignored Lithuanian protests and transported their troops and equipment regardless.[128] At the same time Polish soldiers were disarmed and interned. The largest group, a brigade under colonel Pasławski, was interned on July 18, 1920, near Kruonis.[140] On August 10, Lithuanians held 103 Polish officers and 3,520 private soldiers.[136] Poland also claimed that the Lithuanian troops actively participated in the Red Army's military operations.[141] This charge, based on memoirs of Soviet officials, lacks evidence.[142] Further military clashes between Polish and Lithuanian troops in the Suwałki Region were interpreted by Poland to show that ""the Lithuanian government has become an instrument of the Soviet government.""[143] Lithuania responded that it was defending its borders.[143]

The Russians suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Warsaw in mid-August 1920 and started withdrawing. They handed over Vilnius to the Lithuanians on August 26.[132] The Lithuanians hastily made preparations to secure the border, as determined by the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty. The soldiers were ordered to maintain neutrality: avoid hostilities and intern any Soviet or Polish troops that would cross the border.[144] On August 26, a Polish delegation, led by Colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz, arrived in Kaunas to negotiate the situation.[145] The Poles, lacking authority to discuss political issues, were concerned with military aspects. They sought permission to transport Polish troops through the territory of Lithuania, wanted access to a portion of the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway, and demanded that the Lithuanian troops would withdraw from the Suwałki Region behind the Curzon Line.[145] The Lithuanians refused to discuss military matters without a clear political Polish–Lithuanian border, that would be respected after the war.[145] Due to these fundamental disagreements and Polish attacks, the negotiations broke down on August 30.[146]

The Suwałki Region had strategic importance in the Polish–Soviet War. Following orders of Edward Rydz-Śmigły, Polish forces took Augustów from Lithuanians in a surprise attack on August 28.[146] Confused and disoriented, Lithuanians retreated from Suwałki and Sejny on August 30 and 31.[93] The Lithuanians reorganized, gathered their forces (11 battalions with 7,000 soldiers),[147] and organized a counterattack to retake lost territory on September 2.[93] The goal was to take and secure the Augustów–Lipsk–Grabowo–Grodno line.[93] The Lithuanians succeeded in re-taking Sejny and Lipsk and by September 4 reached the outskirts of Augustów.[93] On September 5, the Poles counterattacked and forced the Lithuanians to retreat.[148] On September 9, the Polish forces recaptured Sejny,[149] but the Lithuanians pushed back and regained Sejny and Giby on September 13 and 14.[150] Pending direct negotiations, hostilities were ceased on both sides.[151]

On September 6, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis proposed direct negotiations in Marijampolė.[152] On September 8, during a planning meeting of the Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to manoeuvre through the Lithuanian-held territory to the rear of the Soviet Army, stationed in Grodno.[153] In an attempt to conceal the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate.[153] The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.[154]

On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha delivered a diplomatic note to the League of Nations alleging that Lithuania violated its neutrality and asked to intervene in the Polish–Lithuanian War.[155][156] The League agreed to mediate and began its session on September 16. The resolution, adopted on September 20, urged both states to cease hostilities and adhere to the Curzon Line.[157] Poland was asked to respect Lithuanian neutrality if Soviet Russia agreed to do the same. Also, a special Control Commission was to be dispatched to the conflict zone to oversee the implementation of the resolution.[158] It was clear that the League had only a narrow goal to prevent armed hostilities and not to resolve the underlying territorial dispute.[139][159] The Lithuanian government accepted the resolution, but Poland reserved full freedom of action in preparation for the attack on the Soviets.[160][161]

On September 22, 1920, Poland attacked Lithuanian units in the Suwałki Region on a wide front.[159] Overwhelmed by 4–5 times larger Polish forces,[162] some 1,700[161]–2,000[163] Lithuanian troops surrendered and were taken prisoner.

Polish forces then marched, as planned on September 8, across the Neman River near Druskininkai and Merkinė to the rear of the Soviet forces near Grodno and Lida.[164] The Red Army hastily retreated. The Lithuanians had had limited intelligence warning that such an attack might occur,[162] but chose an inadequate defensive strategy and spread their forces too thinly along the entire Polish–Lithuanian front[163] without sufficient forces to protect the bridges across the Neman.[165] This attack, just two days after the resolution by the League of Nations to cease hostilities, put more pressure on Poland to settle the dispute peacefully.[166]

On September 26, the Poles captured Grodno[164] and the Polish foreign minister proposed new negotiations in Suwałki.[167] The Battle of the Niemen River drastically altered the balance of power: Vilnius, in Lithuanian hands since August 26, was now exposed to a Polish attack.[168] Indeed, the Poles had already decided to capture the city and used the negotiations in Suwałki to stall and buy the time necessary to make preparations.[169][170] The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.[171]

The negotiations between Poles, led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz, and Lithuanians, led by general Maksimas Katche, began on the evening of September 29, 1920.[171] Both sides agreed to an armistice but only to the west of the Neman River (the Suwałki Region).[172] Fighting to the east of the river continued around Marcinkonys, Zervynos, Perloja, Eišiškės.[173] The major point of contention, both diplomatic and military, was the train station in Varėna (Orany) on the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway. Major Lithuanian forces were still concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult.[172] Fighting east of the Neman River ceased only on October 6, when Polish troops had already captured the train station in Varėna.[154]

Negotiations regarding the demarcation line were difficult. In essence, the Lithuanians wanted a longer demarcation line to provide better protection for Vilnius. The Poles agreed only to a short line to provide the planned attack on Vilnius with space for operation.[174] The Polish delegation was also stalling to buy time for necessary preparations for an attack on Vilnius.[169][172] While Vilnius was not a topic of debate, it was on everybody's mind.[159] On October 4, the Control Commission, sent by the League according to its resolution of September 20, arrived to Suwałki.[161] The commission, led by French colonel Pierre Chardigny, re-energized the negotiations.[174] On October 7, at midnight,[174] the final agreement was signed. The treaty made not a single reference to Vilnius or the Vilnius Region.[175] The ceasefire was effective only along the demarcation line, which ran through the Suwałki Region to the train station in Bastuny. [pl][175] Thus the line was incomplete, did not protect the Vilnius Region,[176] but indicated it would be left on the Lithuanian side.[177]

Polish chief of state Józef Piłsudski ordered his subordinate, General Lucjan Żeligowski, to stage a mutiny with his 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division (16 battalions with 14,000 soldiers)[178] in Lida and capture Vilnius in fait accompli. The rebellion had two main goals: capture Vilnius and preserve Poland's international reputation. The League of Nations was mediating other Polish disputes, notably over the Free City of Danzig and Upper Silesia, and direct aggression against Lithuania could have hampered Polish bargaining positions.[179] While the Polish side officially held Żeligowski to be a deserter and did not support him,[135] Poland provided logistic support, including munitions and food rations,[180] to his units.[181][182] Żeligowski also received reinforcements, when, according to the official version, the mutiny spread further among the Polish troops.[154][183] His initial attack was secured on both sides by two Polish Armies.[184]

Żeligowski's Mutiny, in planning since mid-September,[166] began in the early morning of October 8, 1920, just a few hours after the signing of the Suwałki Agreement.[185] A provisional agreement was made in the Polish–Soviet War, which freed up Polish units for the attack on Lithuania.[176] As part of the ruse, Żeligowski wrote a note to the Polish command announcing his mutiny and expressing his disappointment with the Suwałki Agreement.[185] He claimed that his troops marched to defend the right of self-determination of the local Polish population.[185]

The Lithuanians were not prepared for the assault. They had only two battalions, stationed near Jašiūnai and Rūdninkai [lt] along the Merkys River, shielding the city from Poland.[154] Their main forces were still in the Suwałki Region and to the west from Druskininkai and Varėna. Without the railway, Lithuanian units could not be easily redeployed to protect Vilnius.[176] After it became clear that Żeligowski would not stop in Vilnius, Commander of the Lithuanian Army Silvestras Žukauskas, who had recently taken the position on October 6, ordered the city evacuated in the afternoon on October 8.[154] They left the city's administration to Entente official Constantin Reboul.[186] The first Polish units entered the city around 2:15 PM on October 9, Żeligowski entered Vilnius in the evening the same day.[187][c] He did not recognize Reboul's authority and Entente officials left the city in protest.[189] On October 12, Żeligowski proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Central Lithuania, with Vilnius as its capital.[188] The name aligned with Piłsudski's vision of historical Lithuania, divided into three cantons: Lithuanian-inhabited Western Lithuania with its capital in Kaunas, Polish-inhabited Central Lithuania with its capital in Vilnius, and Belarusian-inhabited Eastern Lithuania with its capital in Minsk.[188] Further developments of other cantons were prevented by Polish National Democracy, a party opposed to Piłsudski's federalist ideas.[188]

Żeligowski's units continued to advance: territories east of the city were taken without resistance[190] while Lithuanians defended in the west. Żeligowski took Švenčionys and Rūdiškės on October 10, Nemenčinė on October 11, Lentvaris on October 13, Rykantai on October 15.[154] The front somewhat stabilized on the southern (left) side of the Neris River, but fighting continued on the northern (right) side of Neris.[191] On October 18, the Lithuanian army began a failed counteroffensive trying to retake Vilnius.[192] When Polish cavalry manoeuvred towards Riešė, it learned from the local population the location of the command of the 1st Riflemen Division.[193] On October 21, the cavalry raided the village and took the entire command (including Stasys Nastopka) prisoner. Left without their commanders, the Lithuanians retreated and Poles took Maišiagala and Paberžė.[194] Żeligowski at this point offered peace negotiations but was refused by the Lithuanian command.[192] On October 26, another cavalry raid captured Dubingiai, Giedraičiai and Želva and threatened Ukmergė.[195] However, Lithuanians counterattacked and took back Želva on October 30 and Giedraičiai on November 1. For a while, the front stabilized.[191]

On November 17, the mutineers began a major attack. They planned to capture Kaunas, thus threatening Lithuanian independence,[196] by encircling the city from the north through Širvintos–Ukmergė–Jonava and Giedraičiai–Kavarskas–Kėdainiai.[191] Żeligowski's forces were about three times larger: 15 Polish battalions against 5 Lithuanian battalions.[197] One cavalry brigade managed to break through the Lithuanian defence lines near Dubingiai, reached Kavarskas, and continued towards Kėdainiai.[191] However, Lithuanians successfully stopped an attack on Ukmergė near Širvintos on November 19. About 200 Lithuanians manoeuvred through swamps to the rear of three Polish battalions.[198] Attacked from the front and rear, some 200 Poles were taken prisoner while others retreated.[199] The Lithuanians continued to attack and captured Giedraičiai on November 21. On the same day, a ceasefire was signed under pressure from the League of Nations.[200] The Polish cavalry brigade, pushed from Kėdainiai and cut off from its main forces, retreated through Ramygala–Troškūnai–Andrioniškis–Leliūnai[201] and rejoined Żeligowski's other units only on November 24.[200]

On October 11, 1920, the Lithuanian envoy in Paris Oscar Milosz asked the League of Nations to intervene in the renewed conflict with Poland.[202] On October 14, the Chairman of the League Léon Bourgeois issued a note condemning the aggression and asking Polish units to retreat.[203] Politicians in London even considered expelling Poland from the League.[204] When the League heard both arguments on October 26–28, Polish envoy Szymon Askenazy claimed that there was no conflict between Poland and Lithuania to mediate.[205] He maintained that the old conflict ended with signing ceasefires with Lithuania on October 7 and with Soviet Russia on October 12 and the new conflict was caused by Żeligowski,[205] who acted without approval from the Polish command, but with the moral support of the entire Polish nation.[206] Lithuanian envoy Augustinas Voldemaras argued that Poland orchestrated the mutiny and demanded strict sanctions against Poland.[207] The League refused to validate Żeligowski's action.[206] It suggested to hold a plebiscite in the contested areas. On November 6 and 7, both sides agreed[207] and Lithuanians began preparatory work.[208]

On November 19, Żeligowski proposed to the Control Commission, led by Chardigny, to cease hostilities.[209] Lithuanians agreed and a ceasefire was signed on November 21. Later this episode was criticized by Lithuanian commentators as at the time the Lithuanian Army had the initiative in the front and had a chance of marching on Vilnius.[196] However, the Lithuanians trusted the League of Nations would resolve the dispute in their favour[179] and were afraid that in case of an attack on Vilnius regular Polish forces would arrive to reinforce Żeligowski's units.[210]

Negotiations for a more permanent armistice, under the mediation of the Control Commission, began on November 27 in Kaunas.[210] Lithuania did not agree to negotiate directly with Żeligowski and thus legitimizing his actions.[196] Therefore, Poland stepped in as a mediator. Lithuania agreed as it hoped to put the talks back into the context of the Suwałki Agreement.[211] Poles rejected any withdrawal of Żeligowski's forces. No agreement could be reached regarding a demarcation line. On November 29, 1920, it was agreed only to cease hostilities on November 30, to entrust the Control Commission with the establishment of a 6 km (3.7 mi) wide neutral zone and to exchange prisoners.[210] The neutral zone existed until February 1923.[200]

The result of this war was that while Lithuania defended its independence against Poland and its puppet state Central Lithuania, Lithuania also lost a third of its territory and its capital. The issue would not be laid to rest during the interwar as no peace treaty was ever signed, and Lithuania–Poland relations were broken off until the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania. In 1920–1939, Lithuania and Poland were separated by a demarcation line that mostly followed the Foch Line, which meant that Vilnius and Suwałki region were under Polish rule.

In March 1921, the plans for a plebiscite were abandoned. Neither Lithuania, which was afraid of a negative result nor Poland, which saw no reason to change status quo, wanted the plebiscite.[211] The parties could not agree on which territory to carry out the vote and how Żeligowski's forces should be replaced by League's forces.[211] The League of Nations then moved on from trying to solve the narrow territorial dispute in the Vilnius Region to shaping the fundamental relationship between Poland and Lithuania. In 1921, Belgian Paul Hymans suggested several Polish–Lithuanian federation models, all rejected by both sides.[212] In January 1922, parliamentary election to the Wilno Diet (Sejm wileński) resulted in a landslide Polish victory. In its first session on February 20, 1922, the Diet voted for incorporation into Poland as the Wilno Land and then Voivodeship.[213] Polish Sejm accepted the resolution of the Diet.[213][214] The League of Nations ended its efforts to mediate the dispute. After Lithuanians seized the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, the League saw recognition of Lithuanian interest in Klaipėda as adequate compensation for the loss of Vilnius.[215] The League accepted the status quo in February 1923 by dividing the neutral zone and setting a demarcation line, which was recognised in March 1923 as the official Polish–Lithuanian border.[215] Lithuania did not recognize this border.[215]

Some historians, notably Alfred E. Senn, have asserted that if Poland had not prevailed in the Polish–Soviet War, Lithuania would have been invaded by the Soviets and would never have experienced two decades of independence.[216] Despite the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920, Lithuania was very close to being invaded by the Soviets in the summer of 1920 and being forcibly incorporated into that state, and only the Polish victory derailed that plan.[216]

The dispute over Vilnius remained one of the biggest foreign policy issues in Lithuania and Poland. Lithuania broke off all diplomatic relations with Poland and refused any actions that would recognize Poland's control of Vilnius even de facto.[217] For example, Lithuania broke off diplomatic relations with the Holy See after the Concordat of 1925 established an ecclesiastical province in Wilno and thereby acknowledged Poland's claims to the city.[218] Poland refused to formally recognize the existence of any dispute regarding the region since that would have lent legitimacy to the Lithuanian claims.[219] Railroad traffic and telegraph lines could not cross the border, and mail service was complicated. For example, a letter from Poland to Lithuania needed to be sent to a neutral country and repackaged in a new envelope to remove any Polish signs and only then could be delivered to Lithuania.[220] Despite several attempts to normalize the relations, the situation of ""no war, no peace"", lasted until Poland demanded to re-establish diplomatic relations by issuing the ultimatum of 1938.[215] These tensions were one of the reasons that Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze federation was never formed.[181] The Soviets gave Vilnius to Lithuania after the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939.[221]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Lithuanian_War
Treaty of Hadiach,"The Treaty of Hadiach (Polish: Unia hadziacka; Ukrainian: гадяцький договір) was a treaty signed on 16 September 1658 in Hadiach between representatives of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Stanisław Kazimierz Bieniewski [pl] representing Poland and Kazimieras Liudvikas Jevlaševskis [lt] representing Lithuania) and Zaporozhian Cossacks (represented by Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky and starshina Yuri Nemyrych, the architect of the treaty, and Pavlo Teteria).

It was designed to elevate the Cossacks and Ruthenians to a position equal to that of Poland and Lithuania in the Polish–Lithuanian union and in fact transforming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth into a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth (Polish: Rzeczpospolita Trojga Narodów, lit. 'Republic of Three Nations', Lithuanian: Trijų Tautų Respublika, Belarusian: Рэч Паспалітая трох народаў, Ukrainian: Річ Посполита Трьох Народів).

A way to establish a Grand Principality of Ruthenia was considered by the Ukrainian hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky at various times,[1] particularly during the 1648 Cossack insurrection against Polish rule in the mainly ethnically-Ukrainian territories (see Khmelnytsky Uprising).

The list of points and humble requests that are submitted at his mercy by Serene Hetman of Zaporizhian Host along with the whole Zaporizhian Host and Ruthenian people to his royal mercy and the whole Rzeczpospolita:[2][3]

In May 1659 the Polish Diet (the Sejm) ratified the treaty with an amended text.[5] The plan, as envisioned by Yuri Nemyrych, would have ennobled some Cossacks, who would then run the Grand Principality of Ruthenia (1658). Hetman Ivan Vyhovsky could not get enough Cossacks to agree to keeping the Uniate Church, which the Catholic church refused to liquidate, but many Cossacks strongly opposed the idea.[6]

The plan meant an annulment of the Pereiaslav Agreement's arrangements and thus renewed hostilities between the Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia.[1]

The Treaty of Hadiach (Polish: ugoda hadziacka, Ukrainian: гадяцький договір) was a treaty signed on 16 September 1658 in Hadiach between the representatives of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Cossack Hetmanate. Its main goal was to create an equal position of Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians through the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth, a country of three nations.[7]

This decision, however, divided the Ukrainian Cossacks into pro-Russian and pro-Polish parties and led to the Ruin (Ukrainian history).

The concept of reconciliation between the Cossack Hetmanate and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was based on the principle of the confederal system of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth implemented at the Lublin Sejm in 1569.

According to the conditions proposed by the hetman Vyhovsky, Ukraine as an independent state called the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia was to join the confederation on equal terms with Poland and Lithuania. The territory of the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia consisted of the Kyiv, Bratslav and Chernihiv Voivodeships. The highest legislative power belonged to the national assembly of deputies, who were elected from all lands of the principality. Executive power was exercised by the hetman, who was elected for life and approved by the king. The selection of candidates for hetman was to be carried out jointly by all levels of Ukrainian society — the Cossacks, the nobility, and the clergy. The hetman headed the armed forces of Ukraine. In the Grand Duchy of Ruthenia, the state positions of chancellor, marshal, sub-treasury and the highest judicial tribunal were established.[7]

All paperwork was to be conducted in the Ruthenian language. In Kyiv or in another city, it was supposed to create a mint for minting one's own coin.

The Ukrainian army was to consist of 30,000 Cossacks and 10,000 troops hired by the hetman. The troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were forbidden to stay on the territory of the principality. In the event of hostilities in Ukraine, the troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which were on its territory, came under the command of the hetman. The rights and privileges of Cossacks were guaranteed. At the request of the hetman, one hundred Cossacks from each regiment were to be admitted to the nobility every year.

Orthodox believers were equal in rights with Catholics. The Greek Catholic Church was preserved, but could not spread to new territories. The Orthodox Metropolitan of Kyiv and five Orthodox bishops were to be given the right to sit in the common senate of the Commonwealth.[7]

The agreement provided for the consolidation of the academic status of the Kyiv–Mohyla Academy and equalization of its rights with the University of Kraków. On the territory of the principality, it was planned to establish another Orthodox academy and secondary educational institutions — collegiums, as well as to fund the required number of primary schools and printing houses.[7]

Generally speaking, the treaty was unsuccessful. From the point of view of the politics of the Cossack Hetmanate, the terms of the treaty drafted by the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were a step back compared to the terms offered to the Cossacks by Moscow four years ago. Instead of a de facto independent state under the protection of a foreign ruler, the Cossack state, now called the Duchy of Ruthenia, became a component of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, integrated into its administrative and territorial system. Its territory was divided into three voivodeships. The hetman had no right to diplomatic relations with foreign rulers. The Ukrainian Cossack army was reduced from 60 to 30 thousand. The Cossacks lost the right to elect the hetman, which now passed to the foreman. Moreover, the granting of nobility to a limited circle of Cossack elders deprived the common Cossacks of their own elite. Such conditions were significantly inferior to the proposed and largely implemented conditions of the Treaty of Pereiaslav in 1654.

After the Russo–Polish War (1654–1667), Ukraine was divided into the Right Bank, which remained part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth until its Second Partition in 1793, and the Left Bank, which, together with Kyiv on the Right Bank, became part of the Tsardom of Russia.[8]

The idea of a Ruthenian Duchy within the Commonwealth was completely abandoned in 1659 after the second Agreement.[1][9] The Canadian historian Paul Robert Magosci believes that happened because of the divisions among the Cossacks and because of the Russian invasion.[10] However, those events were much earlier than the signing of the Treaty of Hadiach. The Russian historian Tairova-Yakovleva regards the resistance of Polish society and papal pressure as the reasons for the failure in ratification.

The historian Andrew Wilson has called it ""one of the great 'What-ifs?' of Ukrainian and East European history"". He notes:

""If it had been successfully implemented, the Commonwealth would finally have become a loose confederation of Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians. The missing Ukrainian buffer state would have come into being as the Commonwealth's eastern pillar. Russian expansion might have been checked and Poland spared the agonies of the Partitions or, perhaps just as likely, it might have struggled on longer as the 'Sick man of Europe'"" (p. 65).

In spite of considerable opposition by the Roman Catholic clergy, the Treaty of Hadiach was approved by Polish king and the Sejm on 22 May 1659 but with an amended text.[11] The idea of a Ruthenian Duchy within the Commonwealth was completely abandoned.[12] It was a Commonwealth attempt to regain influence over the Ukrainian territories, which had been lost after the series of Cossack uprisings (like the Khmelnytsky Uprising) and growing influence of Russia over the Cossacks (like the 1654 Pereiaslav Agreement).

Hetman Vyhovsky supported the negotiations with the Commonwealth, especially after he suppressed a revolt led by the colonel of Poltava, Martyn Pushkar, and severed relations with Tsardom of Russia for its violations of the Pereiaslav Agreement of 1654.[13] The Treaty of Hadiach was, however, viewed by many Cossacks as ""too little, too late"", and they especially opposed the agreement to return the land property to the szlachta. After the 1648 revolt, the Commonwealth was very unpopular with ordinary Cossacks. Rank-and-file Cossacks saw the Orthodox Tsardom of Russia as their natural ally and did not care for an alliance with the overwhelmingly-Catholic Commonwealth[citation needed]. Furthermore, Hadiach was too much a deal that merely benefited the elite of the Cossacks, the starshyna, who wanted to be recognized as equal to the Polish nobility. Thus, while some Cossacks, among them the hetman Ivan Vyhovsky supported the Commonwealth, many opposed it, and Cossack unrest continued in Ukraine.[14][failed verification]

The Commonwealth position was further weakened by a string of losses in the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). The Tsar felt threatened by the Treaty of Hadiach, which weakened his hold on Cossacks. The Russians saw the treaty as an act of war and, even before its ratification, sent an army into Ukraine. Although Polish-Lithuanian forces under Stefan Czarniecki dealt a defeat to Russian forces at the Battle of Polonka and recaptured Vilnius in 1660, the lack of other Commonwealth military successes, especially in Ukraine, further undermined Cossack support of the Commonwealth. Vyhovsky's early success at the Battle of Konotop in June 1659 was not decisive enough and was followed by a series of defeats. The Russian garrisons in Ukraine continued to hold out; a Zaporozhian attack on the Crimean Khanate forced Vyhovsky's Tatar allies to return home, and unrest broke out in the Poltava region. Finally, several pro-Russian colonels rebelled and accused Vyhovsky of ""selling Ukraine out to the Poles"".

Unable to continue the war, Vyhovsky resigned in October 1659 and retired to Poland. The situation was further complicated by the Ottoman Empire, which tried to gain control of the disputed region and played all factions against one another. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth was weakened by Lubomirski's rebellion. The treaty was mostly repeated in the 1660 Treaty of Chudnov.

In the end, Russia was victorious, as seen in the 1667 Truce of Andrusovo and the Treaty of Perpetual Peace (1686). Ukrainian Cossacks fell under the Russian sphere of influence, with much fewer privileges under the Hetmanate than would have been granted under the Treaty of Hadiach. By the late 18th century, Cossack political influence was almost destroyed by the Russian Empire.

In the aftermath of the November Uprising in 1831, there was an attempt to recreate the Treaty of Hadiach to form a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth to throw off the partitions of Poland. It was then that the coat of arms of the proposed Commonwealth was created. The planned convention in Hadiach was declared illegal by the Russians, who stationed close to 2,000 soldiers there to ensure that no meetings or demonstrations took place, and they blocked passage through nearby bridges. Despite the precautions, a mass and a celebration involving 15–20,000 people and over 200 priests (both Catholic and Orthodox) took place near Hadiach.

The idea of a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth revived during the January Uprising when a patriotic demonstration took place at Horodło in 1861. The so-called Second Union of Horodło was announced there by the szlachta of Congress Poland of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania of Volhynia and of Podolia. The New Commonwealth, based on the Second Union of Horodło, was to be based on the three nations, and its proposed coat of arms included the Polish eagle, the Lithuanian Pahonia, and the patron saint of Ruthenia, the Archangel Michael.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Hadiach
Name of Lithuania,"The first known record of the name of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuva) was recorded in the Quedlinburg Chronicle (Latin: Annales Quedlinburgenses, written between 1008 and 1030) in a 9 March 1009 story of Saint Bruno.[1] The Chronicle recorded in the form Litua  (in the phrase ""in confinio Rusciæ et Lituæ a paganis capite plexus""). Although it is clear the name originated from a Baltic language,[2] scholars still debate the meaning of the word.[3]

During the 13th century the Duchy of Lithuania was bordered by Slavic lands. The Slavs did not create the name; they used the existing Lithuanian ethnonym.[3] The Lithuanian diphthong -ie- has, in Slavic languages, shifted to the vowel -i- (и), and the short -u- became extra-short (reduced) -ŭ- (ъ) which, being unstressed, later disappeared from the East Slavic, hence Litva. This is evidence that the Slavs borrowed this ethnonym from Lithuanians a long time ago.[4][3][vague]

During the next century, Lithuania's name was recorded in other languages, including German and Polish. In early German chronicles Lithuania's name was spelled Lettowen.[5][3] In this form the German letter -e- is used to denote the Lithuanian diphthong -ie-, while -owen denotes the Lithuanian hydronymic suffix -uva (-ava).[5][3] The traditional Lithuanian root -liet- is encountered in various German terms of the era, such as Lettowen, and in Latin as Lethovia, Lettovia, Lettavia, etc.[3] For example, after becoming the ruler of Lithuania, Grand Duke Algirdas appeared as the King of Lithuania (Latin: rex Letwinorum) in the Livonian Chronicles.[6][7]

In the Rus' chronicles,[which?] Lithuania's name was written as Литъва, alongside a shortened version, Литва (Litva), where -i- (и) was already used instead of the diphthong -ie.[3] All of these names clearly originated from *Lētuvā > Lietuva, forms used by Lithuanians to identify their lands.[4][3] The current form of the name Lietuva is thought to have been used by Lithuanians since the 12th or 13th century,[8] but there are no written sources of that time, as the oldest existing manuscript in the Lithuanian language is dated back to the 16th century. Despite ample historic and linguistic evidence with regard to the name's usage in different languages, there is a certain degree of debate about the etymology of the name.[3]

The regalia of Grand Duke Gediminas did not survive; however, it is known that in 1323 Gediminas sent 7 letters from his castle in Vilnius that also did not survive. Therefore, with them the Seal of Gediminas was also lost.[9] Nevertheless, the letter's content is known from a transcript as on 1 July 1323 notary (John of Bremen) in the city of Lübeck confirmed a transcript of a 26 May 1323 letter of Gediminas and also described in detail the oval waxy seal which was attached to the letter.[10][9] According to the notary's transcript, the oval Seal of Gediminas had a twelve corners edging, at the middle of the edging was an image of a man with long hair, who sat on a throne and held a crown (or a wreath) in his right hand and a sceptre in his left hand, moreover, a cross was engraved around the man along with a Latin inscription: S DEI GRACIA GEDEMINNI LETHWINOR ET RUTKENOR REG (English: Gediminas', by the grace of God, the King of the Lithuanians and the Rus' people, seal).[10][9][11] Authentic Jogaila's seal from 1382 has a Latin text: ✶ ia ‚ gal ✶ – dey ✶ gracia ✶ r – ex – in ✶ lettow (English: Jogaila, by the grace of God, King in Lithuania).[6]

Following the Union of Lublin, the Lithuanians and Grand Dukes of Lithuania also called the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the Lithuanian Republic and considered it a separate entity from the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland.[12]

In a Lithuanian language panegyric to Sigismund III Vasa in 1589, the genitive case of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania is Lietuwos.[13] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania is referred to as dides Kunigiſtes Lietuwos in Lithuanian within a religious Christian book from 1653.[14]

There have been several attempts to associate Lietuva with Celtic toponyms, and with Latin or Italian words, but these attempts all lack strong linguistic support. According to a widespread popular belief, the word Lietuva (Lithuania) originated from the Lithuanian words lyti (to rain) and lietus (rain).[15][16][3] However, there is no serious scientific support for this theory. Since the word Lietuva has a suffix (-uva), the original word should have no suffix.[3] A likely candidate is Lietā.[3] Because many Baltic ethnonyms originated from hydronyms, linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms. Usually such names evolved through the following process: hydronym → toponym → ethnonym.[17][3]

A small river not far from Kernavė, the core area of the early Lithuanian state and a possible first capital of the would-be Grand Duchy of Lithuania, is usually credited as the source of the name.[3] This river's original name is Lietava.[17][3] As time passed, the suffix -ava could have changed into -uva, as the two are from the same suffix branch.[3] The river flows in the lowlands and easily spills over its banks, therefore the traditional Lithuanian form liet- could be directly translated as lietis (to spill), of the root derived from the Proto-Indo-European *leyǝ-.[18][3] However, the river is very small and some find it improbable that such a small and local object could have lent its name to an entire nation. On the other hand, such a fact is not unprecedented in world history.[4]

While the word's etymology continues to be debated, scientists agree that the primary origins of the ethnonym were the Lithuanian forms *Lētuvā/Lietuva, which were then used by different languages, including Slavic.[3] It is very unlikely for the name to have derived from a Slavic language, since the Slavic -i- (и) could never be transliterated into the Lithuanian diphthong -ie-.[4][3]

Among other etymologies of the name of Lithuania is Artūras Dubonis's hypothesis,[19] that Lietuva relates to the word *leičiai (plural of leitis, a social group in the early Grand Duchy of Lithuania).[20][21][22][23][24][25] The word leičiai is still used as an ethnonym for Lithuanians, usually poetically or in historical contexts, in the Latvian language, which is closely related to Lithuanian.[25][23]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Lithuania

Sigismund I the Old,"Sigismund I the Old (Polish: Zygmunt I Stary, Lithuanian: Žygimantas I Senasis; 1 January 1467 – 1 April 1548) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1506 until his death in 1548. Sigismund I was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the son of Casimir IV and younger brother of Kings John I Albert and Alexander I Jagiellon. He was nicknamed ""the Old"" in later historiography to distinguish him from his son and successor, Sigismund II Augustus. Before ascending to the Polish and Lithuanian thrones, he was Duke of Głogów from 1499, Duke of Opava from 1501, and governor of Silesia from 1504 on behalf of his brother, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary.

Sigismund was born in the town of Kozienice in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife Elizabeth of Austria. He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father. Sigismund's eldest brother and rightful heir Vladislaus II instead became the King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia as the successor to George of Poděbrady in Bohemia and then to Matthias Corvinus in Hungary, thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms. When Casimir died, the Polish-Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons, with John Albert being crowned King of Poland, and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert's sudden death in 1501. Hence, Sigismund's reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39.

A capable monarch and a patron of arts, Sigismund established Polish rule over Ducal Prussia and annexed the Duchy of Mazovia with Warsaw, while retaining the nation's wealth and prominence in the region. He made sure that his nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, and Albert's Protestant successors would pay feudal homage or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence. This was observed until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1657 when Prussia gained its sovereignty. Sigismund and his commander Jan Amor Tarnowski also defeated Moldavia at Obertyn in 1531, and Muscovy in 1535, thereby strengthening the country's eastern borders. His 42-year reign was further marked by decisive contributions to Polish architecture, cuisine, language, and customs, especially at the behest of his second wife, the Italian-born Bona Sforza. Italian styles and fashions dominated at the height of the Polish Renaissance and Polish Golden Age, which developed the Catholic identity of Poland. He was commemorated on a contemporary 200-złoty banknote.

Sigismund was married twice, first to noblewoman Barbara Zápolya from Hungary and then to Bona Sforza, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan.[1] Their only surviving son and the last Jagiellon king, Sigismund Augustus, was made his co-kingvivente rege in 1529 and formally assumed throne when Sigismund the Old died in 1548.[2]

Sigismund was the son of King Casimir IV Jagiellon and Elisabeth Habsburg of Austria.[1] He followed his brothers John Albert and Alexander to the Polish throne.[3] Their eldest brother Vladislaus became king of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia. Sigismund was christened as the namesake of his maternal great-grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund.

When Casimir died in 1492, Sigismund was his only son without any titles or land. From 1495 to 1496, he petitioned his brother Alexander to provide him with land, and Elisabeth of Austria attempted to install him on the Austrian throne. Both efforts failed. In 1497, King John I Albert, his older brother, led an invasion of Moldavia that was intended to place Sigismund on its throne. This, too, was a disastrous failure. Finally, his eldest brother Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, granted him the duchies of Głogów (1499) and Opava (1501), and in 1504 Sigismund became governor of Silesia and Lower Lusatia.[4]

John I Albert died suddenly in 1501, and was succeeded by Alexander I, who died in 1506. After his death, Sigismund arrived in Vilnius, where he was elected by the Lithuanian Ducal Council on 13 September 1506 as Grand Duke of Lithuania, contrary to the Union of Mielnik (1501), which proposed a joint Polish-Lithuanian election of a monarch. On 8 December 1506, during the session of the Polish Senate in Piotrków, Sigismund was elected King of Poland. He arrived in Kraków on 20 January 1507 and was crowned four days later in Wawel Cathedral by Primate Andrzej Boryszewski.[5][6]

The internal situation in Poland was characterised by broad authorisation of the Chamber of Deputies, confirmed and extended in the constitution of Nihil novi. During Alexander's reign, the law of Nihil novi had been instituted, which forbade kings of Poland from enacting laws without the consent of the Sejm. Sigismund had little control over the act, unlike the senators, whom he personally appointed. Eventually, during his reign, Sigismund benefited from the advice of the local nobility, competent ministers in charge of the royal judiciary system, and the wealthy influential treasurers of Kraków. Although he was reluctant to the parliamentary system and political independence of the nobility, he recognised the authority of legal norms, supported legalism and summoned annual sessions of the Sejm, usually obtaining funds on state defence. However he was unsuccessful at attempting to create a permanent fund for defence from the annual income tax. Despite this, in 1527 he established a conscript army and the bureaucracy needed to finance it. He set up the legal codes that formalised serfdom in Poland, placing the peasants into the private estates of nobles.[7]

Likely related to tax matters was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the king, made on 5 May 1523. The identity of the would-be assassin - who shot the ruler while he was strolling in the evening around the cloisters of the Wawel castle - and his potential supporters was never established. Unclear motives remained after the assassination attempt. Three weeks before the event, Sigismund I introduced a new edict that was very unfavourable and somewhat hostile to the high-ranking nobles and their interests.

Sigismund I achieved several economic successes, including partial debt reduction, separation of accounts of public taxation from the royal treasury, strengthening of the activities of the mint operating in Kraków, and the attempt to organise the processing of income from operating salt mines.[8] Furthermore, he issued a statute for the Armenians (1519) and strongly intended to harmonise the judicial system across the country.[9]

Between 1530 and 1538 the king issued two statutes defining the rules for the selection of the monarch, which permanently established the election viritim. The laws held that all social groups, regardless of their wealth, could watch the election process (unusquisque qui vellet), and the election was to be free (electio Regis libera).

Sigismund successfully organised the agricultural economy, looked after the development of the royal cities and recovered numerous goods of the treasury belonging to the crown that were under lien. During the financial activities, the King received full support of his wife, Queen Bona, who aimed to expand the royal estates by purchasing and improving economic efficiency. In 1514 he set up the Council of Four Lands and put Abraham of Bohemia in charge of it.[10]

At the start of his reign, King Sigismund I the Old inherited a Kingdom of Poland with a century-long tradition of liberties of the nobility, confirmed in numerous privileges. A rebellion in Lwów widely known as the Chicken War (Polish: Wojna kokosza) was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist rokosz (revolt) by the Polish nobility that occurred in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the ""war's"" only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lwów in eastern part of Lesser Poland.[11]

To strengthen his power, Sigismund initiated a set of reforms, establishing a permanent conscription army in 1527 and extending the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to govern the state and finance the army. Supported by his Italian consort Bona Sforza, he began buying up land and issue agriculture reformas to enlarge the royal treasury. He initiated a process of restitution of royal properties, previously pawned or rented to the nobles.

The nobility gathered near the city to meet to a levée en masse and called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility organised a revolt to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the tithe, confirmation and extension of privileges for nobles and adoption of a law concerning Incompatibilitas — an individual wouldn't be able to hold two or more official administrative positions in the country. The role of the Incompatibilitas was to prevent wealthy magnates from usurping too much power at the expense of lesser nobles.

However, the revolt soon transpired that the nobility's leaders were divided and that achieving a settlement was almost impossible. Too weak to start a civil war against the King, the protesters finally agreed to what was thought a compromise. Sigismund rejected most of their demands, while accepting the principle of Incompatibilitas the following year and agreeing not to force the election of the future king in vivente rege. Thereupon, the nobility returned to their homes having achieved little.

Sigismund was intermittently at war with Vasili III of Muscovy beginning in 1507, before the Polish army was fully under his command. Further tensions escalated when Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was bribing Khan Meñli I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[12] In December 1512, Muscovite forces marched into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture Smolensk, a major trading center between Russia and Europe.[13] The initial six- and four-week sieges in 1513 were a failure,[14] but the city fell to the Muscovites in July 1514.[12]

Russia subsequently suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the field. In 1512, Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Konstanty Ostrogski, ransacked the region of Severia and vanquished a Russian force of approximately 6,000 men. On 8 September 1514, Muscovy suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Orsha, which prevented the Russians to place all the former Kievan Rus' lands under their lordship.[15] Poland exploited the battle for propaganda purposes with strong anti-Russian sentiment. A letter sent to Rome stated that ""Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom"".[16]
Regardless of victory, the Polish–Lithuanian troops were incapable of moving quickly enough to retake Smolensk.[17] In 1518, Russian forces were again beaten during the siege of Polotsk,[18] when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their patron saint, Saint Casimir, the older brother of Sigismund. However, this was dubbed by historians as a folk tale. In 1522, a truce was signed between Lithuania and Muscovy which extended until 1534.

In 1534, when Grand Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł and the Tatars pillaged western Russia, the Muscovites in retaliation invaded Lithuania once more. They were eventually stopped by Polish commander Jan Amor Tarnowski and allies at Starodub in 1535.[19] Their defeat strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union's eastern flank until the beginning of the Livonian War in 1558.[19]

In 1515 Sigismund entered into an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. In return for Maximilian lending weight to the provisions of the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), Sigismund consented to the marriage of the children of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, his brother, to the grandchildren of Maximilian. Through this double marriage contract, Bohemia and Hungary passed to the House of Habsburg in 1526, on the death of Sigismund's nephew, Louis II, who led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in the disastrous Battle of Mohács.

Worried about the growing ties between the Habsburgs and Russia, in 1524 Sigismund signed a Franco-Polish alliance with King Francis I of France to avoid a possible war on two fronts.[20] Francis I himself was looking for allies in Central Europe to curtail the increasing power of Habsburg Emperor Charles V, whose realms were labelled ""the empire on which the sun never sets"".[21] Furthermore, Queen Bona was instrumental in establishing an alliance between Poland and France, with the objective of recovering Milan.[20] The official negotiations were conducted by Antonio Rincon in 1524, who was then followed by Jerome Laski.[21] Through the agreement, the son of Francis, Henry, Duke of Orléans, was to marry one of Sigismund's daughters, and Sigismund's eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I.[21]

The negotiations came to an end and the alliance was disbanded when Francis' troops were defeated by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525.[21] Disturbed by the failure of his campaign, Francis turned to Hungary instead and formed a Franco-Hungarian alliance with King John Zápolya in 1528.[21]

After the death of Janusz III of Masovia in 1526, Sigismund succeeded in uniting the Duchy of Masovia and Warsaw with the Kingdom of Poland. There was speculation whether Janusz and his younger brother Stanisław were poisoned by a subject of Queen Bona.[22][23] The accusations were so pervasive and rampant that Sigismund ordered an investigation, as a result of which a special edict was declared on 9 February 1528 confirming that the Masovian princes died naturally or due to related illness. According to chronicler Jan Długosz, the real cause of the death of both princes could have been inherited tuberculosis.[24]

In other matters of policy, Sigismund sought peaceful coexistence with the Khanate of Crimea, but was unable to completely end border skirmishes.[25]

Over two centuries of wars against the Teutonic Knights ended in 1525 with the Treaty of Kraków after the final Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521).[26] Previously, the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) placed the Teutonic Order under Polish suzerainty and interfered with German interests in Livonia, Pomerania, Warmia and Masuria. The Order attempted to avoid paying tribute to Polish monarchs which was a demonstration of weakness and dependence.

In accordance with the new Treaty of Kraków, the Order was abruptly secularized and turned de facto into a puppet state of Poland which lasted until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1655. Sigismund's nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, converted to Lutheranism under the persuasion of Martin Luther, and paid a feudal homage to Sigismund.[27] In return he was granted the domains of the Order as the First Duke of Prussia. This became known in Polish and Lithuanian history as the ""Prussian Homage"", which was often featured in arts. The Prussian Landtag and parliament assembled in Königsberg, where envoys embraced both the new Duke and the Protestant Reformation. Thereupon, the Teutonic Order lost its importance as a military order in Prussia and retreated to the Holy Roman Empire where it became secluded.[26]

Sigismund had a profound interest in Renaissance humanism and the revival of classical antiquity. His second consort Bona Sforza, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, was also instrumental in developing the Polish Renaissance and brought renowned Italian artists, architects and sculptors from her native country. It was under Sigismund's reign that Renaissance began to flourish in Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sigismund II Augustus later continued his father's legacy.

Among the illustrious figures that guested or lived in Poland at the time were Bartholommeo Berecci, Francesco Fiorentino, Santi and Mateo Gucci, Bernardo Morando, Giovanni Battista di Quadro and Hans Dürer. Most of the decorators working for the court were foreigners, especially Italians and Germans who had a profound impact on Poland's architecture as a whole.[28] The centrepiece of their work is Wawel Castle in Kraków, the seat of Polish monarchs as well as one of the largest castles in Central Europe. Situated on a hill overlooking Old Town, the fortified residence was extensively reconstructed in the Renaissance style and to the personal needs of the royal family. The Italian cloistered courtyard in the shape of a quadrangle, corridors, archways and portals were designed by Fiorentino with the help of Benedykt from Sandomierz. A similar design was undertaken in Niepołomice Castle, the hunting retreat of the Jagiellons.[29]

The most prominent example of Sigismund's architectural legacy is a funerary monument in the form of a chapel at Wawel Cathedral. It was constructed between 1519 and 1533 according to plans by Bartolomeo Berrecci of Florence, and serves as a mausoleum of the last Jagiellons.[30] The exterior dome is gold-plated and interior tombs made of marble were designed by Santi Gucci.[30] Historians, experts and architects unanimously voted the chapel as ""the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps"".[31][32] The monarch also commissioned a 12.6-tonne bell which was named in his honour. The Royal Sigismund Bell was installed 13 July 1521 on Wawel Cathedral's northernmost tower. Apart from religious and national holidays, the bell rung on some of the most significant moments in Polish history and is one of Poland's national symbols.[33]

Sigismund suffered from numerous illnesses and diseases, especially towards the end of his life. Most notably, he was tormented by constant fevers since youth as well as gout and acute rheumatism in the autumn of 1528.[34][35] The condition, which severely affected his joints and right leg, was repetitive and continued in 1529 and 1534. It is likely that Sigismund Augustus was co-crowned vivente rege in 1529 as a result of these pervasive pains and in case his father died unexpectedly.[36] Furthermore, bad eating habits and a poor diet contributed to the king's ailing health, in particular large amounts of beer and mead.[34] Eventually, the king's inability to walk forced him to be carried in a litter. However, despite his age, Sigismund was of sound mind throughout and remained active in politics until death.[35] In 1543, he recovered from an influenza which spread in Kraków and in 1545 he enjoyed a last hunting excursion to Niepołomice.[36]

Sigismund died on 1 April 1548, Easter day at the age of 81 and was buried on 7 July at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, Sigismund II Augustus, who became the last Jagiellon king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1587 Sigismund the Old's grandson, Sigismund III from the House of Vasa, was elected King of Poland. He was the son of Catherine Jagiellon and her husband John III Vasa of Sweden. Hence, Sigismund III could not belong to the Jagiellonian dynasty by his mother, but the Jagiellon bloodline of Polish monarchs continued until the death of Sigismund Vasa's second son John II Casimir.

In 1512, Sigismund married Barbara Zápolya (d. 1515),[1] a Hungarian noblewoman, with whom he had two daughters:

In 1517, Sigismund married Bona Sforza,[38] with whom he had two sons and four daughters:

They compete domestically in the Lithuanian Basketball League (Lietuvos krepšinio lyga) and internationally as a long-term licensed EuroLeague team. Since the 2011–12 season, Žalgiris has played its home games in Žalgiris Arena in the New Town district of Kaunas.

Žalgiris is the most decorated basketball club in the country, having won 24 Lithuanian Basketball League championships, five Soviet Union National League championships (the second most behind CSKA Moscow), and one EuroLeague championship. Many Lithuanian basketball legends have played for Žalgiris throughout the club's history, including Arvydas Sabonis, Modestas Paulauskas, and Šarūnas Jasikevičius. Eight of the fifteen Lithuanian basketball players to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) have played for Žalgiris or were part of the Žalgiris youth program at one point in their careers (Arvydas Sabonis, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Donatas Motiejūnas, Mindaugas Kuzminskas, Darius Songaila, Martynas Andriuškevičius, Arnoldas Kulboka, and Ignas Brazdeikis).

The club's name commemorates the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War's Battle of Žalgiris, also known as the Battle of Grunwald, in which the joint forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland defeated the Teutonic Order in one of medieval Europe's largest battles. Žalgiris and Grunwald translate to ""green wood"" in Lithuanian and German, respectively.

BC Žalgiris was formed in 1944. In 1944 they played against the Nazi German basketball team.[2] The team was named ASK from 1945 to 1947, after which it was named SKIF from 1947 to 1949. Beginning in 1950, the team was renamed Žalgiris. The team quickly rose to prominence, winning the Soviet Union's top-tier USSR Premier Basketball League twice, in 1947 and 1951,[3] as well as multiple domestic Lithuanian championships. In the following years, the team won two silver medals in the USSR league in 1949 and 1952, and four bronze medals from 1953 to 1956. Žalgiris also won the USSR Basketball Cup in 1953. The team at the time was led by Stepas Butautas, Vytautas Kulakauskas, Justinas Lagunavičius, Kazimieras Petkevičius, and later, by Stasys Stonkus and Algirdas Lauritėnas. In the 1960s, the team's play declined, and many new young players joined the team, such as Modestas Paulauskas, Romualdas Venzbergas, Henrikas Giedraitis, Algirdas Linkevičius and Sergejus Jovaiša.

Žalgiris became the dominant club in the Soviet Union and Europe when they added Valdemaras Chomičius and Rimas Kurtinaitis to their roster, along with coach Vladas Garastas. The team won bronze medals in the Soviet Union championship in 1971, 1973, and 1978.[4] In 1980, Žalgiris debuted in the 1980–81 FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. Their biggest addition, though, was 17-year-old Arvydas Sabonis, who debuted with the club in 1981 at 209 centimetres (82 in) and grew another 12 centimetres (4.7 in) in the next couple years. Sabonis soon became known for his versatility, being able to play defense, assist his teammates, shoot three-pointers, and dominate inside the paint.

From 1985 to 1987, Žalgiris won three consecutive Soviet Union National League championships, beating CSKA Moscow (English: Central Sports Club of Army) in the finals in all three years.[5] In 1985, they reached the Saporta Cup final, but lost to FC Barcelona. Despite the loss, Žalgiris participated in EuroLeague the next year as the Soviet Union champions, reaching the finals and losing to rival KK Cibona. Žalgiris was emerging as one of the top clubs in Europe at the time.

In the mid-1980s, the rivalry between Žalgiris Kaunas and CSKA Moscow served as a major inspiration for the Lithuanian national revival, especially when they played in Kaunas Sports Hall. It contributed to the emergence of the Sąjūdis national movement and the re-establishment of state independence.[6] In 1987, however, Žalgiris suffered a setback when star player Sabonis suffered a torn achilles tendon. Three months later, he tore it again, causing him to miss most of the 1987–88 season.[7] That season, Žalgiris won a silver medal, losing to CSKA Moscow in the Soviet League finals. The next season, Žalgiris managed to reach the European Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals and won a silver medal in the Soviet league, losing a dramatic finals to Stroitel Kiev.

Just before the start of the 1989–90 season, Žalgiris lost Sabonis, Kurtinaitis, Jovaiša, Chomičius, and head coach Garastas, as the Iron Curtain, which had barred Lithuanian basketball talent from becoming internationally sought-after, had been lifted.[8] In the 1989–90 season, Žalgiris reached the Clubs Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals, where they lost to Real Madrid.

After the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, Žalgiris left the USSR championship. Over the next few seasons, Žalgiris won Lithuanian championships in 1991, 1992, and 1993, and the LKF Cup in 1990. They won their first LKL title in 1994, beating Atletas Kaunas 3–1 in a four-game series. Over the following two years, Žalgiris again dominated LKL tournaments, beating Atletas Kaunas 3–0 in 1995 and 3–2 (after being down 0–2 in the series) in 1996, however, European success lacked the team, as Žalgiris struggled in both the FIBA European League and FIBA European Cup qualifications. In 1996, Žalgiris finally found success participating in the 1995–96 FIBA European Cup when Rimas Kurtinaitis returned to play for his home team - Žalgiris managed to reach the semifinals, though succumbed to the powerful PAOK Thessaloniki in a two game series. In 1997, Žalgiris again won the LKL championship, beating Žemaitijos Olimpas 3–0 in the finals, and reaching round 16 in the Saporta Cup, losing to Paris Basket Racing. Players such as Darius Lukminas, Gintaras Einikis, Kęstutis Šeštokas, Dainius Adomaitis, and Darius Maskoliūnas played for the club during this period, coached by Jonas Kazlauskas.

Žalgiris enjoyed its greatest success as a club during the 1997–98 and 1998–99 seasons. They were coached by Jonas Kazlauskas with a new generation of Lithuanian talent, including Saulius Štombergas, Dainius Adomaitis, Eurelijus Žukauskas, Tomas Masiulis, and Mindaugas Žukauskas, and experienced foreign players Franjo Arapović and Ennis Whatley. The team defeated Stefanel Milano 82–67 in the 1998 FIBA Saporta Cup final in Belgrade. Saulius Štombergas scored 35 points in the final. Žalgiris also won a fifth-consecutive LKL title, this time against Atletas Kaunas.

In the 1998–99 season, Žalgiris made it to the EuroLeague Final Four for the first time in the club's history, and were crowned champions after defeating Olympiacos and Kinder Bologna in the semi-final and the final, respectively. Tyus Edney was named EuroLeague Final Four MVP. Žalgiris also won LKL and North European Basketball League (NEBL) titles that season.

The year after winning the EuroLeague, Žalgiris suffered one of its worst seasons. The club was eliminated after the group stage in the EuroLeague, finishing third in the NEBL and losing the LKL finals to Lietuvos Rytas for the first time.[9] In the 2000–01 season, the team reached the new EuroLeague playoffs, but lost to AEK. Žalgiris won the LKL championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas 3–2. The 2001–02 season was again disappointing, as the team was eliminated in the EuroLeague after the group stage and lost the LKL championship to Lietuvos Rytas. In the 2002–03 season, they were again eliminated in the EuroLeague playoffs, but achieved the LKL championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas 4–2.

Sabonis became the principal owner of the club in 2003, after playing for many years in the Spanish ACB League and the North American National Basketball Association (NBA). He also played for the club during the 2003–04 season,[10] winning EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16 MVP. Žalgiris almost made it to the EuroLeague Final Four, but were stopped by Maccabi Tel Aviv, who tied the game with Derrick Sharp's last-second three-pointer at the end of regulation and went on to beat Žalgiris in overtime.[11] The season ended on a high note, as Žalgiris swept Lietuvos Rytas 4–0 in the LKL championship.

After the departure of Sabonis at the conclusion of the 2003–04 season, Žalgiris faced a series of ups and downs.[12] In the 2004–05 season, mainstays Tanoka Beard, Mindaugas Timinskas, Dainius Šalenga, and new addition Robert Pack enabled Žalgiris to have a respectable season.[13] In the EuroLeague, Žalgiris finished the regular season with an 8–6 record, including wins on the road against heavy favorites Maccabi Tel Aviv and FC Barcelona. However, in the Top 16 phase, the team entered a long slump and finished with an 0–6 record.[14] Žalgiris recovered on the domestic front, easily defeating ULEB Cup winner Lietuvos Rytas in the LKL finals with a 4–0 sweep, and also won the inaugural Baltic Basketball League (BBL) championship, beating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals 64–60.[15][16]

In the 2005–06 season, the team suffered many changes. Mindaugas Timinskas, Dainius Šalenga, and Robert Pack all departed the team, so Žalgiris built a younger team while signing Ed Cota to return. With the emergence of Darjuš Lavrinovič, Žalgiris started the season solidly, finishing the EuroLeague regular season with a 9–5 record.[17] Off-court, Žalgiris had many issues, resulting in a huge slump for the team. They ended the top-16 phase with another 0–6 record and lost both the LKL and BBL titles to Lietuvos Rytas.[18][19] The lone bright spot became the play of emerging point guard Mantas Kalnietis, who was signed both as a replacement for the released Cota and due to very poor play from new point guard and longtime NBA player Kenny Anderson.[20][21][22]

Žalgiris had a new coach for the 2006–07 season, Ainars Bagatskis, but suffered a terrible EuroLeague regular season. After Ainars Bagatskis was replaced by assistant coach Rimantas Grigas and the signing of new point guard DeJuan Collins, Žalgiris won the newly established LKF Cup by beating Lietuvos Rytas. Žalgiris also beat Lietuvos Rytas in the LKL finals.

Before the 2007–08 season, Žalgiris signed longtime EuroLeague player Marcus Brown. Žalgiris also played against NBA teams for the first time. The team had a successful regular season in the EuroLeague, finishing with an 8–6 record, but suffered another disappointment in the top 16, finishing with a 1–5 record. Žalgiris also won the LKF Cup for the second consecutive year, beating Lietuvos Rytas 83–72 in the finals.[citation needed] In the BBL finals, Žalgiris defeated Lietuvos Rytas 86–84 in the finals on a last-second shot by Collins. Žalgiris retained the LKL title, beating Lietuvos Rytas 4–1 in the LKL finals in which Brown was named MVP.

The 2008–09 season started on a very high note, with contract extensions for Jonas Mačiulis and Loren Woods, retaining leader Marcus Brown, and the signing of new point guard Willie Deane, who replaced the departed DeJuan Collins.[23] However, financial difficulties lead to poor play from the team and the firing of coach Grigas, who was replaced by longtime player and assistant coach Gintaras Krapikas.[24] Willie Deane was soon released, in large part due to his poor performance in the EuroLeague, which led to a seven-game losing streak.[25] The team recovered under point guard Mantas Kalnietis, and finished the EuroLeague regular season with a 2–8 record, missing the top 16.[26] Despite growing financial difficulties, and the departure of Loren Woods, the team made the LKL and BBL finals, as well as the LKF Cup finals.[27] Despite this, this was the most Žalgiris could accomplish, as they lost to Lietuvos Rytas.[28][29] Jonas Mačiulis, who became the team leader during the season, left after the season ended.[30]

During the 2008–09 season, Žalgiris faced significant financial difficulties. In 2009, Sabonis sold most of his stake to the local Ūkio banko investment group (ŪBIG), headed by Vladimir Romanov, who ended up controlling a 75% stake in the club. Sabonis retained 21.5% ownership of the club, 3% was owned by a minority group, and 0.5% was owned by the Kaunas municipality.[31]

In the 2009–10 season, Romanov became unpopular among Žalgiris fans. After the departures of Jonas Mačiulis and Paulius Jankūnas, the team extended the contract of Marcus Brown and also signed Martynas Pocius, who quickly became one of the best players on the team.[32] The team also re-signed point guard Mantas Kalnietis, who turned down an offer from Benetton Treviso.[33][34] The team started the season by winning the new BBL Cup against Lietuvos Rytas. However, subsequent poor performances led to head coach Krapikas being replaced by former Lithuanian national team coach Ramūnas Butautas, who led the team to the EuroLeague Top-16 phase with a 3–7 regular season record. After the team entered a slump, Romanov controversially fired Butautas, replacing him with assistant coach and former captain Darius Maskoliūnas. Under Maskoliūnas, Žalgiris came its closest to the EuroLeague Top-8 phase, finishing with a 2–4 record.[35] Žalgiris won back the BBL title by beating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals, but lost the LKL finals to Rytas by 4–3. Romanov fired coach Maskoliūnas during this series, leading to speculation that Romanov had intentionally lost the finals to allow Lietuvos Rytas to qualify for the EuroLeague season. The season is widely considered the most controversial in club history.[36][37]

Before the 2010–11 season, Žalgiris re-signed Paulius Jankūnas and DeJuan Collins, signed Tomas Delininkaitis, and brought in Serbian coach Aleksandar Petrović as the new head coach. The season began with Žalgiris playing very strongly, but after a slump, Romanov fired Petrović. They qualified for the Top-16 phase only in the final games, with a 5–5 record. After a controversial departure from center Mirza Begić,[citation needed] the slump continued under new coach Ilias Zouros, with a 1–5 record in the Top-16 phase. However, after the recovery of Marcus Brown (who was injured for most of the season), Žalgiris won back the LKF Cup from Lietuvos Rytas and defeated VEF Riga in the BBL finals. In the LKL finals, Žalgiris easily defeated Lietuvos Rytas 4–1, regaining the LKL title for the first time since 2008.[citation needed]

Due to the NBA lockout that impacted the 2011–12 season, Žalgiris signed former Toronto Raptors wing Sonny Weems and former Denver Nuggets point guard Ty Lawson.[38][39] The team also re-signed long time fan-favorite Marko Popović.[40] and signed longtime Lietuvos Rytas player and former Lithuanian National team captain Robertas Javtokas as center. However, the season started very poorly for Žalgiris. Hoping to end the slump, Romanov fired coach Ilias Zouros and replaced him with former Lietuvos Rytas head coach Aleksandar Trifunović.[41][42] Despite initial improvement, as the team finishing the EuroLeague regular season with a 4–6 record and a trip to the Top 16, the slump continued and the team's EuroLeague season ended quickly.[43] After Ty Lawson left the team, Mantas Kalnietis became a true leader for Žalgiris and played his best season yet.[44] The team slowly recovered, winning the LKF Cup.[45] After being eliminated in the VTB playoffs, Žalgiris made the BBL Final Four, winning against Lietuvos Rytas in the finals despite losing leader Sonny Weems (who was released due to injury) and DeJuan Collins (who was released due to failing a drug test).[46][47] With very solid play from Marko Popovič and Tomas Delininkaitis, Žalgiris retained the LKL title, defeating Lietuvos Rytas in the finals 4–1.[48] The club had achieved a second consecutive ""triple crown"" of Lithuanian League, Lithuanian Cup, and Baltic Cup.[49]

For the 2012–13 season, Žalgiris signed Lithuanian national team players Rimantas Kaukėnas, Darjuš Lavrinovič, and Kšyštof Lavrinovič; Unicaja Malaga star Tremmell Darden; and point guard Oliver Lafayette.[50][51][52] The season began with Žalgiris winning the newly established LKF SuperCup against Lietuvos Rytas. Early in the season, Mantas Kalnietis left the team and was replaced by Ibrahim Jaaber. Under new coach Joan Plaza, Žalgiris had their best EuroLeague start with five consecutive wins. They finished at the top of their group for the first time in 13 years, with an 8–2 record. In their 76–66 home victory against CSKA Moscow, Žalgiris broke their attendance record, with 15,812 spectators.[53] In January 2013, Jaaber departed from the team for personal reasons and was replaced by Donnie McGrath in February. In the coming months, financial troubles returned to the club, which led to the departure of Darden. The crisis coincided with the ongoing collapse of Ūkio Bankas. The bank's main shareholder Vladimir Romanov, who also owned the majority of shares of Žalgiris and was the club's president, abruptly left the country and flew to Russia in early March 2013, abandoning his stake in the club. On 20 March 2013, vice president Paulius Motiejūnas was named the team director. Despite the financial and management struggles, Žalgiris finished the Top-16 phase with a 6–8 record, the best in club history, but narrowly missed the playoffs. Žalgiris also won the group phase in the VTB United League. In May, Žalgiris won their third straight LKL title, sweeping Lietuvos Rytas 4–0 in the finals.[54] After winning the LKL title, Žalgiris competed in the VTB United League playoffs, defeating Nizhny Novgorod in the quarterfinals but losing to Lokomotiv Kuban in the semi-finals. Despite the loss, Žalgiris was awarded the bronze medal for the first time since 2010.[55]

After the loss of team owner Vladimir Romanov and the departure of head coach Joan Plaza, Žalgiris rehired Ilias Zouros as head coach for the 2013–14 season. Žalgiris left the VTB United League because of the changes in the EuroLeague format that meant that the teams who did not qualify for the Top 16 would have a chance to play in the EuroCup playoffs.

Žalgiris signed Justin Dentmon[56] and Šarūnas Jasikevičius to one-year deals.[57] After a poor start to the season, Zouros was fired as head coach and replaced by Saulius Štombergas.[58][59] Žalgiris made the Top 16 for the fifth consecutive time (with a 5–5 record). However, Žalgiris began to struggle in the LKL. The Top 16 proved to be difficult, with Žalgiris losing many games by 5 points or less (a 2–12 record overall).[60] After a few losses in the LKF Cup and the LKL, Štombergas resigned and was replaced by Gintaras Krapikas as interim head coach.[61] In the last week of Top-16 play at home, Žalgiris beat Spanish champions Real Madrid. Justin Dentmon scored 36 points in that game, the most by a Žalgiris player in modern EuroLeague,[62] and Dentmon also made 74 three-pointers during the season (a EuroLeague record since 2000).[63]

After a loss to Lietuvos Rytas in the final LKL regular season game, Žalgiris entered the playoffs as the fourth seed, the worst in club history. They faced Lietuvos Rytas again in the semi-finals, the first time in 15 years that they did not meet in the final round. Žalgiris advanced to the finals against Neptūnas Klaipėda, taking the series 4–2 and winning their fourth consecutive LKL championship.[64]

During the 2014–15 preseason, Žalgiris made significant changes to the squad, replacing Justin Dentmon with Maalik Wayns, who was in turn replaced by Will Cherry.[65] Žalgiris also signed Darius Songaila from rival Lietuvos Rytas and James Anderson from the NBA.[66][67] Šarūnas Jasikevičius retired and became an assistant coach, and more young players were brought to the team.[68] Young point guard Lukas Lekavičius was the main bright spot as the team began LKL play. In the EuroLeague, a 5–5 record sent Žalgiris to the top 16 phase where the team finished with a 5–9 record.[69] In February, Žalgiris won the LKF Cup for the first time in three years.[70] Žalgiris finished the LKL regular season in dominating fashion, with 12 straight wins,[71] and they defeated Lietuvos Rytas in the finals. This win was the club's fifth consecutive LKL title and their 17th overall.[72]

Žalgiris had a total of seven players who competed in EuroBasket 2015.[73] They finished the off-season by signing Ian Vougioukas at center.[74] Žalgiris finished the 2015–16 EuroLeague regular season with a 5–5 record and qualified for the Top-16 phase for the seventh consecutive season.[75] After a poor start to the Top 16, head coach Krapikas was replaced by Šarūnas Jasikevičius, but injuries to Javtokas and the departure of Kalnietis led the team to a huge slump and a loss to Lietuvos Rytas in the King Mindaugas Cup final.[76] After strong criticism of the team management for not finding a center to replace Javtokas, Žalgiris signed new point guard Jerome Randle.[77] While the EuroLeague season ended with a 2–12 record, a hugely disappointing result, the team later recovered by finishing in 1st place in the LKL regular season over King Mindaugas Cup winner Lietuvos Rytas.[78] Žalgiris defeated Neptūnas Klaipėda in the LKL finals, winning their sixth consecutive LKL title with a 4–1 record.[79]

In November 2015, the ongoing conflict between FIBA and Euroleague came to a head when FIBA announced the formation of the Basketball Champions League, and courted EuroLeague teams to join their new championship. However, EuroLeague's long-term-license teams, such as Žalgiris, decided to stay with the Euroleague Basketball Company.[80]

Žalgiris's preparation for the 2016–17 season began during the 2016 LKL finals, when the club signed point guard Léo Westermann to replace the departing Jerome Randle.[81] After the season, long-time Žalgiris players Siim-Sander Vene and Kaspars Vecvagars left the team, while Žalgiris chose to retain the services of Seibutis and Motum.[82][83] Head coach Jasikevičius was pursued by FC Barcelona Lassa, but decided to remain with Žalgiris.[84] To correct the previous season's lack of a good shooter, Žalgiris signed Kevin Pangos; the team was loaned Augusto Lima from Real Madrid to replace Vougioukas at center.[85][86] Žalgiris also signed the returning Artūras Milaknis to a 3-year deal.[87] German prospect Isaiah Hartenstein was scheduled to make his professional debut after being signed the previous season. In August, Žalgiris signed Antanas Kavaliauskas, the captain of Lietuvos Rytas who had previously promised to never play for Žalgiris; Kavaliauskas apologized to fans after the signing was announced.[88]

In February, Žalgiris won their first title of the 2016–17 season, winning the King Mindaugas Cup by defeating Lietkabelis Panevėžys in the finals 84–63.[89] Edgaras Ulanovas was named tournament MVP.[90] In the EuroLeague, Žalgiris exceeded expectations with a 10th-place finish (14–16 record), getting a win against defending champion CSKA Moscow and finishing ahead of FC Barcelona Lassa and Maccabi Tel Aviv.[91] Players Brock Motum, Léo Westermann, Edgaras Ulanovas, and Lukas Lekavičius developed strongly, and team captain Paulius Jankūnas played one of his best seasons of his career, leading the team in scoring and rebounding.[92] In the LKL, Žalgiris won the regular season with only a few losses, sweeping their rival Lietuvos Rytas, with the toughest challenge coming from a powerful Lietkabelis squad that contained former Žalgiris players Darjuš and Kšyštof Lavrinovič. In the LKL playoffs, Žalgiris easily advanced to the finals,[93][94] defeating Lietkabelis for their seventh straight LKL championship, 4–1.[95]

Prior the 2017–18 season, Žalgiris reached an agreement with club sponsor Avia Solutions Group to guarantee private flights for the team during away games in a refurbished business-class Boeing 737.[96][97][98][99] The off-season work began just a week after winning the LKL championship, when breakout player Brock Motum signed with Anadolu Efes S.K.[100] To replace Motum, Žalgiris signed Aaron White, who had played a season with Zenit Saint Petersburg.[101] Léo Westerman signed with CSKA Moscow, and was replaced by talented guard Vasilije Micić.[102][103] To replace Seibutis, Žalgiris originally signed Royce O'Neale, who terminated his deal just weeks later to sign with the Utah Jazz.[104] Žalgiris then signed Axel Toupane to replace him.[105] Because center Robertas Javtokas announced retirement and the loan of Augusto Lima ended, Žalgiris signed Brandon Davies of AS Monaco Basket at the center position.[106][107][108] The most-shocking departure came at the end of June, when breakout point guard Lukas Lekavičius signed a contract with Panathinaikos.[109] Needing a new point guard, Žalgiris signed Dee Bost, also of AS Monaco.[110] Coach Jasikevičius also re-signed with Žalgiris, and the retired Javtokas became the new sports director of the team.[111][112] On September 22, Žalgiris played a game in London against Polski Cukier Toruń, which Žalgiris won 87–61. Žalgiris won the King Mindaugas Cup for the second consecutive year, defeating Lietuvos rytas 81–62 in the finals. Edgaras Ulanovas won the tournament MVP for the second straight year.

In the 2017–18 EuroLeague, Žalgiris was again projected to be one of the worst teams. Žalgiris struggled in the early season before putting together a five-game streak to finish the first round 10–5, tied for third place in the standings. In the second round, Dee Bost was replaced by Beno Udrih. Žalgiris struggled for the first few weeks of the second round, but fought its way to an 18–12 record (sixth place) and qualification for the EuroLeague playoffs for the first time since 2001. The team qualified for the 2018 EuroLeague Final Four after beating Olympiacos in game 4 to clinch a 3–1 series win.[113] The team achieved this despite having the second-lowest budget in the league.[114] Žalgiris lost to Fenerbahçe in the semifinals, 76–67. In the third-place game, Žalgiris faced longtime rivals CSKA Moscow; Žalgiris led by as much as 24 points, but CSKA's late-game rally made it so Žalgiris only narrowly won 79–77, achieving third place in the EuroLeague. In the LKL, Žalgiris won the regular season and beat Lietuvos Rytas in the finals with a 4–1 record, earning their eighth consecutive LKL championship. This was the club's best season since 1999.[115]

After a near-perfect season, the off-season was difficult. Žalgiris lost its front court as Pangos went to FC Barcelona Lassa and Micič signed with Efes. Žalgiris signed Nate Wolters as the team's new point guard. After the departure of Beno Udrih, Žalgiris signed Donatas Sabeckis from Šiauliai, who lead the LKL in assists. Toupane left the team to sign with Olympiacos; to replace him, Žalgiris signed former-teammate Marius Grigonis, who was having a successful career abroad, to a multi-year deal. They also signed talented guard/forward Thomas Walkup. To replace reserve Martynas Sajus, Žalgiris signed Laurynas Birutis, who was loaned to and had a successful season with Šiauliai. Several more reserves, Paulius Valinskas and Gytis Masiulis, were loaned to other LKL teams so that they could gain more playing time. Ulanovas also signed a new contract. Like the previous season, the biggest concern was the future of coach Jasikevičius. Despite offers from other EuroLeague teams and the Toronto Raptors, Jasikevičius remained with Žalgiris, signing a new contract. Former player Tomas Masiulis replaced Darius Songaila in the coaching staff. In September, Žalgiris signed the returning Léo Westermann to fill the point guard spot.

The newly reformed Žalgiris struggled at the start of the 2018–19 EuroLeague season.[116] Needing another point guard, Žalgiris signed Derrick Walton in October. By December, Žalgiris was in sixth place with a 7–7 record. However, injuries decimated the team. Walton's disappointing play led to decreasing playing time and a release in February 2019. Later in February, Žalgiris suffered a loss in the King Mindaugas Cup to Rytas Vilnius, losing the tournament for the first time since 2016 - a disaster for Žalgiris.[117] By the start of March, Žalgiris was 13th in the EuroLeague with a 9–15 record.[116] The team's play started to improve when Walkup was pushed to the point guard position to replace Walton, Westermann returned after being injured, and improving play by Thompson led to a six-game winning streak. Their 15–15 record clinched the final spot in the playoffs, with massive away wins over Maccabi Tel Aviv, Olympiakos Piraeus and Real Madrid, .[116] In the EuroLeague playoffs, Žalgiris lost to Fenerbahçe.[116] Žalgiris broke the EuroLeague's home attendance record with an average of 14,808 spectators in the Žalgiris Arena. In the 2018–19 LKL season, Žalgiris finished the regular season in first place, and swept the series finals against Rytas, winning the series 3–0, for a ninth consecutive LKL championship.[118]

During the off-season, many players (including Westermann and Thompson) left the team, with Antanas Kavaliauskas announcing his retirement after a few very successful seasons with Žalgiris. Lukas Lekavičius returned to the team after two seasons in Greece, and Alex Pérez was signed to replace Westermann. Jock Landale and Zach LeDay, of Olympiacos, were signed to complete the front court. Martinas Geben, who had signed a long-term deal the previous summer, earned a spot on the roster after a successful season with Juventus Utena in the LKL, where he was named Season MVP. Coach Jasikevičius remained with the team for one more season. Pérez, however, spent just a few months with Žalgiris, and was released in November due to his weak play. Žalgiris also signed shooting-guard K. C. Rivers in November.

Žalgiris won the King Mindaugas Cup by beating Rytas Vilnius 80–60 in the finals.[118] Ulanovas was named the MVP of the tournament, his fourth MVP award in Lithuanian Cup competitions. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the 2019–20 LKL season was ended prematurely, and with Žalgiris firmly leading the standings, Žalgiris was announced as champions, their 10th consecutive LKL championship.[118] In the 2019–20 EuroLeague, Žalgiris struggled for most of the season, including plummeting to the bottom of the standings, but recovered by February 2020, finishing with a 12-16 record.[119] With the EuroLeague season stopped due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Žalgiris finished in ninth place.[119]

With the season ending prematurely due to the COVID-19 situation, Žalgiris started their off-season work early. LeDay, Landale, Ulanovas, and Rivers all left the team during the summer, but the biggest departure was of coach Jasikevičius, who left Žalgiris (along with the rest of the coaching staff) and signed with FC Barcelona in July. On July 14, Žalgiris announced the signing of Martin Schiller as the team's new head coach. Schiller had previously worked with the Salt Lake City Stars of the NBA G League, and had been named the NBA G League Coach of the Year in 2020. Schiller brought in Arne Woltmann and Tautvydas Sabonis as his assistant coaches, with Evaldas Beržininkaitis being the only person remaining on the team from Jasikevičius's old staff. Žalgiris brought in a bevy of new players, but the most surprising signing happened in June when Žalgiris bought out Marek Blaževič, a talented prospect, out of rival squad Rytas Vilnius.

While the expectations for the upcoming season were not promising under Schiller, Žalgiris surprised everyone and stayed in the playoff hunt throughout the 2020–21 EuroLeague season. Despite eventually not making the playoffs, Žalgiris finished the EuroLeague season with a respectable 17–17 record.[120] They won the King Mindaugas Cup and their 11th consecutive LKL final by beating Rytas 3–0.[118]

In 2021, Žalgiris signed Tyler Cavanaugh, Niels Giffey, Mantas Kalnietis, Josh Nebo, Edgaras Ulanovas, Jānis Strēlnieks, and Emmanuel Mudiay. They also extended their contract with Lukas Lekavičius. Žalgiris lost all five LKL preseason games, playing seemingly worse each game. Žalgiris had a difficult start in the 2021 LKL regular season—while they won all three games, they struggled even against the weakest of teams. After a 0–2 start in the EuroLeague, Žalgiris fired coach Martin Schiller, replacing him with Jure Zdovc.[121] Injuries to players such as Lauvergne and Strelnieks, struggles in the LKL, and disappointing play from projected leaders such as Mudiay resulted in the worst start ever (0–9) for Žalgiris in the Euroleague.[121] In the LKL, a loss to BC Rytas resulted in Žalgiris falling out of first place.[118]

Žalgiris released Mudiay in November, replacing him with point guard Tai Webster, and signed shooting guard Zoran Dragić. The moves backfired—Webster struggled even in the LKL, while Dragič rarely saw playing time and was released by the end of the year.[121][118] New signees such as Regimantas Miniotas also saw limited playing time.[121][118] Losses in the Euroleague resulted in Žalgiris attendance falling to record lows. By February, Žalgiris was in last place with a disastrous 4–20 record,[121] but recovered by March 2022, including memorable wins over the Jasikevičius-lead FC Barcelona and Real Madrid, future participants of the Euroleague Final Four, in particular thanks to the return of Joffrey Lauvergne from injury. Žalgiris also won the 2022 King Mindaugas Cup, beating BC Lietkabelis 91–66 in the finals.[118]

Žalgiris was the first team to refuse to play against Russian teams in the EuroLeague (CSKA Moscow, Kazan Unics, and Zenit St. Petersburg) due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even gaining criticism in the Russian press for being one of the reasons Russian teams got disqualified. They finished the EuroLeague season with a memorable 103–98 win against KK Crvena zvezda.[121] Žalgiris finished the EuroLeague season with an 8–20 record, above the disqualified CSKA, UNICS, and Zenit, but still in last place of the eligible teams—their worst EuroLeague finish since the 2015–16 season.[121]

By the start of April, disappointment returned to Žalgiris. Struggles in the LKL resulted in Žalgiris once again falling behind Rytas in the standings, and they ended up finishing behind Rytas in the standings for the first time since the 2013–14 season.[118] Žalgiris replaced Zdovc later in the month, signing Lithuanian national basketball team coach Kazys Maksvytis as their new head coach.[118] The struggles continued under Maksvytis, who failed to find a good lineup or rotation with the existing roster.[118]

In the LKL playoffs, the struggles became even more evident. Žalgiris needed all five games to beat BC Neptūnas in the quarterfinals, narrowly winning the series 3–2.[118] Žalgiris won the first semifinal game against BC Lietkabelis, before losing the next three games – Lietkabelis won the series 3–1. Žalgiris had failed to qualify to the LKL finals for the first time ever, ending their 11-year domination of the LKL and finishing the 2021–22 season with the biggest fiasco in team history.[122][118] Žalgiris finished the season by winning the LKL bronze medal, beating BC Šiauliai in the consolation round in a 4–0 sweep.[118] To add insult to injury, Rytas went on to win the LKL championship. Jankūnas retired after the season and became the sports director of Žalgiris.

After the disastrous 2021–2022 season, Žalgiris overwent a radical overhaul from the previous season. Coach Maksvytis had signed a long-term deal before the absolutely catastrophic ending in the LKL. Webster, Nebo, Blaževič, Miniotas, Milaknis, Strelnieks, Giffey, and Lauvergne all left the team during the summer. Former team captain Paulius Jankūnas remained, as a sporting director, assisting director Paulius Motiejūnas. Only a handful of players, among the key ones Lekavičius and Ulanovas, named team captain after Jankūnas and who signed long-term extensions, remained with the team. One of the biggest problems of the previous season was settled when Žalgiris signed Keenan Evans as the new point guard for the team. Kevarrius Hayes and former Žalgiris player Laurynas Birutis were signed to replace Lauvergne and Nebo as centers, Rolands Šmits was signed as a replacement for Jankūnas. Tomas Dimša, who had signed with Žalgiris as early as 2020, returned to the team. Dovydas Giedraitis, who played an incredible season with BC Lietkabelis, and who was one of the main reasons Lietkabelis beat Žalgiris the previous season, was bought out of his contract in Spain, where he was signed to Estudiantes Madrid, and was loaned to Lietkabelis by his team, and signed a long-term contract with Žalgiris. However, the biggest signings for Žalgiris, for the summer, were Arnas Butkevičius, Rytas captain and one of the most important parts of the Rytas 2022 LKL championship winning team, and Ignas Brazdeikis – former NBA player, standout in college, and who returned to play in Lithuania, both on the national team and for Žalgiris – for the first time since moving to Canada at a young age. Despite solid additions, the awful performances of the previous season haunted the team; while Žalgiris became an instant favorite to regain the LKL crown, in the Euroleague, the team was not even considered to be anywhere near playoff contention, with many experts predicting last place for Žalgiris in the Euroleague.

Despite this, and the fact that head coach Kazys Maksvytis had only a brief experience in the Euroleague (as head coach for Neptūnas Klaipėda in the 2014-2015 season), Žalgiris shocked the Euroleague; led by Evans, Žalgiris fought nearly every team, at home or away, to the deciding seconds, winning most of the matches. Keenan Evans dominated with incredible performances. In December, however, Evans suffered a season-ending achilles tendon injury; at this point, Žalgiris was 9-8 in the first round of the Euroleague, in playoff contention. While many believed this to be the end of Žalgiris's good run in the Euroleague, Žalgiris recovered – signing Isaiah Taylor, as the new point guard to replace Evans, and Achille Polonara, both from Efes – before the second round. Brazdeikis, who finally adjusted to the European game after a difficult first half of the season, became team leader, with Ulanovas, Šmits, Hayes, and, after a time of adjusting, Taylor and Polonara all contributing. Butkevičius quickly became a fan favorite for his amazing defence and his hustle, with the former Rytas captain becoming among the most popular players among Žalgiris fans. Mantas Kalnietis, remaining after disastrous season, ended up retiring in February and moving to back-office work with Žalgiris, mostly with the Žalgiris football team. Žalgiris was 15-15 by the start of April, and made an amazing run to the Euroleague playoffs, capped off with wins over Maccabi Tel Aviv at home and FC Bayern Munich away, to reach the playoffs, as the 7th seed, with a 19-15 record and with wins over Fenerbahçe and Baskonia Vitoria. Žalgiris also finished second in attendance, behind KK Partizan, with fans selling out 16 of the 17 home games, starting in October, because of which, the Žalgirio Arena became the host of the Euroleague Final Four tournament. In the Euroleague playoffs, Žalgiris faced off against FC Barcelona, coached by ex-Žalgiris coach Šarūnas Jasikevičius. Despite best efforts, and the fact that Žalgiris had beaten Barcelona in the regular season at home, Barcelona proved too much for Žalgiris, beating them 91-69, 89-81, and 77-66 for a victorious 3-0 sweep. However, the incredible performance of Žalgiris in the Euroleague earned the team a standing ovation in the last game in Kaunas.

Žalgiris won the 2023 edition of the King Mindaugas Cup, their fourth consecutive Cup victory, with Ulanovas once again being named the MVP of the finals. In the LKL, Žalgiris finished first in the regular season, with a win over defending LKL champions BC Rytas in April, and finished with a 28-5 record. In the playoffs, Žalgiris swept BC Nevėžis in the quarterfinals 2-0, to set up a rematch against BC Lietkabelis; this time, Žalgiris beat Lietkabelis 3-1 to avenge the previous season loss, with a satisfying, dominating 95-66 win in Panevėžys in the deciding game. In the LKL finals, Žalgiris faced Rytas, the series going a full five games, with Rytas giving Žalgiris a fight in each game, with Žalgiris beating Rytas in Kaunas, 108-93 and 95-80, but Rytas winning in Vilnius, 94-71 and 69-68, to set up a decisive fifth game in Kaunas. Žalgiris would win the deciding game 97-87, winning the series 3-2, and regaining the LKL championship. Taylor, who scored 32 points in the championship winning game, was named the LKL Finals MVP.

After an incredible 2022–2023 season, Žalgiris re-signed much of the team. However, Paulius Motiejūnas, club director since 2013, departed the team and headed to become the director of Euroleague Basketball, a move that many had anticipated during the 2023 season. Paulius Jankūnas took over as club director, in addition to being the sporting director. With Keenan Evans returning from injury, Žalgiris also made an unpopular decision not to re-sign Isaiah Taylor, the MVP of the LKL finals and Žalgiris leader during the victorious series against Rytas. Among other departing players, Tyler Cavanaugh and Karolis Lukošiūnas left during the summer. To replace Taylor, Žalgiris signed Naz Mitrou-Long to the point guard position and also signed Brady Manek, former NCAA standout, to a contract to replace the departed Cavanaugh. With much of the younger Žalgiris players, in particular Motiejus Krivas, departing to the NCAA, Žalgiris also signed Danielius Lavrinovičius, fresh off his career-best season with BC Nevėžis, to a contract.

With what seemed as solid additions during the summer, as well as keeping much of the same roster as the previous 2023 season, Žalgiris looked to continue where they left off the previous season. At the start of the season, however, Žalgiris suffered a massive blow as team leader Ignas Brazdeikis was bought out by Olympiakos Piraeus; the move became even more haunting when Žalgiris decided not to immediately search for Brazdeikis's replacement. Despite the departure by Brazdeikis, Žalgiris started the season strong, being undefeated in the LKL and 3-1 in the Euroleague, sparked by the incredible return to form by Keenan Evans. However, by October, the bottom fell out; struggling even in the LKL, Žalgiris completely fell apart in the Euroleague, going into the second round of the Euroleague with a disastrous 2-11 finish in the first. Mitrou-Long struggled as point guard, and by November, was also bought out by Olympiakos. The eventual replacement for Brazdeikis, Edmond Sumner, played too inconsistently to make any difference. Injuries hurt the team, in particular an injury to Arnas Butkevičius, one of Žalgiris top defensive players; his brief replacement, Austin Hollins, had a forgettable stint with Žalgiris. Rumours of Andrea Trinchieri coming in to replace coach Maksvytis began as early as December, followed by a reported player mutiny which resulted in Maksvytis remaining with Žalgiris for the time being. However, the tragic finish in the Euroleague first round, with a 5-12 record, resulted in Žalgiris and Maksvytis mutually parting ways by the end of December; and coach Trinchieri was brought in to replace him.

Under Trinchieri, Žalgiris had a ressurgence; in the second round of the Euroleague, Žalgiris returned to playoff contention, and fought for the final spot of the Euroleague Play-In tournament all the way to April. Laurynas Birutis became one of the best players for Žalgiris, completely overshadowing Kevarrius Hayes and taking over as starting center, and Dovydas Giedraitis became one of the best defensive players, not just for Žalgiris, but in the whole Euroleague. Lead by Evans, Žalgiris fought until April for a spot in the Play-In tournament, before an away loss to AS Monaco ended their hopes for Euroleague playoffs. Under Trinchieri, Žalgiris finished with a 9-8 record, going 14-20 overall. Keenan Evans had incredible performances all season, establishing himself as one of the top guards of the Euroleague.

Žalgiris also won the 2024 King Mindaugas Cup, held in Kaunas, beating BC Wolves in the quarterfinals, BC Šiauliai in the semifinals, and BC Lietkabelis (who had eliminated BC Rytas in the semifinals) in the finals. Laurynas Birutis was named the tournament MVP. In the LKL, for most of the season, Žalgiris dominated, sweeping Rytas in the regular season, to finish with a 26-4 record, with no other team in the LKL coming close to Žalgiris. During the season, it also became clear that Žalgiris greatly relied on Keenan Evans. Žalgiris chose not to search for another point guard after Mitrou-Long departed in November, with only Lekavičius remaining in the spot. Žalgiris also made a dubious decision to re-sign Karolis Lukošiūnas in February, a decision that ended up even more questionable when Lukošiūnas, after playing a few games, was out for the whole season by the end of March. Before the end of the transfer table in the LKL, Žalgiris also signed Demetrie Rivers; while Rivers had some good games for Žalgiris in the LKL, he barely saw any playing time by the playoffs. In the playoffs, Žalgiris beat M-Basket Delamode Mažeikiai 2-0 in the quarterfinals. The semifinals, against BC Lietkabelis, was a nightmare; in the deciding game of the victorious 3-0 Žalgiris sweep to set up a rematch against Rytas, Evans suffered a season-ending injury by rupturing his patellar ligaments. Without Evans, Žalgiris fell apart. With nobody stepping up for Žalgiris in the finals, Rytas took advantage, taking home-court advantage away from Žalgiris, and finishing off the still shocked Žalgiris 3-1 in the LKL finals to regain the LKL title, while ending the already difficult season for Žalgiris in a complete disaster. This win by Rytas over Žalgiris is considered the biggest upset in LKL history.

At the team's inception in 1944, when Lithuania was a Soviet Socialist Republic, Žalgiris began competing in both the Soviet Union National League and the domestic Lithuanian SSR League. When the country declared independence from the USSR in 1991 and the Soviet League folded, Žalgiris competed in the Lithuanian League (a successor of the Lithuanian SSR League) for two years before the newly-reinstated Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF) established the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) as the country's premier basketball league in 1993, with Žalgiris as a founding member.

In 2007, the LKF established the LKF Cup (Lietuvos Krepšinio Federacijos Taurė) as an annual tournament for domestic clubs. Before 2007, the LKF Cup had been held twice—once in 1989–90 and once in 1997–89. It was replaced in 2016 by the King Mindaugas Cup, a mid-season tournament for LKL teams that runs from October to February.

Many players who spent time with Žalgiris also played in the NBA. The most notable example is Arvydas Sabonis, who spent seven seasons with the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers including a Western Conference Finals run in 2000. Other notable crossovers include 1994 NBA All-Star Kenny Anderson, two-time NBA champion Beno Udrih, Ty Lawson, Robert Pack, and current NBA players Boban Marjanovic, Isaiah Hartenstein, Jock Landale, and Vasilije Micić.

During the Soviet era, Žalgiris had an intense rivalry with CSKA Moscow, the multiple-time champion and symbol of the Red Army. Their matchups would draw huge crowds in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The rivalry peaked during the 1980s, with the teams meeting in the USSR championship finals six times, which Žalgiris won in 1985, 1986, and 1987. It is considered to be the top rivalry in USSR basketball, as CSKA remains one of the most-hated teams in Kaunas to this day. During the 2000s and 2010s, the teams met many times in the EuroLeague, with CSKA winning most of the matches. In 2018, during the EuroLeague third place match, Žalgiris narrowly defeated CSKA, 79–77. Over the years, the two teams also met in the NEBL, as well as the VTB United League, with the matches drawing huge crowds. In 2012, one such VTB match drew a record attendance of 15,812, a record for the competition and for the Žalgiris Arena.

After the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania and the Independence of Lithuania in 1990, and the establishment of the Lithuanian Basketball League in 1993, Žalgiris had a rivalry with BC Atletas, coached by former-Žalgiris head coach Vladas Garastas, with both teams fighting for the LKL championship. The teams met in the LKL finals four times, with Žalgiris winning each time. Starting in 1998, Žalgiris's main rival has been BC Lietuvos Rytas, also known as BC Rytas, from Vilnius. The matches draw the biggest interest in all of LKL, with the teams having met in the finals 17 times, with Žalgiris winning 12 times and Rytas 5. The teams constantly fight for first place in the LKL standings. In the LKF Cup, King Mindaugas Cup, Baltic Basketball League, and the NEBL, Žalgiris wins most of their matchups. During the 2010s, Žalgiris has largely dominated the rivalry, with sweeps in the finals in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2019, and in the regular season in 2017. In the 2018–19 season, Žalgiris swept Rytas in both the regular season and the final series.

Žalgiris basketball club was featured in the video game NBA 2K14, along with thirteen other top EuroLeague teams.[153][154] The club was also featured in NBA 2K15, NBA 2K16 and NBA 2K17.[155][156][157]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Žalgiris
Prussian Lithuanians,"The Prussian Lithuanians, or Lietuvininkai[1] (singular: Lietuvininkas, plural: Lietuvininkai), are Lithuanians,[2] originally Lithuanian language speakers, who formerly inhabited a territory in northeastern East Prussia called Prussian Lithuania, or Lithuania Minor (Lithuanian: Prūsų Lietuva, Mažoji Lietuva, German: Preußisch-Litauen, Kleinlitauen), instead of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and, later, the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuania Major, or Lithuania proper). Prussian Lithuanians contributed greatly to the development of written Lithuanian, which for a long time was considerably more widespread and in more literary use in Lithuania Minor than in Lithuania proper.[3]

Unlike most Lithuanians, who remained Roman Catholic after the Protestant Reformation, most Lietuvininkai became Lutheran-Protestants (Evangelical-Lutheran).

There were 121,345 speakers of Lithuanian in the Prussian census of 1890. Almost all Prussian Lithuanians were murdered or expelled after World War II, when East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union. The northern part became the Kaliningrad Oblast, while the southern part was attached to Poland. Only the small Klaipėda Region (German: Memelland) was attached to Lithuania.

The term Preußische Litauer (Prussian Lithuanians in German) appeared in German texts of the 16th century. The term Kleinlitaw (Lithuania Minor in German) was first used by Simon Grunau between 1517 and 1527. Prussian Lithuanians used various names for themselves: Prussians (Lithuanian: Prūsai, German: Preusch), Prussian Lithuanians (Lithuanian: Pruſû Lietuwiai, Pruſû Lietuvininkai, Pruſißki Lietuvininkai, German: Preußische Litauer), or simply Lithuanians (Lithuanian: Lietuw(i)ni(n)kai, German: Litauer). Local self-designating terms found in literature, such as Sziszionißkiai (""people from here""), Burai (German: Bauern), were neither politonyms nor ethnonyms. Another similar term appeared in the Klaipėda Region (Memelland) during the interwar years – Memellanders[4] (Lithuanian: Klaipėdiškiai, German: Memelländer). Modern Lithuanian historiography uses the term Lietuvininkai[5] or sometimes a neologism unknown to Lietuwininkai themselves, Mažlietuviai. The usage of Lietuvininkai is problematic as it is a synonym of the word Lietuviai (""Lithuanians""), and not the name of a separate ethnic sub-group.

For Prussian Lithuanians loyalty to the German state, strong religious beliefs, and the mother tongue were the three main criteria of self-identification.[6] Due to differences in religion and loyalties to a different state, the Prussian Lithuanians did not consider Lithuanians of the Grand Duchy to be part of their community. They used the exonym Samogitians (Lithuanian: Źemaicziai, German: Szameiten) to denote Lithuanians of Lithuania Major.[7] As with other closely related groups with differing religions (e.g. Northern Ireland, former Yugoslavia), antagonism was frequent between the Lutheran Prussian Lithuanians and the Catholic Lithuanians of the Grand Duchy, despite the common language. For example, inhabitants of Lithuania did not trust Prussian Lithuanians in the Klaipėda Region and tended to eliminate them from posts in government institutions.[8] When Prussian Lithuanian writer Ieva Simonaitytė (Ewa Simoneit) chose the side of the Lithuanian Republic, she was condemned by relatives, friends and neighbours.[9] Only one Prussian Lithuanian, Dovas Zaunius, worked in the government of Lithuania[citation needed] between World War I and World War II. The antagonism persisted until the end of World War II.

The territory where Prussian Lithuanians lived in ancient times was inhabited by the Old Prussian, Skalvian and Curonian tribes. The area between the rivers Alle and Neman became almost uninhabited during the 13th-century Prussian Crusade and wars between the pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Teutonic Order.[10] This uninhabited area was named the wilderness in chronicles. Local tribes were resettled, either voluntarily or by force, in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the 1422 Treaty of Melno, a stable border between the two states was established. Better living conditions in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights attracted many Lithuanians and Samogitians to settle there.[10] Masurians and Curonians began moving into Prussia around the same time.

After 1525, the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Albert became duke of Prussia and converted to Protestantism. Many Prussian Lithuanians also became Protestants. By the will of Albert, church services for Prussian Lithuanians were held in the Lithuanian language. Although Lithuanians who settled in Prussia were mainly farmers, in the 16th century there was an influx of educated Protestant immigrants from Lithuania, such as Martynas Mažvydas, Abraomas Kulvietis and Stanislovas Rapolionis, who became among the first professors at Königsberg University, founded in 1544. Martynas Mažvydas was a zealous Protestant and urged citizens to stop all contact between Prussian Lithuanians and Lithuanians living in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in a bid to curtail Catholic influence in the country.[11]

The Lithuanian-speaking population was dramatically decreased by the Great Northern War plague outbreak in 1700–1721 which killed 53 percent of residents in Lithuania Minor and more than 90 percent of the deceased were Prussian Lithuanians.[12] To compensate for the loss, King Frederick II of Prussia invited settlers from Salzburg, the Palatinate, and Nassau to repopulate the area. Many of these Lutherans were members of the Pietism movement, which then spread among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1811 a teacher's seminary for Prussian Lithuanians was established in Karalene near Insterburg, which remained open until 1924. From the mid-18th century, a majority of Prussian Lithuanians were literate; in comparison, the process was much slower in the Grand Duchy.[citation needed]

The nationalistic Lithuanian national revival in the late 19th century was not popular with Prussian Lithuanians. To them integration with Lithuania was not understandable and not acceptable.[6][4] The idea of Lithuanian–Latvian unity was more popular than idea of Lithuanian-Prussian Lithuanian unity during the Great Seimas of Vilnius, a conference held in 1905.[13]

The first Prussian Lithuanian elected to the Reichstag, Jonas Smalakys, was a fierce agitator for the integrity of the German Empire. In 1879, Georg Sauerwein published the poem Lietuwininkais esame mes gime in the newspaper Lietuwißka Ceitunga. The 7th stanza was dedicated to Wilhelm I, German Emperor.

There was no national Germanization policy until 1873; Prussian Lithuanians voluntarily adopted German language and culture.[14] After the Unification of Germany in 1871, when part of Lithuania became integrated with the new nation of Germany, learning the German language was made compulsory in state schools. Studying the German language provided the possibility for Prussian Lithuanians to become acquainted with Western European culture and values.[14] However, Germanization also provoked a cultural movement among Prussian Lithuanians. In 1879 and 1896, petitions for the return of the Lithuanian language to schools was signed by 12,330 and 23,058 Prussian Lithuanians from the districts of Memel, Heydekrug, Tilsit and Ragnit.[15] In 1921, the French administration made a survey in the Klaipėda Region that showed that only 2.2 percent of Prussian Lithuanians would prefer purely Lithuanian schools.[14] The Lithuanian language and culture were not persecuted in Prussia. By contrast, there were restrictive Russification policies and a Lithuanian press ban in the parts of Lithuania that had become part of the Russian Empire. The Prussian Lithuanians could publish their own newspapers and books, even helping Lithuanians in Russia to bypass their press ban by publishing their newspapers, such as Auszra and Varpas.

The northern part of East Prussia beyond the Neman River was detached from East Prussia at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, dividing the territories inhabited by Prussian Lithuanians between Weimar Germany and the Klaipėda Region (Memelland) under the administration of the Council of Ambassadors, which was formed to enforce the agreements reached in the Treaty of Versailles. The organisation ""Deutsch-Litauischer Heimatbund"" (Lithuanian: Namynês Bundas) sought reunification with Germany or to create an independent state of Memelland and had a membership of 30,000 individuals. Two dozen pro-Lithuanian representatives of the Prussian Lithuanian National Council signed the Act of Tilsit, asking to unite the Klaipėda Region with Lithuania; the idea was not supported by the majority of Prussian Lithuanians.[6] World War I was followed by severe economical hardships and inflation in Germany. In 1923, the Republic of Lithuania occupied the Klaipėda Region during the Klaipėda Revolt.

A secret report of 1923 by Jonas Polovinskas-Budrys, a Lithuanian professional counterintelligence officer, shows around 60 percent of the local inhabitants supported the revolt, 30 percent were neutral and 10 percent were against, namely the supporters of a freistadt status or reunification with Germany.[15] Soon Lithuanian policies alienated the Prussian Lithuanians. People from Greater Lithuania were sent to assume public administration posts in the region. According to the Lithuanian view, the Prussian Lithuanians were Germanized Lithuanians who should be re-Lithuanized.[4] Prussian Lithuanians saw this Lithuanization policy as a threat to their own culture and began to support German political parties, and even started identifying themselves as Germans.[8] During the 1925 census, 37,626 people declared themselves to be Lithuanians and 34,337 people identified themselves as Memellanders, a neologism to distinguish themselves from Lithuanians. Inhabitants of the Klaipėda Region continuously voted for German or German-oriented parties.[14]

Nazi Germany invaded Klaipėda after the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania. The inhabitants were allowed to choose Lithuanian citizenship. Only 500 asked for citizenship, and only 20 were awarded it.[citation needed] The reunification of Klaipėda with Germany was met with joy by a majority of inhabitants.[4] About 10,000 refugees, mostly Jews, fled the region.[18]

After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Prussian Lithuanian activists living in Germany were persecuted.[citation needed] In 1938, Prussian and Lithuanian place names in East Prussia were translated into German or replaced by German names often unrelated to the Lithuanian toponym. For example, Lasdehnen (Lazdynai) became Haselberg, Jodlauken (Juodlaukiai) became Schwalbental, and so on. The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper Naujaſis Tilźes Keleiwis was not closed down until 1940, during World War II. Church services in Tilsit and Ragnit were held in the Lithuanian language until the evacuation of East Prussia in late 1944.

The evacuation started late; the Red Army approached much faster than expected and cut off the territorial connection with other German-held territories by January 26, 1945. Many refugees perished due to Soviet low-flying strafing attacks on the civilians columns,[19] or the extreme cold. However, many managed to flee by land or sea into those parts of Germany captured by the British and Americans.[19] Among the latter were the pastors A. Keleris, J. Pauperas, M. Preikšaitis, O. Stanaitis, A. Trakis, and J. Urdse, who gathered those from the Lithuanian parishes and reorganised the Lithuanian church in the western zones of Allied-occupied Germany.[19]

The Red Army made no distinction between Germans of Prussian Lithuanian or German ethnicity.[19] During the evacuation of East Prussia, Prussian Lithuanians, like other East Prussians, fled in an attempt to escape.[19] Mass murder, rape, and looting were the common fate of those who did not succeed. After the end of war, some Prussian Lithuanians tried to return to their East Prussian homes, but they were discriminated against and denied food rations by the Soviets.[19]

All who remained at the war's end were expelled from Soviet's Kaliningrad Oblast and from the former Klaipėda Region, which was transferred to the Lithuanian SSR in 1947. By 1945, there were only about 20,000 inhabitants left in the Klaipėda Region, compared to the 152,800 in 1939. The government of the Lithuanian SSR followed Soviet policy and viewed the Prussian Lithuanians as Germans. About 8,000 persons were repatriated from DP camps during 1945–50. However, their homes and farms were not returned as either Russians or Lithuanians had already occupied their property. Prussians who remained in the former Memel (Klaipėda) territory were fired from their jobs and otherwise discriminated against.[20] After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some Prussian Lithuanians and their descendants did not regain lost property in the Klaipėda region.[21]

In 1951 about 3,500 people from the former Memel Territory were expelled by the authority of the Lithuanian SSR to East Germany. After Konrad Adenauer's visit to Moscow in 1958, the former citizens of Germany were allowed to emigrate, and the majority of Prussian Lithuanians in the Lithuanian SSR emigrated to West Germany. Only about 2,000 local Lithuanians chose to remain in the Klaipėda Region and virtually none in the Kaliningrad Oblast. The majority of Prussian Lithuanians today live in the Federal Republic of Germany. Together with 65,000 refugees from Lithuania proper, mostly Roman Catholic, who made their way to the western occupation zones of Germany, by 1948 they had founded 158 schools in the Lithuanian language.[22]

Due to the emigration of many Lithuanians overseas and the assimilation of the remaining Prussian Lithuanians in Germany, the number of Lithuanian schools has now dwindled to only one, Litauisches Gymnasium/Vasario 16-osios gimnazija (Lithuanian High School) (in German) in Lampertheim in Hesse.[22] Until 1990, this secondary boarding school was the only Lithuanian school outside areas controlled by the Soviet Union. It was attended by several well-known exiled Lithuanians, such as the singer Lena Valaitis.

Communities of Prussian Lithuanians have developed in Canada, the United States, Sweden and Australia.[citation needed] However, a separate ethnic and cultural identity for Prussian Lithuanians is not as strong as it once was, and cultural differences are gradually vanishing.[citation needed]

The Prussian Lithuanians that settled in the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights over the centuries were influenced by German culture and the German language. They adopted the cultural values and social conventions of the German state, but preserved their Lithuanian language,[4] traditions and folk culture. For centuries Prussian Lithuanians lived in a political and religious environment that was different from that of other Lithuanians and evolved into a separate ethnic group. The common state united some aspects of, traditions and folk culture.[4] who viewed its rulers as their own rulers.[7] Hanging portraits of the rulers of the House of Hohenzollern in the home was widespread.

The Pietist congregational movement attracted large numbers of Prussian Lithuanians: evangelical fellowships (German: Stundenhalter, Lithuanian: Surinkimininkai) were very active in Prussia, as they were in the rest of the German Empire. About 40 percent of Lithuanians belonged to such fellowships, whose members lived by ascetic principles.[4]

Until the mid-19th century Prussian Lithuanians were mostly villagers. Their feudal mentality is reflected in the poem The Seasons by Kristijonas Donelaitis. The Seasons criticizes the tendency to adopt German ways, since this was often associated with decadent noblemen. Donelaitis called for Lithuanians to do their duty, to not envy those who went to town, to not complain or be lazy, and try to work as much as was needed to be a good peasant:

Towns were not large. People who emigrated to the major towns, Königsberg and Memel, usually became bilingual and eventually became Germanized.[dubious – discuss]

After World War II, virtually no Prussian Lithuanians remained in Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast and only a small number survived in the Lithuanian SSR. Their peasant culture, first threatened by Germanization in the German Empire and politically oppressed in the Nazi era, was now completely wiped out by the Soviets, who made no distinction between Germans and Lithuanians. The situation was somewhat better in the former Memel Territory but even there churches and cemeteries were destroyed.[25]

Prussian Lithuanian surnames often consist of a patronymic with suffixes ""-eit"" and ""-at"". It has the same role as the English suffix ""-son"" in the surnames Abrahamson and Johnson. Examples include: Abromeit, Grigoleit, Jakeit, Wowereit, Kukulat, Szameitat.

Another type of Prussian Lithuanian surname use the suffixes ""-ies"" or ""-us"": Kairies, Resgies, Baltßus, Karallus.

A difference existed between female and male surnames in everyday speech. For example, while officially the wife of Kurschat (Prussian Lithuanian Kurßaitis or Kurßatis) was also called Kurschat, in the Prussian Lithuanian language special forms were used in speech: the form of a wife's surname was Kurßaitê / Kurßatė and the form of an unmarried woman was Kurßaitikê / Kurßaitukê.

Since the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, Prussian Lithuanians have typically been bilingual.[4]

The spoken language mainly used by Prussian Lithuanians belongs to the Low Prussian dialect of Low German, Mundart des Ostgebietes subdialect.[citation needed] In institutions (High) German was used.

The Lithuanian language of Prussian Lithuanians could be divided into two main dialects: Samogitian dialect and Aukštaitian dialect. The standard Prussian Lithuanian language is quite similar to standard Lithuanian except for the number of German loanwords. The Lithuanian language which was spoken in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was influenced by Polish and Ruthenian, while in Prussia it was influenced more heavily by the German language. Thus, while Lithuanians used Slavic loanwords and translations, Prussian Lithuanians used German loanwords and translations, and some Slavic loanwords.

Literature in the Lithuanian language appeared earlier in the Duchy of Prussia than in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first book in Lithuanian was published in Königsberg in 1547 by Martynas Mažvydas, an émigré from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while the first Lithuanian book in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was printed in 1596 by Mikalojus Daukša. Many other authors who wrote in Lithuanian were not Prussian Lithuanians, but local Prussian Germans: Michael Märlin, Jakob Quandt, Wilhelm Martinius, Gottfried Ostermeyer, Sigfried Ostermeyer, Daniel Klein, Andrew Krause, Philipp Ruhig, Matttheus Praetorius, Christian Mielcke, Adam Schimmelpfennig, for example. The first major Lithuanian poet, Kristijonas Donelaitis, was from East Prussia and reflected the Prussian Lithuanian lifestyle in his works. The first newspaper in the Lithuanian language, Nuſidawimai apie Ewangēliôs Praſiplatinima tarp Źydû ir Pagonû, was published by Prussian Lithuanians. Prior to World War I, the government and political parties financed the Prussian Lithuanian press.

The Prussian Lithuanian orthography was based on the German style, while in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania it was primarily based on the Polish style. Prussian Lithuanians used Gothic script. Lithuanians did not read Prussian Lithuanian publications and vice versa; the cultural communication was very limited. Attempts to create a unified newspaper and common orthography for all Lithuanian speakers at the beginning of the 20th century were unsuccessful. After 1905, modern Lithuanian orthography was standardized while Prussian Lithuanian orthography remained the same – German Gothic script, a noun was begun with a capital letter, the letters ſ, ß, ʒ were used, and the construction of sentences was different from Lithuanian.

Books and newspapers that were published in Lithuania in Roman type were reprinted in Gothic script in Memel Territory in 1923–39. The Prussian Lithuanian newspaper Naujaſis Tilźes Keleiwis (German: Neues Tilsiter Wanderer) was published in Tilsit in Gothic style until 1940, when it was closed by the Nazis.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_Lithuanians
Lithuanian land confederation,"The Lithuanian land confederation (Lithuanian: Lietuvių žemių konfederacija) was a political union between the early dukes of Lithuania that constituted the transition to the early feudal Lithuanian state. It was part of a larger trend in the 13th century of various Baltic tribes forming land confederations, albeit none gave rise to individual Baltic states such as the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[a] This period also marked the emergence of the allod, wherein an individual family would own land, replacing communal land ownership.[1] It would be another key factor in the emerging unification of the Lithuanian tribes.[2]

According to historians, the main reason for the formation of the land confederation was the transition of tribal nobility into landed lords called kunigai, who were backed by their own standing armies. The strongest of these landed lords consolidated their hegemony and became senior dukes with their own duchies. These dukes headed the land confederation, which covered the lands of ethnic Lithuanians. The Lithuanians were also in an advantageous position due to the state of the nearby fractured and weak Slavic duchies; attacks from Lithuania increased the power of the Lithuanian dukes.[3]

The land confederation's core belonged to the historical land of Lithuania and possibly southern Nalšia. At first, the most prominent of the confederation's senior dukes were Dangerutis and Steksė. However, they died in fights with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, and so their place was taken by five other dukes (representing three families): Živinbudas, Daujotas with Viligaila and Dausprungas with Mindaugas. They controlled the areas of Kuleiniai, Laukuva, Tverai, Ariogala, Betygala, Raseiniai, Šiauliai, Upytė, Deltuva, Neris, east and north Nalšia, and Karšuva, which had their own respective lesser dukes. These lesser and senior dukes were the signatories of the Galicia-Volhynia Treaty of 1219, the primary source of the land confederation. Also subordinate to the confederation's command were Gerdenis and Daumantas, dukes of Polotsk and Pskov respectively.[3]

It is known that in some cases, such as in 1207, the confederation's entire army was raised,[4] though usually local ducal armies sufficed. After the death of Dausprungas, Mindaugas became head of the family and dealt with political enemies, consolidating power, thus becoming Grand Duke and eventually, King of Lithuania.[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_land_confederation
Metropolis of Lithuania,"The Metropolis of Lithuania was a metropolis of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in the Eastern Orthodox Church. It was erected on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania between 1315 and 1317. It was disestablished in 1371.[1] The seat (cathedra) of the metropolis was initially in  Navahrudak. It had only two metropolitan bishops. The establishment took place in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' which was exploited by the rulers of Lithuania to greatly expand their territory. To help legitimize their annexations and to bind their new subjects more closely to the state, the royal powers favoured the erection of a metropolis for the inhabitants of the Grand Principality. To avert the possibility of  the state going over to the Holy See, the hierarchs based in Moscow latterly supported the erection of the metropolis as the lesser of two evils. Throughout the existence of the metropolis, the metropolitans struggled for religious control of the Rus' eparchies with the secular  and religious powers in the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, the Principality of Tver, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow.

Having escaped the brunt of the Mongol invasions, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into neighbouring areas that had been weakened by internal strife and by the Mongol predations. While these expansions were usually at the expense of slavic principalities of the former Kievan Rus', sometimes they were voluntary. For example, the dukes of the Principality of Turov began to cooperate more and more with the Grand Duchy and by the early 14th century the Principality non-violently joined the Grand Duchy. In 1320, most of the principalities of western Rus' were either made into vassals or were directly annexed by Lithuania. In 1321, Gediminas captured Kiev, sending Stanislav, the last Rurikid to rule Kiev, into exile. Gediminas also re-established the permanent capital of the Grand Duchy in Vilnius,[2] presumably moving it from Old Trakai in 1323.[3] The state continued to expand its territory under the reign of Grand Duke Algirdas and his brother Kęstutis, who both ruled the state in harmony.[4][5]

At the time, religious allegiance played an important role in politics. While adhering to the pagan faith, Grand Dukes Vytenis and Gediminas understood the political importance of controlling the Church. Furthermore, the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus' — Peter of Moscow — moved the seat of the metropolis to Moscow.[6] The lack of a metropolitan bishop for the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy impeded the development of the idea of a single Lithuanian state that was being advanced by the ruling family.[7] At the same time, the religious leaders in Rus' realised that the lack of a separate metropolis would leave the Lithuanian state susceptible to the influence of the Latin Church. In attempting to preserve the continued cultural and religious unity of Rus', the Orthodox leaders realised that they might ultimately drive the people into the arms of Rome.[8] By the mid-1350's, the senior clergy of the Rus' in Lithuania were agreed that a separate Lithuanian metropolis was the lesser of two evils. The question was raised in their letters to patriarchate in Constantinople between 1328 and 1347.[9] Consequently, the Grand Dukes of Lithuania requested the Patriarch to establish a separate diocese that was independent from Moscow.

The Patriarch of Constantinople generally preferred a united Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus' and was reluctant to divide its authority. Therefore, whenever possible, the patriarchs would unite the metropoles in the former territory of Kievan Rus'. By the 1440s however, just before the Fall of Constantinople, the Grand Duchy of Moscow had effectively won the dispute and became the new spiritual center of the Orthodox tradition in Eastern Europe.

Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos established the metropolis while Patriarch John XIII of Constantinople ordained the prelate - Theophilus — who was of Rus' origin.[10] A surviving list of his property shows that Theophilus traveled extensively around the Rus' principalities and presented expensive gifts to prominent rulers of the region,[11] perhaps as part of a campaign to become the Metropolitan of Kiev.

The episcopal see of the metropolis was in Navahrudak. It had two suffragan dioceses in Turov and Polatsk.[1]

From 1303 to 1347, a new metropolis also existed on the southern borders of the Lithuanian lands - the Metropolis of Halych. There were long periods of time when this metropolitan seat lay vacant.

From 1317 to 1329[12] Grand Duke Gediminas flirted with Roman Catholicism and wrote to Pope John XXII. The pope replied in 1324[13] and an active attempt to bring Lithuania into the Latin camp was made. Envoys were dispatched to Vilna, but when they arrived the situation had changed. Gediminas claimed that he had never said in his letters that he was ready to be baptized and that his scribes, the Franciscan brothers Henry and Berthold apparently had written things which he had never told them. The papal legates reported to the pope that the magnates of Samogitia made threats against the life of the Grand Duke and his family and that there were also external Russian threats should he accept the Roman rite:[14]

""It is for this that the king renounced the faith to the point that he no longer dared to utter a word about baptism.""

Following the death of Peter of Moscow in 1326, Theophilus and a candidate presented by Moscow were rejected by Constantinople as too political for the Metropolis of Kiev.[11] Instead, the patriarch appointed an independent person -Theognostus - as the new Metropolitan.

When Theophilus died in 1329, Theognostus succeeded in restoring unity in the Rus' by claiming that there were too few Christians in pagan Lithuania.[15] The seat of the metropolis was left vacant.[16] In the meantime, Theognostus had authority over all Rus' and Lithuania until his own death in 1353. For two years, the see was again vacant.

Following a civil war, Algirdas was acknowledged as the new Grand Duke of Lithuania. Having increased the territorial extent of the state in the south, he was in a stronger position to advocate for the restoration of metropolis. In 1360, he deposed Theodore who was the last ethnic Rus' prince of Kiev. In his place, he placed his own son, Vladimir, on the throne.[17]

After the death of Theognostus in 1353, Algirdas did not at first attempt to revive the Metropolitanate of Lithuania. Instead, he promoted his own candidate - Teodoryt - to the see of Kiev and All Rus'. When Teodoryt failed to gain support in the Ecumenical Patriarchate, he turned to the schismatic Bulgarian Orthodox Church and received ordination there.[18] Such actions may indicate that Algirdas envisioned an autocephalous church of his own.[19] In any case, Theognostus' favoured candidate — Alexius — was consecrated as Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus' in 1354.

Algirdas now changed his support from Teodoryt to Roman. Roman was a monk from Tver and a relative of Algirdas' wife Uliana. Algirdas agreed to cease his support for Teodoryt on the grounds that his ordination was uncanonical, on condition that Roman was also appointed as Metropolitan of All Rus'. Algirdas even promised to convert to Orthodoxy in exchange for the ordination of Roman.[20] In Constantinople, Patriarch Callistus I was deposed and was succeeded by Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople (November 1353 – 1354).

In 1355, after diplomatic struggles, a restored Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople, in agreement with Philotheus, united the Metropolis of Halych with the Metropolis of Lithuania under the leadership of Metropolitan Roman. Callistus also confirmed that Alexius remained in possession of the ""Metropolis of Kiev and all Rus'"".[21] All eparchies of the Halych metropolis were transferred to the jurisdiction of a united metropolis, which was also known as the ""Metropolis of Lithuania-Volhynia"".

There were now two metropolitans in Rus' lands. While Roman won over some bishops, he failed to secure the support of the Bishop of Tver. The ecclesiastical authorities of Constantinople did not take any measures to delineate the powers of the two metropolitans; neither did they assign any particular diocese of the old Rus' metropolis to the new metropolis of Lithuania-Volhynia. As a result, Roman began to claim that he ruled not only the dioceses of Lithuania-Volhynia, but also those of the entire Rus' metropolis. The ensuing struggle between the two metropolitans continued until Roman's death in 1362.[22]

Both Metropolitans travelled to Constantinople to make their appeals in person. In 1356, their cases were heard by a Patriarchal Synod.[23] The Holy Synod confirmed that Alexis was the Metropolitan of Kiev while Roman was also confirmed in his see at Novogorodek. In 1361, the two sees were formally divided. Shortly afterwards, in the winter of 1361/62, Roman died. From 1362 to 1371, the vacant see of Lithuania–Halych was administered by Alexius. By that point, the Lithuanian metropolis was effectively dissolved.

Following the disestablishment of Roman’s see, the territory of Lithuania was officially lowered to the rank of a bishopric. It was placed under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus'.[21] While the senior clergy of the Orthodox Church in Moscow asserted that the territory of the Grand Duchy was within their canonical scope, they made little attempt to evangelise the territory. No Orthodox missionaries were sent to work among the Lithuanians. The common folk were unwilling to embrace Christianity. Given the support of paganism among the nobility, the royal family was unwilling to alienate them by granting approval for Orthodox missionaries to operate in the state. In any case, following the predations of the Mongol invasion, large parts of the countryside were underpopulated and Kiev itself was uninhabitable for a considerable period of time. This explains why the metropolitan see moved to Vladimir. Monks and other clergy also moved to the north to escape the intrusions of the Mongol overlords. No notable monastery was located in lands controlled by  the Lithuanians.

Algirdas interpreted the dissolution as an insult to himself and to the Lithuanian state. In 1371, he again attempted to erect a separate Lithuanian metropolis. He wrote to the Patriarch strongly condemning Alexius of neglecting his flock in Lithuanian areas. He also accused Alexius of being more interested in politics than in religion:[24]

""Such metropolitans we did not have in the days of our forefathers. He blesses the Muscovites to slaughter, but never comes to us. And to Kiev he does not come . . .the metropolitan should bless the Muscovites that they help us as we are fighting for them against the Germans. We invite him, but he never comes. Give us another metropolitan for Kiev, Smolensk, Tver, Little Russia, Novoselsk, and Nizhni Novgorod.""

Constantinople replied with an ironic reference to Algirdas' being the king of ""fire-worshippers"" (i.e. still a pagan). Nevertheless, the point was carried, and Algirdas' intervention was successful in raising his own candidate — Cyprian — to the throne.

On 2 December 1375, at the Holy Council in Constantinople, Philotheus, who had been restored to the patriarchy, ordained Cyprian as ""Metropolitan of Kiev, Russia and Lithuania"", but with the condition that after the death of the elderly Metropolitan Alexius, he would become the metropolitan of Kiev and all Rus' and unite the entire metropolis under his authority.[25][26]

On 12 February 1376, Alexius died; by the terms of the agreement with the patriarch, Cyprian was entitled to rule the religious affairs of all Rus'. On 6 June 1376, Cyprian arrived at his residence in Kiev. He attempted, but failed, to get recognition of his rights in the whole metropolitan diocese from the Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitri Donskoi, Novgorod, and Pskov. However, in the same year, there was a palace mutiny in Constantinople in which power was usurped by Andronikos IV. The new emperor deposed Patriarch Philotheus and installed Macarius in his stead. Macarius assured Dmitriy of Moscow in writing that he denied Cyprian's claims to the Church of Great Rus. He also offered to send the Grand Duke's nominee — Mitya — to Constantinople for his consecration as metropolitan.[27] Mitya, however, died (1379) within sight of Constantinople.[27]: 218  Mitya was accompanied by Pimen. The succeeding Patriarch — Nilus — may have been tricked by Pimen using forged letters into consecrating Pimen in Mitya's place in June 1380.[27]: 219–220

As a result, Cyprian's rights to the united metropolis was disputed by Pimen (1380–1382). Dmitry, upon hearing the news of Pimen's consecration, angrily swore not to accept Pimen upon his return. Thus Pimen's metropolitanate was contested from the start, and he accomplished little as a result.  Cyprian's rights were also disputed by Dionysius (1384–1385). Dionysius died in detention in Kiev on 15 October 15, 1385. After this, Cyprian enjoyed undisputed leadership of the Church throughout the Rus' and Lithuanian lands. He died in 1406.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_of_Lithuania
Vilnius Region under Lithuanian administration (1939–1940),"As a result of the German-Soviet Invasion of Poland part of Vilnius Region was under Lithuanian administration in the period lasting from the takeover of the city from the occupying Soviet administration on October 27, 1939, to the occupation of all of Lithuania including Vilnius on June 15, 1940.[1]

As a result of the Polish-Lithuanian conflict of 1919–1920, and the Polish-Soviet war of 1919–1921, Vilnius and the surrounding region became part of Poland. Lithuania claimed the region, still considering Vilnius as its historical and constitutional capital. The strained relations between the two countries did not improve until 1938. In the following year, however, Poland became the victim of a joint German-Soviet invasion in September 1939; as a result of the defeat, its territory was divided between the two occupiers. Lithuania didn't join the invasion, but on 19 September 1939 reminded of its right to Vilnius. The Soviets offered Lithuania to cede Vilnius and the Vilnius region in return for placing their military bases on its territory.

The Lithuanians agreed to this proposal. The transfer of Vilnius which was completed on 27 October 1939 was celebrated as an act of historical justice, even though it meant a de facto loss of sovereignty. It also led to the severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile, which regarded Lithuanian rule as an occupation. Lithuania opted against an immediate relocation of its capital to Vilnius, instead, embarking on a policy of Lithuanization, that had a negative impact on the Polish population who made up the majority of the population of the incorporated territory. Particularly the closure of all Polish organisations and the withdrawal of civil rights from a population that Lithuania considered foreign. Despite these measures, the Polish population regarded Lithuanian rule as more favourable than the terror perpetrated by the Germans and Soviets in their respective occupation zones.

In June 1940, the Soviets demanded that Lithuania form a friendly government and allow Soviet troops into the entire territory of the state. This act meant the complete loss of sovereignty and the de facto occupation of the whole of Lithuania by the Soviet Union.

After the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Lithuania was pressured by German diplomacy to enter Vilnius. Despite the idea's popularity among the Lithuanian public, the Lithuanian government rejected it.[2] German pressure ceased on September 16.[2] A day later, The USSR began its aggression against Poland and the borders were crossed by the Red Army, which occupied Vilnius on the night of September 18–19, after fighting the Polish Army units defending the city. Vilnius became the unofficial capital of Western Belarus, and a brief period of Belarusization began for the region, which the Belorussian Communists believed would soon be incorporated into Soviet Belarus.

On September 19, Lithuanian envoy in Moscow Ladas Natkevičius claimed Lithuanian rights to Vilnius.[3] After the new German-Soviet border was established on September 28, the Soviets invited the Lithuanians to talks. Negotiations lasted from October 3 to 10. The result of the talks was the ""Treaty on Mutual Assistance and Transfer of Vilnius and Vilnius Region to Lithuania,"" under which, in exchange for Vilnius, Lithuania agreed to establish Soviet military bases on its territory.[4] The treaty was ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas on October 14.[4] Lithuanian diplomats had no doubt that the presence of Soviet troops meant preparation for annexation. During negotiations, the Soviets threatened the possibility of annexing Vilnius to Soviet Belarus, and even the possibility of reconstituting the Lithuanian-Belarusian SSR.[5] In addition, Lithuania received only a fragment of territory that had been recognized by Soviet Russia as part of Lithuania under the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of July 12, 1920.[6] Lithuania annexed most of Wilno-Troki County with Vilnius, half of Święciany County, and parts of Grodno, Lida, Oszmiany and Brasław counties.[6] Soviet troops remained in Lithuanian-ruled Vilnius region, deploying in Naujoji Vilnia, Gaižiūnai, Prienai and Alytus.[7]

Polish envoy in Kaunas Franciszek Charwat submitted a protest note on behalf of the Polish government.[8] The Lithuanian side responded that Vilnius was and is an inseparable part of Lithuania, which Poland occupied since 1920.[9] According to Polish military attaché Leon Mitkiewicz-Żołłtek [pl], the Lithuanians' response was even harsher, they were to state that they did not recognize the Polish government in Paris and for them Poland ceased to exist.[9] In response, Charwat left Lithuania, thus breaking off Polish-Lithuanian relations.[10] Michał Römer (Mykolas Römeris), a Lithuanian specialist in international law and rector of University of Kaunas, argued that Lithuania had not violated Poland's sovereignty because it had taken over its capital peacefully, from the state under whose administration it was temporarily located. He argued that, from the Lithuanian point of view, Poland had never acquired the right to possess Vilnius, so in view of this, Lithuania remained neutral with respect to Poland.[10] On October 18, 1939, the Polish government lodged a formal protest to the government of Lithuania and other countries with which it had diplomatic relations against Lithuania's takeover of Vilnius.[9]

The Lithuanian public generally welcomed the news of the annexation of Vilnius with enthusiasm, and there were mass demonstrations in the streets of Kaunas.[11] Left-leaning journalist Justas Paleckis gave a gratitude speech toward the Soviet Union, in which he demanded freedom for political prisoners and the resignation of President Smetona; for this he was sent to the Dimitravas forced labour camp.[12] However, most of the better politically oriented Lithuanian intelligentsia realized that this was only a prelude to the occupation of Lithuania by Soviet forces.[13]

Throughout the interwar period, official propaganda for the recapture of Vilnius built up an image of Vilnius as a country suffering poverty and backwardness under Polish rule; this impression was compounded by the ongoing hostilities. As a result, there were initiatives in Lithuania to send humanitarian aid to Vilnius, and an official proclamation issued on October 13 called for this. The director of the Kaunas State Theater, Antanas Juška, headed the Relief Committee for the Vilnius Country.[12]

On October 19, the Soviet Workers' Guard was disbanded. As early as October 22, Lithuanian flags appeared on buildings in Vilnius, and the first Lithuanian officials also arrived in the city and began forming a Lithuanian militia.[14] Soviet units were leaving the city, carrying out looting. In addition, about 3,000 Jewish residents of the city were allowed to leave for the depths of the USSR - mainly those previously involved in the formation of the foundations of Soviet power.[14]

Lithuanian troops crossed the Polish-Lithuanian border in several places. The main route of the march led from Kaunas through the border crossing at Zawiasy, where the barrier was ceremoniously sawed through and border wreaths were burned.[6] On October 28, Lithuanian army units, commanded by Vincas Vitkauskas, entered Vilnius.[15] The encroaching troops were welcomed by delegations of Vilnius Lithuanians, Byelorussians, Tatars, Jews, and Polish Krajowcy.[16] The parade in the city was recorded on color film. Volunteers were brought in from Kaunas Lithuania to form a cheering crowd in honor of the Lithuanian army.[17][18]

Polish residents of the city greeted the Lithuanian army with indifference, and sometimes with interest. The general feeling was that Lithuanian rule in Vilnius would be short-lived.[16] There was also a prevailing sense of relief at the end of the Soviet occupation, during which 348 people were arrested and deported, among them political leaders and university professors.[17] Polish Archbishop of Vilnius Romuald Jałbrzykowski refused to greet Lithuanian troops by ringing bells, and during his sermon called the Lithuanians the next occupiers.[19] The very next day, a Polish patriotic demonstration was organized, attended by about 700-800 people; it was dispersed by the police.[20]

The actual demography of the region, and especially the ethnic breakdown, is difficult to determine. Mainly because the area that began to be ruled by Lithuania went across the Polish administrative division, so that Polish statistics from the 1931 census cannot be a direct basis for making estimates. Undoubtedly, the Polish population dominated in and around Vilnius, while the Lithuanian population was in the minority, grouped in the southwestern slice of Wilno-Troki County and parts of Święciany County.[21] The areas of pre-war Poland, where the concentration of Lithuanian population was greatest, were outside the Lithuanian administration.[22]

In Vilnius alone, the number of Lithuanians ranged between 1.4 and 7 thousand.[23] This number, as a result of immigration from Kaunas, has risen to 30-40 thousand.[24] Making an accurate estimate is also prevented by population shifts related to the war effort.[16] In Vilnius alone, at the end of October 1939, there were 18,000-20,000 refugees, half of whom were Jews.[25]

Two Lithuanian researchers, Leonas Sabaliūnas and Regina Žepkaitė [lt], have made their own estimates of the demography of the area ruled by Lithuania, which differ significantly.[21][26]

The Vilnius region was hit quite hard by the hostilities and the month-long Soviet occupation. There were many refugees from other regions of Poland, unemployment was rising, and rising food prices were also a problem. The Lithuanian government made an effort to relieve the major problems plaguing the region. In the fall of 1939, a mandatory loan of 50 million litas was dispersed to Vilnius. It was charged to civil servants' salaries, as well as income tax payers. By the end of April, the budget had received 30.1 million litas from it.[27] This allowed the budget of the city of Vilnius to be set at 28.5 million litas, which exceeded the pre-war Polish budget; this was heavily emphasized by the Lithuanian press.[27] Additional funds were used to invest in urban infrastructure.

Less successful was the fight against unemployment. At the beginning of December 1939, there were 8815 unemployed people in Vilnius, later the number only increased.[27] This was caused by the paralysis of industry related to the loss of markets, this was equally true for all of Lithuania, whose trade had collapsed due to the outbreak of war.[27] The reason was also the deliberate activity of the Lithuanian authorities to close Polish enterprises and cooperatives and replace them with Lithuanian ones.[28]

Poverty began to prevail in the city. The authorities estimated the number of people in need of permanent support at 150,000, but they themselves were able to provide assistance to 25,000, the Red Cross to a further 27,000.[29] When distributing aid, the Lithuanian authorities preferred groups considered loyal, thus aid was directed primarily to the Lithuanian population, followed by members of the Belarusian and Jewish minorities.[27] Very little aid was given to Polish Army reservists.[29]

Lithuanian policy toward the peasants was much friendlier, and efforts were made to win them over, primarily through land reform. This was also aimed at weakening the Polish landed gentry.[30] A significant concession was their exemption from taxation for the second half of 1939.[30] However, the land reform was very limited in scope, covering only estates of more than 150 hectares, of which there were not many in Vilnius (about 114),[30] primarily the estates of the Sołtans and Tyszkiewiczs. In total, the acreage subject to reform was less than 20,000 hectares. The expropriation proceeded very slowly, in principle only forest areas were covered.[30] When receiving land, priority was given to Lithuanian army volunteers from Vilnius, as well as those persecuted by the Polish government for their Lithuanian activities during the interwar.[30] The symbol of the failure of the land reform was the expropriation of 185 hectares of the Andrzejowo estate, which belonged to Gen. Lucjan Żeligowski. This was presented in the press as an act of historical justice. In fact, immediately after the expropriation, the property was leased to Żeligowski's brother-in-law Petras Kaziunas, married to his sister Maria.[31]

Although the Lithuanian authorities treated Vilnius as their state's legitimate capital, for fear of unrest in the city, they decided not to immediately transfer all offices from Kaunas. Vilnius was transformed into a special administrative unit headed by a commissioner of the Lithuanian government.[23] The first of these was Antanas Merkys, who spoke Polish well and made some conciliatory decisions toward Poles (including approval for the resumption of the Polish press and the establishment of the Polish Committee), but his successor, Kazys Bizauskas, advocated a stricter policy toward Poles.[32]

According to the Lithuanian government, the primary goal during the transition period was to be the full Lithuanianization of Vilnius, by which was meant the full domination of Lithuanians in political and cultural life.[33] At the outset, the idea of granting autonomous status to Vilnius was rejected, as this would not have been accepted by public opinion, as well as the German and Soviet governments.[33] The Lithuanian intelligentsia was divided into two camps. The moderate party grouped around the magazine Naujoji Romuva advocated gradual Lithuanianization, the introduction of extensive land reform, and tolerance for the non-Lithuanian population.[34] On the other wing was the nationalist party with its organ Vairas, which advocated immediate Lithuanianization and exclusion of the Polish population from public life. Both parties shared the view that the majority of Vilnius residents were Lithuanians who had lost their national consciousness, undergoing Polonization, but racially belonged to the Lithuanian nation.[34][35] Even the moderate wing called for separating war refugees and newcomers who appeared in Vilnius after 1920 from the local Polish community, deeming those impossible to ""relithuanianization"".[36]

The Nationalist Union, ruling Lithuania in an authoritarian manner, was closer to the latter option. President Antanas Smetona himself declared that the state's task was to make Vilnius ""more Lithuanian,"" but he was under a lot of internal pressure from national circles.[37] Moreover, the conviction of the final nature of the border changes and that even if Poland was to be restored after the war, it would not encompass the eastern territories encouraged them to take a hard line. Also crucial were the transformations made by the Germans in the Polish territories: the destruction of any signs of Polish autonomy and the creation of the General Government; Germany also pressured Lithuania to take a hard line against the Poles.[38]

One of the first decisions of the Lithuanian authorities, on October 30, was to forcibly exchange Polish currency for Lithuanian, at an unfavorable rate of 5 to 1.[20] This triggered further increases in food prices, which in turn led to more protests in the city, this time organized by leftist circles. The next day the protests continued from the morning, with pro-Soviet slogans appearing. The protesters were opposed by Endecja aligned militias. The situation turned into an anti-Jewish pogrom, which ended only with the intervention of Lithuanian police and the Soviet army. During the pogrom, 200 stores, houses and apartments were damaged, about 200 people were battered, 22 severely.[39]

The next day, All Saints' Day (November 1), there were more demonstrations, and a demonstration of several thousand at the Ross cemetery. On All Souls' Day (November 2), there was another demonstration of 20,000 Poles, this time legal, but which also escalated into clashes with the police.[40] Similar demonstrations also took place in other towns in the region, including Naujoji Vilnia, Maišiagala, and Lentvaris.[41]

The result of the demonstration was the decision to reduce the currency exchange rate to a ratio of 2 to 1.[41] Lithuanian propaganda tried to exploit the anti-Jewish incidents by portraying Poles as fierce anti-Semites and making concessions to the Jewish population, including the introduction of Yiddish broadcasts on Vilnius radio.[42]

On 27 October, the Law on Citizenship of the Residents of Vilnius and Vilnius Region was passed. The law recognised as ""aliens"" (Lithuanian: Svetimšalis), which were deprived of the civil rights, all persons who were not able to prove that at the age of 18 they had lived in Lithuania within the 1939 borders on 12 July 1920 (the date of the signing of the Lithuanian-Soviet Peace Treaty)[43]) and on 27 October 1939.[44] The problem with the law was that it concerned two specific dates, and because both fell within the period of warfare, many people were unable to provide proper evidence.[44] The law provided facilities for acquiring citizenship for persons who did not meet these conditions, but claimed to be Lithuanian nationals or were ""meritorious to Lithuania"".[45]

The process of granting citizenship began on 30 November 1939.[46] ""Aliens"" had their freedom of movement restricted (they could only leave their place of residence for 7 days with the permission of the local police station),[24] they were deprived of the right to engage in wage labour, with the exception of agriculture, belonging to social organisations, practising medicine or law, running pharmacies, bookshops or publishing houses, working in public offices, owning property, and even talking in public places.[47][48][24] A severe restriction was preventing relatives who found themselves under German occupation from being brought to Vilnius region.[24] The Lithuanian authorities also refused to pay pensions and allowances to foreigners, despite the seizure of huge assets accumulated by the Polish Universal Mutual Insurance Company.[49] These restrictions were aimed at inducing Poles to leave Vilnius or declare Lithuanian nationality.

Out of Vilnius' population of 200,000, only 30,000-40,000 were granted citizenship.[50] In May 1940, there were 97,893 ""aliens"" in the Vilnius region, of whom 87,616 were in Vilnius.[51] Those who managed to maintain their citizenship were forced to indicate their Lithuanian nationality in their passports and to Lithuanianise their names.[46] The Lithuanian government also attempted the removal of ""aliens"" and refugees from the city and by the start of the Soviet occupation, had succeeded in removing 5,220 people, including 1,975 Poles and 3,425 Jews.[48]

The incidents of the early days of the Lithuanian administration resulted in a tougher stance by the Lithuanian authorities, which took the form of an accelerated and forced Lithuanization. The Lithuanian language was made compulsory in offices and workplaces.[47] Clerks who do not speak the language have been dismissed.[44] As part of this process, street names, signboards, advertisements and school curricula were replaced with Lithuanian ones, and Polish emblems were removed. By the decision of the Lithuanian authorities, all Polish provisions and laws ceased to be valid on 27 October 1939, and the country became subject to Lithuanian law.[1]

In practice, this meant the liquidation of all organisations which, in Lithuanian interpretation, operated under foreign law. As a result, 202 Polish organisations (including Stefan Batory University[1]), 176 Jewish i 4 Belarusian became illegal.[44] Trade unions were also abolished in this way, and in their place the Lithuanian government established corporate labour chambers, modelled on the fascist ones. From then on, the trade unions operated semi-legally, but this also came to an end with the preventive arrest of trade union leaders just before 1 May 1940.[52]

The Lithuanian authorities had an aversive attitude towards Archbishop Romuald Jałbrzykowski, who was accused of Polish nationalism and the Polonisation of the Church in Lithuania.[53] The authorities tried to the Holy See to have Jałbrzykowski removed from his position and Vilnius incorporated into the Lithuanian ecclesiastical province, but their efforts failed.[54]

In the spring of 1940, the Lithuanian authorities tried to introduce the Lithuanian language into the churches, resulting in another wave of riots and clashes with the police.[55] In addition, groups of Lithuanian students provoked incidents in churches where Polish masses were celebrated, jamming the service with loud singing of religious songs in Lithuanian.[56] The Polish Committee stood up for Polish rights in the churches, but its intervention was ignored.[1] Inspired by the Polish underground, a silent anti-Lithuanian demonstration took place in Vilnius on 15 May.[55] Lithuanian pressure eventually led to the introduction of services in Lithuanian in the more important churches of Vilnius.[56]

During the period of Lithuanian rule, the Polish population was able to enjoy a certain freedom in cultural life, e.g. in autumn 1939, the publication of the Kurier Wileński (Vilnius Courier) and Gazeta Codzienna (Daily Newspaper) was resumed, as well as the distribution of the Kaunas-based Chata Rodzinna (Family Cottage) and Dzień Polski (Polish Day).[55] Polish films were screened in cinemas, which was met with outrage by Lithuanian nationalist circles.[57] On 11 November 1939, celebrations of the Polish Independence Day also took place, although their nature was limited by the orders of the Lithuanian authorities.[58] There were also Polish theatres in Vilnius, where refugees from areas occupied by the Third Reich and the USSR also performed, and new books by Polish authors were sold and even published.[59] On the other hand, in February 1940, under the pretext of saving paper, the Kaunas weekly magazines Głos Młodych and Chata Rodzinna were closed down.[60] At the beginning of 1940, the Lithuanian press began to criticise the existence of Polish theatre, which led to the closure of some of them.[59]

In Lithuanian-administered territories, there were 46 kindergartens, 486 primary schools, 23 gymnasia, 17 secondary schools, 5 teachers' schools, 26 vocational schools and 2 Polish universities.[21] Due to the war and the Soviet occupation, many schools were deprived of teachers, and the Lithuanian government also decided to immediately dismiss half of the Polish teaching staff. Their place was taken by Lithuanians, often with low qualifications. There was also a gradual replacement of the Polish language by Lithuanian.[61] The number of Polish language lessons in schools was reduced, Lithuanian language and history and geography of Lithuania were introduced.[62]

This led to a protest by Polish schoolchildren on 3–6 December 1939. The result was the removal of around 200 students from schools and the dismissal of 11 teachers.[62] This did not stop the conflicts in schools, which actually lasted until the start of the Soviet occupation.[62]

On 15 December 1939, Stefan Batory University in Vilnius was closed down. By June 1940, the majority of Polish gymnasia and pro-gymnasia had also been liquidated, and gymnasia operating in pre-war Lithuania were closed down. Primary schools survived the liquidation operation better.[63] The Polish university was replaced by the Lithuanian university, which became operational in January 1940, with Ignas Končius [lt] as its rector. The two faculties, humanities and law, which were transferred from Kaunas University, had 1,061 students.[64] The new institution aimed to educate the new Lithuanian intelligentsia of Vilnius and cadres for Lithuanian offices.[65]

According to the Lithuanian constitution, Vilnius was the capital from the moment of the creation of the state, while Kaunas performed this function only temporarily. After the annexation of Vilnius, Vilnius did not assume the function of a proper capital at once, the process was gradual and not completed until Lithuania lost its independence. The first step towards this was the external Lithuanization of the city: the removal of Polish signs, inscriptions, local names, Polish uniforms of public service employees.[66]

An important step towards giving the city a Lithuanian appearance was to change the names of the streets. Initially, the plan was to simply translate most of the names into Lithuanian, but eventually the option to change the names and patrons of most streets prevailed. Names clearly associated with Poland were changed, so Lucjan Żeligowski Street was renamed to Klaipėda Street, Józef Piłsudski Street to Algirdas Street, and 3th May Street to 16th February Street. A symbolically significant change was the renaming of the city's main artery, Mickiewicz Street, to Gediminas Street.[67] One of the streets in Žvėrynas (Ziwerzyniec) district has been named after Mickiewicz.[68] One of the few names that remained was Antoni Wiwulski Street. By the beginning of May 1940, 490 streets had been renamed; the names of the remaining 153 streets, 12 markets, 13 squares, 11 cemeteries and 5 mountains had been changed by the end of the Lithuanian rule.[67]

Many central celebrations were organised in the city to emphasise the capital's character. On 10 December 1939, the Congress of Commanders of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union was organised in Vilnius, which gathered about 1,000 participants.[56] On 1 June 1940, the Congress of Mayors of Lithuanian Cities was held in Vilnius, highlighting the transfer of leadership of Lithuanian cities from Kaunas to Vilnius.[69] On 29–30 June 1940, a festival of Lithuanian art was organised in Vilnius to begin the programme to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the death of Grand Duke Gediminas, the founder of Vilnius.[70]

On 2 June 1940, the office of the Commissar of the Government of Lithuania was abolished and the incorporation of Vilnius into the system of Lithuanian administration began, but these activities were interrupted by the annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union.[69]

Polish society tried to oppose the repressive actions of the Lithuanian government.[71] The semi-official representation of Polish society became the Polish Committee, headed by Bolesław Krzyżanowski, which was approved by Antanas Merkys on 6 November 1939.[71] The Committee conducted its activities openly. However, it had limited capacities, its activities were basically limited to sending resolutions and protests to the Lithuanian local and central authorities, which were, mostly ignored.[71] The Polish Committee included representatives of science and culture, as well as representatives of the main political parties: Maciej Dobrzański from the PPS, Aleksander Zwierzyński from the National Party and Witold Staniewicz representing the Sanacja camp.[71]

Society's response to the Lithuanization of education and the closure of Polish schools and universities was the organisation of secret teaching. The closure of the Stefan Batory University on 15 December 1939 did not put an end to its activities; the University Senate, headed by Rector Stefan Ehrenkreutz [pl], continued to meet secretly, and lectures and examinations were held. At the beginning of 1940, an Aid Committee for former university employees was organised, headed by Stefan Kempisty.[72]

From the very beginning of the Lithuanian administration, secret political and military organisations began emerging. One of the first was the Government Commissariat, founded in Vilnius at the turn of September and October 1939, by Rajmund Gostkowski and Bronisław Świątnicki. It was an anti-Sanation organisation, with a peasant orientation. Contrary to its name, it had no contacts with the government-in-exile, but only with the Polish missions in Kaunas and Riga.[73] At the head was an unknown commander with the pseudonym ""Jołan"" (probably it was Gostkowski). The Department B (intelligence) was commanded by Zygmunt Sroczyński, the Military Department by Antoni Olechnowicz ""Meteor"". The organisation was being investigated by the Lithuanian police. It had up to 400 members.[74]

On the basis of the military units stationed in the Vilnius region, as well as those interned in Lithuania, underground Regimental Circles began to be formed. They were headed by Lt. Col. Adam Obtułowicz ""Leon"". The main aim of the Circles was to organise help and support for soldiers, organise escape routes to the west and continue the fight for Poland's freedom. The Civil Commissioner by the commandant was Józef Święcicki.[75] There was also a youth organisation attached to the Regimental Circle, headed by Major Władysław Zarzycki 'Rojan'.[76]

The Union of Free Poles was founded on the night of 17–18 September 1939 on the basis of the pre-war League of Free Poles, as its armed arm; it was a synarchic organisation based on Christian doctrine. It was headed by student Jan Kazimierz Mackiewicz; its sympathiser and protector was Lt Col Edward Perkowicz. Mackiewicz adopted the pseudonym ""Konrad"" and became the group's commander.[76]

The Union of Independence Fighters was founded on 18 October 1939, on the 18th anniversary of the founding of the 13th Vilnius Scout Troop, as a scout conspiracy. It was headed by scoutmaster Józef Grzesiak ""Czarny"".

Associated with the National Democracy was the National Military Organisation (NOW), which was formed after the Lithuanians entered Vilnius. The commander of NOW was Modest Gramz ""Maurycy"". The organisation soon joined the ranks of the mainstream Service for Poland's Victory.[77] The ONR-Falanga milieu founded the Military Organisation of the Fighting Nation, as early as September 1939, headed by Antoni Rymaszewski.[78]

A smaller Sanacja associated organization was the Committee for Struggle for Liberation founded at the end of September 1939 by Major Władysław Kamiński ""Śliwa"".[79] Witold Staniewicz led the other Sanacja associated organisation: Independence Camp.[79] The Organisation of Fighting Poland was a fairly strong organisation in Vilnius; it was involved in propaganda and was distinguished by the radio station it owned, from which broadcasts were made under the name Radio Wolność (Freedom).[80]

The Polish Socialist Party had two clandestine organisations in Vilnius: the Socialist Fighting Organisation and the Socialist-Independentist Organisation ""Freedom"". Both subordinated themselves at the beginning of 1940 to the Service for Poland's Victory.[81] The Catholic-Socialist organisation was People's Action, led by Father Henryk Hlebowicz.[81]

The largest secret youth organisation was the Young Eagles.[82] The women's organisation, organised by female activists of the Polish Military Organisation, was led by Jadwiga Łukaszewiczowa.[83]

At the turn of November and December 1939, the Provincial Command of the Service for Poland's Victory (SZP) was established, to be headed by Colonel Janusz Gaładyk ""Strzała"", who had arrived from Warsaw, but was arrested by the Lithuanian police and imprisoned in Kaunas Fort VI.[84] Thanks to the mediation of Father Kazimierz Kucharski, the Regimental Circles were incorporated into the SZP, and their commander Lt. Col. Obtułowicz became the provincial commander of the SZP in Vilnius.[85] However, Obtułowicz was unpopular as being associated with the Sanacja regime, and his place was taken by Lt Col Nikodem Sulik. These changes were accepted by the headquarters in Warsaw.[85]

In early June, the USSR issued an ultimatum to Lithuania demanding the formation of a friendly government and the freedom of its troops to stay on Lithuanian territory. In practice, this meant the full annexation of Lithuania by the USSR. The Lithuanian government accepted the terms of the ultimatum on the night of 14–15 June. One of the last decisions of the Lithuanian government before the occupation of Lithuania by the USSR was an order of 14 June 1940, by which the Minister of Education ordered the closure of two out of three Polish secondary schools in the Kaunas region and the liquidation of all eight primary schools.[86]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius_Region_under_Lithuanian_administration_(1939–1940)
Lithuanian Historical Society,"The Lithuanian Historical Society (Lithuanian: Lietuvos istorijos draugija) was a society of Lithuanian historians established in 1929 in Kaunas. It was the first society dedicated to history in Lithuania and was a sign of historians becoming more professional. It sought to improve historical research and historical publications,[1] but was not very active. It published only two volumes of its journal Praeitis (The Past). It ceased activities after the Soviet occupation in June 1940. The society was reestablished during the Glasnost reforms and was active in 1988–2001.

The founding meeting of the society took place on 18 May 1929 in the apartment of Augustinas Janulaitis who was the driving force of the society and its long-term chairman.[2] Janulaitis was a member of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and attempted to establish its history section in 1920, but these efforts failed.[3] The Lithuanian Historical Society identified four key areas of activities: organizing lectures, conferences, meetings; publishing journals, books, etc.; gathering sources on the history of Lithuania; and cooperating internationally.[2]

The society became a member of the International Committee of Historical Sciences in 1931.[4] Two society members (Janulaitis and Zenonas Ivinskis) participated at the 8th International Congress of Historical Sciences in Zürich in 1938.[3] The society was also invited to contribute to the annual International Bibliography of Historical Sciences, but the response was sluggish.[3]

The society and all of its members (except for Peliksas Bugailiškis [lt] who was from Šiauliai) were based in Kaunas. To expand its reach beyond Kaunas,[1] it established a section for history teachers in 1938. It grew to about 60 members, but they did not become the true members of the Lithuanian Historical Society.[5]

The society became less active after the Institute for Lithuanian Studies was founded in 1939 and took over most of the functions of the society.[2] The society ceased activities after the Soviet occupation in June 1940. Most of the members were either arrested or deported by the Soviets, or fled from Lithuania at the end of World War II.[6] Historians who immigrated to the United States established the Lithuanian Historical Society (Lietuvių istorijos draugija) which was active in 1956–1989.[7]

The society organized various lectures and events. For example, it organized exhibitions for the 500th death anniversary of Grand Duke Vytautas and the 20th anniversary of the Act of Independence of Lithuania.[1] However, the society felt that it should work on academic studies and historical facts, and did not focus on public or popular history.[1] The society discussed various current developments and initiatives. Particularly lively discussions were held concerning one-volume book on the history of Lithuania edited by Adolfas Šapoka.[6] The older generation of historians argued that specialized monographs on specific topics should be published first before a synthesis could be made. The younger historians did not want to wait and argued that there was a great need for such a book.[6]

The society established academic journal Praeitis and planned to publish it twice a year,[8] but only two volumes of 400 and 514 pages were actually published in 1930 and 1933.[3] The journal was edited by Janulaitis and administered by Konstantinas Jablonskis [lt]. Most articles were about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The journal also included publications of historical sources, reviews of books and publications, bibliography, and obituaries of noted historians.[8] In 1936, Zenonas Ivinskis and Adolfas Šapoka – historians of the younger generation – proposed to revive and modernize the journal based on the examples of German Historische Zeitschrift or Polish Kwartalnik Historyczny, however it was not accomplished.[2]

The society also planned to publish a book series Praeities biblioteka.[1] However, only three books were published:[7]

Despite its lackluster activity, the society was influential in the community of Lithuanian historians.[3]

Zigmantas Kiaupa, Ingė Lukšaitė, and Egidijus Aleksandravičius [lt] initiated the restoration of the society in 1988.[3] 89 historians attended the founding meeting held on 14 October 1988.[6] The society published academic journal Mūsų praeitis (seven volumes in 1990–2001). It paid significant attention to research conducted by the interwar and émigré historians.[3] The society also finalized and published the third volume of Praeitis (1992) which was started by the interwar society. The publication also included biographies of all historians who had published articles in Praeitis.[3]

The society organized six general meetings as well as various conferences and lectures.[7] For example, it organized an international conference for the 580th anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald. Its proceedings were published in the first volume of Acta Historica Universitatis Klaipedensis published by Klaipėda University in 1993.[9] It also organized essay contests for children and adults.[6]

Its section for history teachers became a separate organization in 1992. The Lithuanian Historical Society became inactive in 2001. Its functions were taken over by the Committee of Lithuanian Historians [lt] established in 1996.[7]

Members of the society were divided into categories: true members (professional historians), honorary members (people who made merited contribution to the study of the history of Lithuania), and supporters.[7] Therefore, the interwar society was never large and had between 15[10] and 17 members.[2] In total, there were 26 true members in the interwar period.[11]

Augustinas Janulaitis was chairman of the society until 1940. Other board members included Ignas Jonynas (vice-chair), Vaclovas Biržiška (librarian), Petras Tarasenka and Konstantinas Avižonis [lt] (treasurers), Konstantinas Jablonskis [lt] (secretary).[2]

Other society members included Lev Karsavin, Jonas Yčas [lt], Jonas Totoraitis, Petras Klimas, Zenonas Ivinskis, Adolfas Šapoka, Vytautas Steponaitis [lt], Jonas Matusas [lt], Antanas Vasys-Vasiliauskas [lt], Marija Mašiotaitė-Urbšienė [lt], Vanda Daugirdaitė-Sruogienė,[2] Paulius Galaunė, Juozas Tumas, Eduards Volters, Jonas Puzinas, Aleksandras Pliateris [lt], Mykolas Biržiška, Vaclovas Biržiška, Michał Pius Römer, Peliksas Bugailiškis [lt].[3]

The reestablished society had 141 members in December 1989.[3] Chairmen of the reestablished society were Bronius Dundulis [lt], Antanas Tyla [lt], Vytautas Merkys, Elmantas Meilus, Aivas Ragauskas.[7]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Historical_Society
Manor houses of Polish-Lithuanian nobility,"A manor house of Polish-Lithuanian nobility is called dwór[1] or dworek in Polish and dvaras in Lithuanian.

The architectural form of the manor house evolved around the late Polish Renaissance period and continued until the Second World War, which, together with the  communist takeover of Poland and Soviet occupation of Lithuania, spelled the end of the nobility in both nations. A 1944 decree nationalized most mansions as property of the nobility; few were adapted to other purposes and many slowly fell into ruin. A vast majority of such mansions remain unused and are slowly deteriorating.

Noble manors in Poland were typically small to medium-sized residencies for the landed gentry.[2] According to estimates, in the 16th century, Greater Poland alone had several hundred to a thousand middle szlachta manors, while the entire Crown of the Kingdom of Poland had at least a dozen thousand.[3]

During the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Polish-Lithuanian nobility built manor houses in the countryside. This was a preferred location for one's residence, as the nobility, following the sarmatism ideology, felt contempt for the cities, even though members of this elite also had residences in a major city or town (but these were large lateral apartments rather than townhouses).

The vast majority of such countryside manors in the beginning were made of wood.[4][5] They tended to fall into two types: rare palaces of the magnates, and smaller, one-story houses, in which wood was the most common building material.[5] Starting with the Renaissance period, mansions built with masonwork appeared, often designed to enhance their defensive characteristics.[4][6] Although early on, such mansions were often designed as defensive mini-fortresses, over time - around the baroque period - the defensive function began to disappear.[4][6]

The smallest ones had 2-4 rooms. Larger ones would have many more, including guest rooms and a chapel. Magnates' palaces would even boast their own opera house.[5] Common furniture included benches, cupboards, tables, beds and small chairs, commonly made from tilia wood.[5] Rarer furniture would include chests and wardrobes. Furniture was often painted (green being the most common color),[5] sometimes engraved and inlaid. Walls were often painted with floral or moral and historical motifs, and decorated with Oriental (Persian, Turkish) or West European (Belgian, Flemish, French) tapestries and rugs, coats of arms, portraits, mirrors, weapons and trophies.[4][5] Floors were wooden. Ceilings were carved and decorated with various hanging decorations (including candelabras).[5] Windows in the richest mansions would be fitted with Venetian glass, and the rest would use green glass or waxed canvas.[5] Stoves were common. Depending on a family's wealth, they would be made of materials from rough earthenware to porcelain and alabaster.[5]

Early renaissance mansions were based on a rectangular design, with corner chambers (alkierze) and a porch.[7] The roof was a Polish variant of the hip roof (termed the ""broken Polish roof"" [pl]) covered with shakes.[6] In the baroque period, alkierze were replaced by risalits, and mansard roofs appeared.[4][6] The Classicism period saw porches replaced by porticos with tympanums.[6][7]

Over time, Polish manors adopted a palace-villa form with Baroque and Palladian style elements.[2] As Polish architectural writing developed, their design became more standardized.[8] The first Polish architectural treatise, from around the mid-17 century, included instructions for building early modern manors.[9][a]

Manors were constructed across Poland not only in rural areas but also in cities, particularly in Warsaw, where they remained the most popular type of residence from the 17-18th centuries until the 1830s.[11]

Since the 19th century, richer residences (palaces) were termed manors (Polish: dwór), while the more modest homes of provincial nobility were called little manors (Polish: dworek).[12]

Many Polish and Lithuanian noble families lost their ancestral manor houses and lands after the failed uprisings against Russian Empire, as Tsarist authorities confiscated manors owned by families who supported the uprisings.[13]

In Lithuania, after the abolition of serfdom in 1861, many manor estates lost ownership of the nearby towns and villages, as peasants were no longer the property of the manor's lord. During the Lithuanian Land Reforms of 1922, almost every manor's land size was greatly reduced and the land was redistributed to landless peasants. After Lithuania was occupied by Soviets in 1944, all manors were nationalized.[13]

In Poland, the ideologically driven nationalization policies and architectural preservation guidelines enacted during the early years of the Polish People's Republic contributed to the destruction of many manors houses.[14] Before WW2, there were tens of thousands of manors. Today, only over 2,000 remain, often in very poor condition.[15]

Manor architecture influenced church buildings and, by the mid-19th century, impacted peasant and small-town architecture as well. Inns and smithies were built in a similar style.[2] In the 17th and 18th centuries, a view emerged that identified the manor architecture with 'Polishness', treating it as 'native' and 'unique'.[16] It gained particular traction in the 19th century during the period of Romanticism,[17] leading to the creation of the dworek style (Polish: styl narodowy or styl dworkowy) — an urban or suburban villa from the first half of the 20th century, in which public utility buildings, such as railway stations, were also designed in Poland.[18] The dworek style design was popular in the Second Polish Republic, and is still inspiring some modern Polish manors.[4][6]

Sigismund I the Old,"Sigismund I the Old (Polish: Zygmunt I Stary, Lithuanian: Žygimantas I Senasis; 1 January 1467 – 1 April 1548) was King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1506 until his death in 1548. Sigismund I was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the son of Casimir IV and younger brother of Kings John I Albert and Alexander I Jagiellon. He was nicknamed ""the Old"" in later historiography to distinguish him from his son and successor, Sigismund II Augustus. Before ascending to the Polish and Lithuanian thrones, he was Duke of Głogów from 1499, Duke of Opava from 1501, and governor of Silesia from 1504 on behalf of his brother, King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary.

Sigismund was born in the town of Kozienice in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife Elizabeth of Austria. He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father. Sigismund's eldest brother and rightful heir Vladislaus II instead became the King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia as the successor to George of Poděbrady in Bohemia and then to Matthias Corvinus in Hungary, thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms. When Casimir died, the Polish-Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons, with John Albert being crowned King of Poland, and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert's sudden death in 1501. Hence, Sigismund's reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39.

A capable monarch and a patron of arts, Sigismund established Polish rule over Ducal Prussia and annexed the Duchy of Mazovia with Warsaw, while retaining the nation's wealth and prominence in the region. He made sure that his nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, and Albert's Protestant successors would pay feudal homage or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence. This was observed until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1657 when Prussia gained its sovereignty. Sigismund and his commander Jan Amor Tarnowski also defeated Moldavia at Obertyn in 1531, and Muscovy in 1535, thereby strengthening the country's eastern borders. His 42-year reign was further marked by decisive contributions to Polish architecture, cuisine, language, and customs, especially at the behest of his second wife, the Italian-born Bona Sforza. Italian styles and fashions dominated at the height of the Polish Renaissance and Polish Golden Age, which developed the Catholic identity of Poland. He was commemorated on a contemporary 200-złoty banknote.

Sigismund was married twice, first to noblewoman Barbara Zápolya from Hungary and then to Bona Sforza, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan.[1] Their only surviving son and the last Jagiellon king, Sigismund Augustus, was made his co-kingvivente rege in 1529 and formally assumed throne when Sigismund the Old died in 1548.[2]

Sigismund was the son of King Casimir IV Jagiellon and Elisabeth Habsburg of Austria.[1] He followed his brothers John Albert and Alexander to the Polish throne.[3] Their eldest brother Vladislaus became king of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia. Sigismund was christened as the namesake of his maternal great-grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund.

When Casimir died in 1492, Sigismund was his only son without any titles or land. From 1495 to 1496, he petitioned his brother Alexander to provide him with land, and Elisabeth of Austria attempted to install him on the Austrian throne. Both efforts failed. In 1497, King John I Albert, his older brother, led an invasion of Moldavia that was intended to place Sigismund on its throne. This, too, was a disastrous failure. Finally, his eldest brother Vladislaus II, King of Bohemia and Hungary, granted him the duchies of Głogów (1499) and Opava (1501), and in 1504 Sigismund became governor of Silesia and Lower Lusatia.[4]

John I Albert died suddenly in 1501, and was succeeded by Alexander I, who died in 1506. After his death, Sigismund arrived in Vilnius, where he was elected by the Lithuanian Ducal Council on 13 September 1506 as Grand Duke of Lithuania, contrary to the Union of Mielnik (1501), which proposed a joint Polish-Lithuanian election of a monarch. On 8 December 1506, during the session of the Polish Senate in Piotrków, Sigismund was elected King of Poland. He arrived in Kraków on 20 January 1507 and was crowned four days later in Wawel Cathedral by Primate Andrzej Boryszewski.[5][6]

The internal situation in Poland was characterised by broad authorisation of the Chamber of Deputies, confirmed and extended in the constitution of Nihil novi. During Alexander's reign, the law of Nihil novi had been instituted, which forbade kings of Poland from enacting laws without the consent of the Sejm. Sigismund had little control over the act, unlike the senators, whom he personally appointed. Eventually, during his reign, Sigismund benefited from the advice of the local nobility, competent ministers in charge of the royal judiciary system, and the wealthy influential treasurers of Kraków. Although he was reluctant to the parliamentary system and political independence of the nobility, he recognised the authority of legal norms, supported legalism and summoned annual sessions of the Sejm, usually obtaining funds on state defence. However he was unsuccessful at attempting to create a permanent fund for defence from the annual income tax. Despite this, in 1527 he established a conscript army and the bureaucracy needed to finance it. He set up the legal codes that formalised serfdom in Poland, placing the peasants into the private estates of nobles.[7]

Likely related to tax matters was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the king, made on 5 May 1523. The identity of the would-be assassin - who shot the ruler while he was strolling in the evening around the cloisters of the Wawel castle - and his potential supporters was never established. Unclear motives remained after the assassination attempt. Three weeks before the event, Sigismund I introduced a new edict that was very unfavourable and somewhat hostile to the high-ranking nobles and their interests.

Sigismund I achieved several economic successes, including partial debt reduction, separation of accounts of public taxation from the royal treasury, strengthening of the activities of the mint operating in Kraków, and the attempt to organise the processing of income from operating salt mines.[8] Furthermore, he issued a statute for the Armenians (1519) and strongly intended to harmonise the judicial system across the country.[9]

Between 1530 and 1538 the king issued two statutes defining the rules for the selection of the monarch, which permanently established the election viritim. The laws held that all social groups, regardless of their wealth, could watch the election process (unusquisque qui vellet), and the election was to be free (electio Regis libera).

Sigismund successfully organised the agricultural economy, looked after the development of the royal cities and recovered numerous goods of the treasury belonging to the crown that were under lien. During the financial activities, the King received full support of his wife, Queen Bona, who aimed to expand the royal estates by purchasing and improving economic efficiency. In 1514 he set up the Council of Four Lands and put Abraham of Bohemia in charge of it.[10]

At the start of his reign, King Sigismund I the Old inherited a Kingdom of Poland with a century-long tradition of liberties of the nobility, confirmed in numerous privileges. A rebellion in Lwów widely known as the Chicken War (Polish: Wojna kokosza) was an anti-royalist and anti-absolutist rokosz (revolt) by the Polish nobility that occurred in 1537. The derisive name was coined by the magnates, who for the most part supported the King and claimed that the ""war's"" only effect was the near-extinction of the local chickens, eaten by the nobles gathered for the rebellion at Lwów in eastern part of Lesser Poland.[11]

To strengthen his power, Sigismund initiated a set of reforms, establishing a permanent conscription army in 1527 and extending the bureaucratic apparatus necessary to govern the state and finance the army. Supported by his Italian consort Bona Sforza, he began buying up land and issue agriculture reformas to enlarge the royal treasury. He initiated a process of restitution of royal properties, previously pawned or rented to the nobles.

The nobility gathered near the city to meet to a levée en masse and called for a military campaign against Moldavia. However, the lesser and middle strata of the nobility organised a revolt to force the King to abandon his risky reforms. The nobles presented him with 36 demands, most notably a cessation of further land acquisitions by Queen Bona, exemption of the nobility from the tithe, confirmation and extension of privileges for nobles and adoption of a law concerning Incompatibilitas — an individual wouldn't be able to hold two or more official administrative positions in the country. The role of the Incompatibilitas was to prevent wealthy magnates from usurping too much power at the expense of lesser nobles.

However, the revolt soon transpired that the nobility's leaders were divided and that achieving a settlement was almost impossible. Too weak to start a civil war against the King, the protesters finally agreed to what was thought a compromise. Sigismund rejected most of their demands, while accepting the principle of Incompatibilitas the following year and agreeing not to force the election of the future king in vivente rege. Thereupon, the nobility returned to their homes having achieved little.

Sigismund was intermittently at war with Vasili III of Muscovy beginning in 1507, before the Polish army was fully under his command. Further tensions escalated when Vasili also discovered that Sigismund was bribing Khan Meñli I Giray to attack the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[12] In December 1512, Muscovite forces marched into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seeking to capture Smolensk, a major trading center between Russia and Europe.[13] The initial six- and four-week sieges in 1513 were a failure,[14] but the city fell to the Muscovites in July 1514.[12]

Russia subsequently suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the field. In 1512, Grand Hetman of Lithuania, Konstanty Ostrogski, ransacked the region of Severia and vanquished a Russian force of approximately 6,000 men. On 8 September 1514, Muscovy suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Orsha, which prevented the Russians to place all the former Kievan Rus' lands under their lordship.[15] Poland exploited the battle for propaganda purposes with strong anti-Russian sentiment. A letter sent to Rome stated that ""Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom"".[16]
Regardless of victory, the Polish–Lithuanian troops were incapable of moving quickly enough to retake Smolensk.[17] In 1518, Russian forces were again beaten during the siege of Polotsk,[18] when according to legend the Lithuanian forces were inspired by the sight of their patron saint, Saint Casimir, the older brother of Sigismund. However, this was dubbed by historians as a folk tale. In 1522, a truce was signed between Lithuania and Muscovy which extended until 1534.

In 1534, when Grand Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł and the Tatars pillaged western Russia, the Muscovites in retaliation invaded Lithuania once more. They were eventually stopped by Polish commander Jan Amor Tarnowski and allies at Starodub in 1535.[19] Their defeat strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union's eastern flank until the beginning of the Livonian War in 1558.[19]

In 1515 Sigismund entered into an alliance with the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. In return for Maximilian lending weight to the provisions of the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), Sigismund consented to the marriage of the children of Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary, his brother, to the grandchildren of Maximilian. Through this double marriage contract, Bohemia and Hungary passed to the House of Habsburg in 1526, on the death of Sigismund's nephew, Louis II, who led his forces against Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire in the disastrous Battle of Mohács.

Worried about the growing ties between the Habsburgs and Russia, in 1524 Sigismund signed a Franco-Polish alliance with King Francis I of France to avoid a possible war on two fronts.[20] Francis I himself was looking for allies in Central Europe to curtail the increasing power of Habsburg Emperor Charles V, whose realms were labelled ""the empire on which the sun never sets"".[21] Furthermore, Queen Bona was instrumental in establishing an alliance between Poland and France, with the objective of recovering Milan.[20] The official negotiations were conducted by Antonio Rincon in 1524, who was then followed by Jerome Laski.[21] Through the agreement, the son of Francis, Henry, Duke of Orléans, was to marry one of Sigismund's daughters, and Sigismund's eldest son was to marry a daughter of Francis I.[21]

The negotiations came to an end and the alliance was disbanded when Francis' troops were defeated by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525.[21] Disturbed by the failure of his campaign, Francis turned to Hungary instead and formed a Franco-Hungarian alliance with King John Zápolya in 1528.[21]

After the death of Janusz III of Masovia in 1526, Sigismund succeeded in uniting the Duchy of Masovia and Warsaw with the Kingdom of Poland. There was speculation whether Janusz and his younger brother Stanisław were poisoned by a subject of Queen Bona.[22][23] The accusations were so pervasive and rampant that Sigismund ordered an investigation, as a result of which a special edict was declared on 9 February 1528 confirming that the Masovian princes died naturally or due to related illness. According to chronicler Jan Długosz, the real cause of the death of both princes could have been inherited tuberculosis.[24]

In other matters of policy, Sigismund sought peaceful coexistence with the Khanate of Crimea, but was unable to completely end border skirmishes.[25]

Over two centuries of wars against the Teutonic Knights ended in 1525 with the Treaty of Kraków after the final Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521).[26] Previously, the Second Peace of Thorn (1466) placed the Teutonic Order under Polish suzerainty and interfered with German interests in Livonia, Pomerania, Warmia and Masuria. The Order attempted to avoid paying tribute to Polish monarchs which was a demonstration of weakness and dependence.

In accordance with the new Treaty of Kraków, the Order was abruptly secularized and turned de facto into a puppet state of Poland which lasted until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1655. Sigismund's nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, converted to Lutheranism under the persuasion of Martin Luther, and paid a feudal homage to Sigismund.[27] In return he was granted the domains of the Order as the First Duke of Prussia. This became known in Polish and Lithuanian history as the ""Prussian Homage"", which was often featured in arts. The Prussian Landtag and parliament assembled in Königsberg, where envoys embraced both the new Duke and the Protestant Reformation. Thereupon, the Teutonic Order lost its importance as a military order in Prussia and retreated to the Holy Roman Empire where it became secluded.[26]

Sigismund had a profound interest in Renaissance humanism and the revival of classical antiquity. His second consort Bona Sforza, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, was also instrumental in developing the Polish Renaissance and brought renowned Italian artists, architects and sculptors from her native country. It was under Sigismund's reign that Renaissance began to flourish in Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Sigismund II Augustus later continued his father's legacy.

Among the illustrious figures that guested or lived in Poland at the time were Bartholommeo Berecci, Francesco Fiorentino, Santi and Mateo Gucci, Bernardo Morando, Giovanni Battista di Quadro and Hans Dürer. Most of the decorators working for the court were foreigners, especially Italians and Germans who had a profound impact on Poland's architecture as a whole.[28] The centrepiece of their work is Wawel Castle in Kraków, the seat of Polish monarchs as well as one of the largest castles in Central Europe. Situated on a hill overlooking Old Town, the fortified residence was extensively reconstructed in the Renaissance style and to the personal needs of the royal family. The Italian cloistered courtyard in the shape of a quadrangle, corridors, archways and portals were designed by Fiorentino with the help of Benedykt from Sandomierz. A similar design was undertaken in Niepołomice Castle, the hunting retreat of the Jagiellons.[29]

The most prominent example of Sigismund's architectural legacy is a funerary monument in the form of a chapel at Wawel Cathedral. It was constructed between 1519 and 1533 according to plans by Bartolomeo Berrecci of Florence, and serves as a mausoleum of the last Jagiellons.[30] The exterior dome is gold-plated and interior tombs made of marble were designed by Santi Gucci.[30] Historians, experts and architects unanimously voted the chapel as ""the most beautiful example of the Tuscan Renaissance north of the Alps"".[31][32] The monarch also commissioned a 12.6-tonne bell which was named in his honour. The Royal Sigismund Bell was installed 13 July 1521 on Wawel Cathedral's northernmost tower. Apart from religious and national holidays, the bell rung on some of the most significant moments in Polish history and is one of Poland's national symbols.[33]

Sigismund suffered from numerous illnesses and diseases, especially towards the end of his life. Most notably, he was tormented by constant fevers since youth as well as gout and acute rheumatism in the autumn of 1528.[34][35] The condition, which severely affected his joints and right leg, was repetitive and continued in 1529 and 1534. It is likely that Sigismund Augustus was co-crowned vivente rege in 1529 as a result of these pervasive pains and in case his father died unexpectedly.[36] Furthermore, bad eating habits and a poor diet contributed to the king's ailing health, in particular large amounts of beer and mead.[34] Eventually, the king's inability to walk forced him to be carried in a litter. However, despite his age, Sigismund was of sound mind throughout and remained active in politics until death.[35] In 1543, he recovered from an influenza which spread in Kraków and in 1545 he enjoyed a last hunting excursion to Niepołomice.[36]

Sigismund died on 1 April 1548, Easter day at the age of 81 and was buried on 7 July at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, Sigismund II Augustus, who became the last Jagiellon king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1587 Sigismund the Old's grandson, Sigismund III from the House of Vasa, was elected King of Poland. He was the son of Catherine Jagiellon and her husband John III Vasa of Sweden. Hence, Sigismund III could not belong to the Jagiellonian dynasty by his mother, but the Jagiellon bloodline of Polish monarchs continued until the death of Sigismund Vasa's second son John II Casimir.

In 1512, Sigismund married Barbara Zápolya (d. 1515),[1] a Hungarian noblewoman, with whom he had two daughters:

In 1517, Sigismund married Bona Sforza,[38] with whom he had two sons and four daughters:

By his mistress, Katarzyna Telniczanka (d. 1528),[39] he also fathered three children prior to his first marriage:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigismund_I_the_Old
Lithuanian Navy,"The Lithuanian Navy (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Karinės jūrų pajėgos; formally: Lithuanian Naval Forces) is the naval arm of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Though formally established on 1 August 1935 its roots stretch back as far as naval engagements on the Baltic Sea in the Medieval period. Lithuanian naval units saw some service with Soviet naval forces during World War II, and the Naval Forces has been re-established in its own right and continues to expand since Lithuania's independence in 1990.

Although the origin of the Lithuanian Navy dates back to the period between World War I and World War II, the history of the involvement in naval battles existed earlier. The Baltic tribe of Aistians that settled down in the Baltic Sea shore built ships and used them for trade as well as for military purposes. Furthermore, according to annals, in the 13th century other Baltic tribes, the Coronians and Samogitians, tried to destroy the castle of Riga coming by ships. It is also known about the victory of Lithuanians in the ship battle in Nemunas River at the time when Duke Vytenis ruled the Duchy of Lithuania. The most known and important naval victory was achieved by great hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz on 24 March 1609 near Salismünde (now Salacgrīva in Latvia) where he defeated a Swedish fleet burning two enemy ships and losing none and hence breaking the blockade of Riga city. But generally the loss of territories near the Baltic Sea had a negative impact on Lithuania's maritime development.[citation needed]

The Commonwealth Navy was small and played a relatively minor role in the history of the Commonwealth.[1] Despite having access to the Baltic Sea, neither Poland nor Lithuania had any significant navy throughout their histories.

At the turn of the seventeenth century, Poland became ruled by the House of Vasa, and was involved in a series of wars with Sweden (see also dominium maris baltici).[1] Vasa kings attempted to create a proper fleet, but their attempts met with repeated failures, due to lack of funds in the royal treasury (Polish nobility saw little need for the fleet and refused to raise taxes for its construction, and Gdańsk continued its opposition to the idea of a royal fleet).[1] During the reign of Sigismund III, the most celebrated victory of the Commonwealth Navy under command of Admiral Arend Dickmann took place at the Battle of Oliwa in 1627 against Sweden, during the Polish-Swedish War. The victory over Sweden secured for Poland permanent access to the Atlantic, and laid the foundations for expeditions beyond Europe. The plans for the independent fleet fell through shortly afterwards due to a badly executed alliance with the Habsburgs who in 1629 took over the fleet.[1]

The Commission of Royal Ships (Komisja Okrętów Królewskich) was created in 1625. This commission, along with the ultimate allocation of funds by the Sejm in 1637, attempted to create a permanent Commonwealth Navy. Władysław IV Waza who took the throne in 1632 bought 12 ships, and built a dedicated port for the royal navy (Władysławowo).[1]

The 58th article signed and sworn by king Władysław IV Pacta conventa announced creation of a war fleet ""according to needs of Commonwealth"". Władysław, taking the throne after his father Sigismund III Vasa died in 1632, was in favour of expanding and modernising the Commonwealth military. One of his plans was the expansion of the Commonwealth Navy.

Despite his attempts he did not recover ships taken by Swedes in Wismar and Travemuende. Władysław decided to build a new fleet and created a ""Naval Commission"" with Gerard Denhoff as a chairman to fulfill this task. The choice of other members of this Commission was not random, it contained wealthy king supporters, like the merchant and owner of a merchant fleet from Danzig, Georg Hewel (Gdańsk, Jerzy Hewel). Because the Sejm (Polish Diet) was at best reluctant to pay for new ships and royal chest was permanently empty it was due to Hewel that the new fleet was created at all. He gave to the king's disposal 10 ships, a few of them were carrying small caliber cannons. These ships had to be modernized in order to allow them to carry heavier cannons. Additionally the king wanted to build a few galleons in Danzig and Puck and because of long construction times, also to purchase a few ships abroad, but those plans were not realized (except of purchase of one Danish ship - requiring quite serious repair).

Thus the new 'Polish fleet' consisted of 10 ex-merchant ships: ""Czarny Orzeł"" (Black Eagle – 420 tons, 32 cannons), ""Prorok Samuel"" (Prophet Samuel – 400 tons, 24 cannons), ""Wielkie Słońce"" (Great Sun – 540 tons, 24 cannons), ""Nowy Czarny Orzeł"" (New Black Eagle – 24 cannons). Four smaller ships ""Biały Orzeł"" (White Eagle), ""Charitas"", ""Gwiazda"" (Star) and ""Strzelec"" (Saggitarius) had 200 tons and two the smallest ""Święty Piotr"" (Saint Peter) or ""Fortuna"" (Fortune) 160 tons and ""Mały Biały Orzeł"" (Small White Eagle) 140 tons and 4 small caliber cannons and additionally one small galley. Command of the newly created fleet was given to rear admiral Aleksander Seton.

The King did not forget to ensure a safe base for the newly created fleet. The Harbor in Puck was too shallow for the biggest ships and the usage of Wisłoujście (a fortress near Gdansk) was constantly plagued by difficulties from the Danzig Patricians (afraid that a king with a strong naval arm would step upon their ""liberties"", control tolls, exert taxes etc.). The royal engineers Friederich Getkant (Fryderyk Getkant), Jan Pleitner and Eliasz Arciszewski selected a location for two new fortifications with naval bases on the Hel peninsula. They were quite impressive and raised in record time (finished in 1634, consisting of strong wooden (oak) palisades, earthen walls, trenches and moats). These fortifications were named after the King and his brother: Władysławowo and Kazimierzowo (the small town of Władysławowo still exists on the Hel peninsula nowadays - the fort was more or less on its current edge).

Additionally about 500 Cossacks under Konstanty Kołek with their small boats (Chaika) were brought. It is uncertain if they were used at all.[3] Their main goal was to plague Swedish communication and supply lines near Piława and on Zatoka Wiślana (Vistula Bay). There were plans to use Cossacks in their light but very fast boats against Inflanty (Livonia) and even to raid the Swedish shore (to burn, pillage, capture merchant ships etc.). Cossacks were known from their plundering raids on Black Sea (they even burned suburbs of Istanbul once or twice). Because of the overall tonnage and armament difference between Polish and Swedish naval fleets even before (in 1620s), the main role of the Polish fleet was to disrupt Swedish communication and supply lines, to capture merchant ships bringing supplies for the Swedes (even if they belonged to neutral powers, for example ships belonging to the Netherlands, England or German duchies/cities were captured and sequestrated).

The king's plan never had strong support from Polish nobles (szlachta): high costs and reluctance to strengthen the king's power were always crippling Władysław's plans. Thus not even all the king's expenses for the modernization of those ten ships were fully repaid. Unfortunate international alliances (with Denmark and Muscovy) did not allow him to mount any offensive actions and the majority of the wars he participated in were defensive ones (like the Smolensk War with Muscovy in 1634). A new armistice with Sweden signed in Stumsdorf (Sztumska Wies) knocked the last argument out of the king's hand. After that the king wanted to use his ships to organize the first Polish merchant company (with help of Hewel), however Hewel's death stopped even those plans. Finally the ships were sold. The built fortifications were salt in Denmark's and the Danzig Patriciate eyes and under their pressure were destroyed in 1640s.

The Swedes were without king after the death of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and lost battles in Germany. The Polish nobles did not want to fight a new war so when the Swedes returned most of the lands they captured in the previous war, a new armistice for 35 years was signed. The cost of the Polish preparations for this war was comparable with the costs of the king's relief of Smolensk in 1634 and his campaign against Muscovy.

The fleet was destroyed in 1637 by Denmark, without declaration of war.[4] The remaining ships were sold in the years 1641-1643, which marked the end of the Commonwealth Navy.[1]

The ships of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth navy included:[citation needed]

After World War I, the Government of Lithuania attempted to establish a maritime defense force. However, due to various political and economical reasons, the maritime defense force was only partially implemented. In 1923, Lithuania gained the control of Klaipėda harbor[5] and gradual development of the maritime defense force started. The purchase of a minesweeper in 1927 was one of the first significant steps to implement Lithuanian Government aims. The ship was commissioned as the training ship Prezidentas Smetona (President Smetona). Captain Antanas Kaskelis was assigned as ship's commanding officer. Several small boats carried out patrol duties (Coast Guard 3-6 cutter) and one small yacht in Klaipėda harbor. Naval officers were educated abroad. On 1 August 1935, the commander in chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, General Stasys Rastikis, officially established the Lithuanian Navy as a branch of the Lithuanian Armed Forces.

Before the beginning of World War II on 22 March 1939 the region of Klaipėda was occupied by Germany.[6] Once the war started Lithuanian naval ships were forced to leave Klaipėda for Liepāja harbor in Latvia. During the Soviet occupation, 3 Russian boats blocked ship Prezidentas Smetona in Sventoji harbor (1940). The Lithuanian Navy was attached to the Soviet Union's Baltic maritime defense force. Prezidentas Smetona was renamed Korall and participated in the sea battles against Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. On 11 January 1945, the ship triggered a mine and sank in the Gulf of Finland.

After the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, Lithuania began organization of its Armed Forces. On 4 July 1992 the Lithuanian Navy were re-established and Juozapas Algis Leisis was appointed as a commander of the Coast Guard Squadron. The first commissioned ship in the Lithuanian Navy was the A41 Vėtra, which at that point belonged to the Klaipėda harbour administration. Vėtra was used for SAR and supply operations. In 1992, the Lithuanian Navy received two Grisha-class corvette, Zemaitis (F11) and Aukstaitis (F12) from Russia. After the crew training period in June 1992, both corvettes participated in the international military exercise US BALTOPS 93. This marked the beginning of Lithuania's international cooperation with other navies.

In the period spanning 1992–2000 the Lithuanian Navy received three Storm-class patrol boats from Norway, two Lindau-class minehunter from Germany, a cutter (ex-Vilnele 1983) from the Klaipėda harbor administration, and a tug and dive cutter Lokys from Sweden. Another milestone in Lithuanian naval history was the establishment of the Sea Coastal Surveillance Company in 1993 which was then transformed into the Sea Coastal Surveillance Service.

In 2004, Lithuania became an official member of the NATO alliance. In 2006, the Naval Forces acquired the ex-HNoMS Vidar (N52) from the Royal Norwegian Navy. The ship was designated as Jotvingis (N42) and has been serving as a command-and-supply ship. In the period spanning 2008–2016 the Naval Forces bought four Flyvefisken-class patrol vessels from Denmark which received the names P11 Žemaitis, P12 Dzūkas, P14 Aukštaitis and P15 Sėlis. The Naval Forces also received SAR ship Šakiai which was transferred from the Klaipėda harbour administration. In 2013, ex-HMS Cottesmore and ex-HMS Dulverton were acquired, modernized and commissioned as M53 Skalvis and M54 Kuršis. Both are used in the Mine Countermeasures Squadron.

In May 2020, it was announced that the procurement of a third Hunt-class minehunter for the Lithuanian Navy was approved by the UK defense ministry.[7] In April 2022, it was announced that the Navy will acquire Jehu-class patrol boats from Finland.[8]

From 1994 to 1999, the 7th Dragoons Coastal Defense Battalion performed marine infantry tasks. It belonged to the Naval Forces, participated in international operations and exercises, and was later integrated into the Land Forces.

From 1 August 2022, in order to eliminate the coastal and port defense gap and perform other functions assigned to the marines, the Naval Forces Port and Coastal Defense Service was established and partially formed by merging the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Divers Team and the Naval Forces Logistics Service Security Company into one structure, which includes two infantry (fusilier) companies. In the process of forming the unit's traditions, the soldiers serving in the unit began to be called marine fusiliers (marine infantry), and the service itself is unofficially called the Fusilier Battalion.[9]

In April 2025, the Navy announced that the marine unit would be officially renamed the General Kazimieras Nestoras Sapiega Fusiliers Battalion and would continue the traditions of the 7th Fusiliers Regiment.[10]

Former ships included: Grisha III-class corvettes (F11 Žemaitis, F12 Aukštaitis), Lindau-class minehunters (M51 Kuršis, M52 Sūduvis), Storm-class patrol boats (P31 Dzūkas, P32 Selis, P33 Skalvis) and some support ships and cutters (A41 Vėtra, H23 Lokys).[14][15][16][17][18]

Belarusian history in the Russian Empire,"The Belarusian history within the Russian Empire is associated with the history of Belarus from the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to the October Revolution when the present-day Belarus' lands were made part of the Russian Empire.

The First Partition of Poland (1772) awarded only some parts of the Belarusian lands, 
northern part of the Polotsk Voivodeship, entire Mstsislaw Voivodeship and Vitebsk Voivodeship, and southeastern part of the Minsk Voivodeship, which became parts of the Pskov and the Mogilev guberniyas (governorates).

In 1776, the Polotsk Governorate was created after separating from the original Russian lands of the Pskov Governorate.[1]

The second partition (1793) added more (the remaining part of Minsk Voivodeship,  Bracław Voivodeship and Vilnius Voivodeship and Brest Litovsk Voivodeship). After the third partition virtually all Belarusian lands were within the Russian Empire, and the Belarusian guberniyas eventually constituted part of the Northwestern Krai.[2]

Initially, most of the Polish feudal system was retained in Belarusian lands, the polonized Litvin Catholic Szlachta dominated the territories, whilst most of the Ruthenian population was peasantry. Unlike the strong nationalist drive seen in Right-bank Ukraine, a legacy of the Cossacks following the partitions, most of the Belarusian lands remained inert in terms of changes.

Polish nationalism sparked the rise of Belarusian self-identity. In 1830, the szlachta, began the November Uprising and after its failure, Nicholas I began a systematic policy of cracking down on Polish influence in the lands of modern Belarus that were claimed by Russian tsars as White Russia. First the ruling class was removed, and the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church, at the Synod of Polotsk reverted to Eastern Orthodoxy under the leadership of Joseph Semashko in 1839.[3]

Meanwhile, since the mid-1830s, ethnographic works about Belarus began to appear, the tentative attempts to study the language were taken up (e.g., Belarusian grammar by Shpilevskiy). The Belarusian literary tradition began to re-form, basing on the folk language instead of the written Ruthenian, initiated by the works of Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, Jan Czeczot, Jan Barszczewski and others.[4] Still, a large part of the literature had to hide itself behind the labels of ""Polish"" or sometimes even ""Bulgarian"", because Russian censorship did not tolerate the Belarusian national movement up until the Revolution of 1905.

In the beginning of the 1860s, both pro-Russian and pro-Polish parties in the Belarusian lands had begun to realise that the decisive role in the upcoming conflicts was shifting to the peasantry. So, a large amount of propaganda appeared, targeted at the peasantry and published in the Belarusian language.[5] Notable example was the anti-Russian, anti-Tsarist newspaper Mużyckaja prauda (Peasants' Truth) (1862–1863) by Konstanty Kalinowski.[6]

The 1860s marked a turning point of Belarus in the Russian Empire. The emancipation of the serfs in 1861, followed by the January Uprising fully left the Polish influence on Belarus behind.  A number of authors started publishing in the Belarusian language, including Jan Czeczot, Władysław Syrokomla and Konstanty Kalinowski. What followed was the Industrial Revolution under Alexander III and with it the arrival of the railways [7] Peasants sought a better lot in growing industrial centres in Belarus and a further 1.5 million people leaving to other parts of the Empire in the half-century preceding the Russian Revolution of 1917.

During this time the Russification of Belarusian culture brought to the results that in the 1897 Russian Empire Census, about 5.89 million people declared themselves speakers of Belarusian language rather than Litvin or Ruthenian, as they did under Polish rule. The Belarusian nobility and middle class had a firm footing in the regions and Stolypin's reforms allowed the peasants standard of living to greatly increase. However at the same time, many rising Belarusian nationalists, were fearing that the growth of the Russian influence on their culture, and as a result played a decisive role in the 1905 Revolution afterwards Nicholas II officially recognised Belarusian language as independent and allowed its teachings.

During World War I Belarus was caught in the front lines. The Russian Revolution of 1917 and dissolution of the Russian Empire as well as loyalty of the Germans enabled Belarusians, to establish in 1918 an independent state, the Belarusian People's Republic. However, by 1919 Bolsheviks took control over Belarus and forced the country's democratic government into exile.

Today the period of Belarus in Russian Empire is viewed with some controversy. On one side, many recognise that the period enabled the Litvin and Ruthenian identity to transform into a modern Belarusian nationality. On the other, in doing so, many traits, though coming via Poland of the Belarusian culture were lost under Tsarist pressure.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusian_history_in_the_Russian_Empire

From the 14th century, this was an honorary court title and a district office in Crown of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podstoli
Union of Krewo,"In a strict sense, the Union of Krewo or Act of Krėva (also spelled Union of Krevo, Act of Kreva; Polish: unia w Krewie; Lithuanian: Krėvos sutartis) comprised a set of prenuptial promises made at Kreva Castle on 14 August 1385 by Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania, in regard to  his prospective marriage to the underage reigning Queen Jadwiga of Poland.

Though very limited in scope, the ""Union of Krewo"", in historiography, often refers not only to the particular document but to  events of 1385–1386 as a whole.[1] After the 1385 negotiations, Jogaila converted to Christianity, married Jadwiga, and was crowned King of Poland in 1386.

The union proved a decisive moment in the  histories of Poland and Lithuania; it marked the beginning of four centuries of shared history of the two polities. By 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian union had developed into a new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which lasted until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.

Louis I of Hungary died on 10 September 1382. Since he had only two surviving daughters, Mary (born ca. 1371) and Jadwiga (born ca. 1373), Poland faced a succession crisis. Candidates for the throne included Mary's fiancé Sigismund of Luxembourg, Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, and Vladislaus II of Opole. Mary and her fiancé were rejected by the Polish nobles, who did not wish to continue a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary.[2] Polish nobles competed with each other and a brief civil war broke out in Greater Poland. Eventually, after long negotiations with Jadwiga's mother Elizabeth of Bosnia, who was regent of Hungary, Jadwiga arrived in Kraków and was crowned as King of Poland (not as Queen of Poland, to emphasize her rights to the throne) on 15 October 1384. The new monarch still needed a suitable husband. She was betrothed to William of Austria, who in summer 1385 traveled to Poland in an attempt to consummate the proposed marriage and present a fait accompli. He succeeded in reaching Wawel, but was forcibly removed by Polish nobles. It is unclear whether he succeeded in consummating the marriage, but biased Austrian sources continued to accuse Jadwiga of bigamy.[3] Nobles from Lesser Poland, including Spytek of Melsztyn, Jan of Tarnów, and Jan Tęczyński, proposed that Jadwiga marry Jogaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania.

Grand Duke Algirdas died in 1377 and left the throne to his son Jogaila. He inherited a large state, inhabited by pagan Lithuanians and Orthodox Ruthenians. For the last century, Lithuanians defended themselves from the Teutonic Knights, a crusading military order dedicated to conversion of the Grand Duchy into Catholicism. Jogaila understood that the conversion was inevitable and searched for the best opportunities. The Treaty of Dubysa of 1382 with the Knights included provisions of Jogaila's conversion within four years.[4] However, the treaty was never ratified. Accepting Christianity from a long-standing enemy was dangerous, unpopular, and could push Lithuania into dependence of the Knights. In 1384, Jogaila explored another option, presented by the Grand Duchy of Moscow and brokered by his Orthodox mother Uliana of Tver: converting to Orthodoxy and marrying Sophia, daughter of Dmitry Donskoy.[5] However, in the eyes of Catholics, Orthodoxy was not any better than paganism. Therefore, such conversion would not protect from the Teutonic attacks. A third option, presented by Polish nobles, avoided major pitfalls of the Teutonic or Muscovite proposals.[6]

The relations between Poland and Lithuania were not particularly friendly. The two states were allies before, when Jogaila's aunt Aldona of Lithuania was Queen of Poland between 1325 and 1339.[2] Poland and Lithuania battled each other in the decades-long Galicia–Volhynia Wars, but also saw opportunities to regain lands lost to Hungary and regarded the Teutonic Knights as the common enemy.[7] It is unknown who and when proposed Jogaila as the groom for Jadwiga. Some hints show that planning and negotiations might have started as early as 1383. For example, Jogaila attacked Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, when he advanced his claims for the Polish throne.[8] By the time Lithuanian envoys participated in Jadwiga's coronation in fall 1384, Jogaila's candidacy was widely known.

In mid-1385, Jogaila sent an official delegation to Poland. It included his brother Skirgaila, Duke Boris (possibly his cousin and son of Karijotas), and merchant Hanul of Riga.[9] Hanul helped Jogaila to recapture Vilnius during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) and represented interests of merchants, who saw great trade potential between Poland and Lithuania.[3] The representatives first appeared before the Polish nobles in Kraków and then before Queen Elizabeth, Jadwiga's mother, in Buda. A Polish delegation – two Elizabeth's envoys and three Polish nobles – was sent to Lithuania.[3] Upon return of the Lithuanian delegation, Jogaila confirmed in writing all the promises, made on his behalf in Poland. This confirmation is known today as the Union of Krewo.

The 560-word document is addressed to Queen Elizabeth and the Polish delegation.[1] Jogaila briefly described the mission of the Lithuanian delegation and, in exchange for marriage to Jadwiga, agreed to the following:

It was guaranteed by the seals of Jogaila's brothers Skirgaila, Kaributas, Lengvenis and their cousin Vytautas.[1] Because the document contained promises and guarantees only by one party, Lithuanian historian Jūratė Kiaupienė concluded that the union could not have been a final international treaty and that there should have been another document finalizing the agreement.[1]

On 11 January 1386 a Polish delegation met Jogaila in Vawkavysk and presented him with a pre-election pact, declaring that the Polish nobility agreed to elect him as their new king.[10] The election was concluded on 1 February in Lublin.[11] On 12 February Jogaila and his relatives arrived in Kraków and were baptized by Bodzanta, Bishop of Gniezno, three days later in the Wawel Cathedral.[12] Jogaila's new baptismal name Wladislaus was chosen in honor of Jadwiga's great-grandfather king Władysław I the Elbow-high, the penultimate Piast. Jogaila married Jadwiga on 18 February and was crowned jure uxoris as King of Poland on 4 March.[10] Due to negative propaganda by William of Austria and the Teutonic Knights, the marriage was not confirmed by Pope Urban VI (1378–1389); only Pope Boniface IX (1389–1404) declared it legitimate.[13]

Right after the marriage and coronation, Jadwiga and Vytautas marched to Galicia where they defeated Hungarian forces and secured some 97,000 square kilometres (37,000 sq mi) in western Podolia.[14] Andrei of Polotsk, Jogaila's eldest brother, used his absence to renew struggle for the throne of Lithuania. Andrei attacked southeast of Polotsk, the Livonian Order attacked Duchy of Lithuania, and Sviatoslav of Smolensk attacked Mstsislaw. The rebellion was quickly subdued.

At the end of 1386 Jogaila returned to Vilnius to carry out his other promise – to convert the Grand Duchy to Catholicism. He brought some priests, established the first seven parishes, and, according to Jan Długosz, even personally translated Lord's Prayer and Apostles' Creed into the Lithuanian language.[15] New converts were baptized en masse, with little teaching, and were awarded wool shirts; the haste was later criticized at the Council of Constance.[16] On 17 February 1387 Jogaila decreed that he would build Vilnius Cathedral and petition the pope to establish the Diocese of Vilnius, which he awarded with land possessions in Tauragnai, Labanoras, Molėtai.[17] Two other privileges, issues on 20 February and 4 March 1387, awarded nobles who would convert to Christianity with new rights and granted Magdeburg rights to Vilnius. This served not only as an incentive for conversion but also equalized nobility rights in Poland and Lithuania.[18]

Jogaila left his brother Skirgaila as his regent in Lithuania. He proved to be unpopular and Lithuanian nobility resented growing Polish influence in the state. Vytautas seized the opportunity to renew his struggle for power and the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) broke out. This was resolved with the Ostrów Agreement – Vytautas became the Grand Duke of Lithuania while Jogaila retained rights of an overlord. Vytautas conducted independent internal and foreign affairs, but cooperated with Jogaila. A celebrated example of the Polish–Lithuanian cooperation was the decisive victory in the Battle of Grunwald (1410) against the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas's independence and Polish–Lithuanian relations were formalized by the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and Union of Horodło (1413). Thus the Grand Duchy of Lithuania retained its sovereignty. Only the Union of Lublin (1569) created a permanent union between Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after which the federal state Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established.

Finally, the Constitution of 3 May 1791 declared that both states were one, albeit that this was denounced in 20 October amendments (the Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations). Soon after, they were separated in form, spending most of the 19th century under Russian control but kept administratively separate. In the early 20th century, both states established their independence and since then, they have had no ties with each other in any formal sense.

Up until the discovery of the original document in 1835 in a register in the Archives of the Cracow Cathedral Chapter, the Union of Krewo was unknown. Usually, important state documents were archived at the Crown Archive. It was neither referenced in any contemporary documents nor cited by medieval historians. No chronicles or other written sources mentioned the August 1385 meeting in Kreva.[1] That led the Lithuanian American lawyer Jonas Dainauskas to question the act's authenticity in 1975. However, his claims have gained little scholarly support.[19]

In the 1385 document, the Latin word applicare, describing a future relationship between Poland and Lithuania, has caused the most controversy and academic debate. The Latin term does not have a legal definition and possibly was deliberately chosen for its vagueness. The term is subject to wide-ranging interpretations, which can be divided into three major categories of meaning:[20]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Krewo

The Articles were the primary constitutional law of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[2][3]

While pacta conventa (a sort of manifesto or government programme) comprised only the personal undertakings of the king-elect, the Henrician Articles were a permanent constitutional law which all King-Grand Dukes were obligated to swear to uphold.[2][4]

The articles functioned essentially as the first constitution for Poland-Lithuania until the Constitution of 3 May 1791.[2][3]

The charter took the form of 18 articles written and adopted by the Polish-Lithuanian nobility in 1573 at the town of Kamień, near Warsaw, during the interregnum after the extinction of the Jagiellon dynasty.[3] The document took its name from that of Henry of Valois, the first Polish king and  Lithuanian grand duke elected in a free election. He was obliged to sign the Articles to be allowed to ascend the throne.[3] Subsequently, every king-elect was required to swear fidelity to them, like the similar documents, the pacta conventa, but the latter were tailored and different for each king-elect.[2] Acceptance by the king-elect of the articles was a condition for his elevation to the throne, and they formed part of the royal oath at the coronation.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrician_Articles

Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic,"The Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR (Lithuanian: Lietuvos TSR Aukščiausioji Taryba; Russian: Верховный Совет Литовской ССР, Verkhovnyy Sovet Litovskoy SSR) was the supreme soviet (main legislative institution) of the Lithuanian SSR, one of the republics constituting the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviet was established in August 1940 when the People's Seimas declared itself the provisional Supreme Soviet. According to the constitution it was very similar to modern democratic parliaments: it was elected every four (later five) years and had the power to create, amend and ratify the constitution, laws, and treaties and appoint officials in the Council of Ministers (the executive branch). However, in reality the elections were staged, the Soviet had very little actual power and carried out orders given by the Communist Party of Lithuania (CPL).[2] The situation changed in 1988, when the Lithuanians began seeking independence from the Soviet Union. The political power shifted from CPL to the Soviet, which adopted a number of important constitutional amendments and laws, paving the way for the independence. The first free elections were held in February 1990 and were won by pro-independence Sąjūdis. During its first session the Supreme Soviet adopted the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania and renamed itself the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania.

The structure and functions of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR were copied from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The sessions of the Supreme Soviet lasted only several days twice a year and decisions were made unanimously and without much discussion. Until the dedicated Seimas Palace was completed in 1981, the Soviet gathered at the Russian Drama Theater of Lithuania.[3]

In between the session the Presidium acted on behalf of the Supreme Soviet. The representatives were elected in general elections every four (since 1975 – every five) years.[4] The elections were held in February 1947, February 1951, February 1955, March 1959, March 1963, March 1967, June 1971, June 1975, February 1980, February 1985, and February 1990.[3] All candidates had to be pre-approved by the CPL, which did not allow any members of the opposition to run. The candidates were selected so that each Soviet had the same proportion of social groups; for example, women comprised about a third of the delegates, factory workers about a half. According to official results, voter turnout reached 97.91% during the 1947 elections.[5] Other elections, except for the one in February 1990, were similarly staged. One delegate represented approximately 10,000 people; thus the number of delegates grew from 180 in 1947 to 350 in 1980.[3]

The chairman of the Supreme Soviet was the presiding officer (speaker) of that legislature.

The presidium was the permanent body of the Supreme Soviet. Its chairman was the de jure head of state. The presidium (chairman, two deputy chairmen, secretary, and 13 other members) was elected during the first session of the Soviet.[7] Formally it had great power while the Supreme Soviet was not in session. For example, it could ratify international treaties or amend laws.[7] However, in reality it was a rubber stamp institution for the CPL and de facto head of state was the First Secretary of the CPL.[2]

The Soviet became an important political battleground since 1988. Inspired and encouraged by perestroika and glastnost, the Lithuanians began taking steps towards independence or at least autonomy from the Soviet Union. The Soviet became the official venue to seek independence in a legal manner. Starting with its 10th session on October 17–18, 1988, the proceedings were televised, hotly debated, and in the center of attention.[8] The political power shifted from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania to the Supreme Soviet, which transformed itself from a rubber stamp institution to an actual legislature. In about a year and a half, the Soviet reinstated interwar coat of arms of Lithuania and national anthem Tautiška giesmė, declared superiority of Lithuanian laws over the laws of the Soviet Union, laid groundwork for de-collectivisation, investigated and condemned events surrounding the occupation of Lithuania in 1940, granted religious freedom, adopted citizenship law, enacted new truly democratic election law reducing the number of delegates to 141, abolished political monopoly of the Communist Party allowing other parties to run in the next election.[8] The delegates struggled with changed duties. About 100 of conservative, pro-Soviet delegates did not attend the sessions. Others, accustomed to blindly following orders from top, voted according to the wishes of the presidium and displayed political immaturity. For example, during a vote to appoint Kazimira Prunskienė as a deputy Prime Minister, 100 votes were cast against her during a secret ballot. When the vote was repeated, this time in public, not a single delegate voted against her and only a few abstained.[8] In August 1989, the Soviet announced that the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact directly resulted in the Baltics being forcibly incorporated into the USSR in 1940. This marked the first time in the country's history that an official Soviet body challenged the authority of Soviet rule.

In February 1990 elections, when for the first time candidates from the opposition were allowed to run, candidates endorsed by pro-independence Sąjūdis won 96 seats out of 141.[9] During its first three sessions on March 11, 1990, the Soviet elected Vytautas Landsbergis as the chairman and adopted the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania. The same day the Soviet changed its name to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania. It is also known as Supreme Council – Reconstituent Seimas (Aukščiausioji Taryba – Atkuriamasis Seimas).

The council held its last session on November 11, 1992. It was succeeded by democratically elected Seimas.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Soviet_of_the_Lithuanian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic

The Nationalist Union won 42 seats, whilst the remaining seven were taken by Young Lithuania, a youth branch of the Nationalist Union.[5] The fourth Seimas first met on 1 September 1936, and drew up a new constitution, which was promulgated on 11 February 1938.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Lithuanian_parliamentary_election

Neminem captivabimus,"Neminem captivabimus is a legal term in  Polish and Lithuanian historical law that was short for neminem captivabimus nisi iure victum (Latin, ""We shall not arrest anyone without a court verdict"").

In the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, it was one of the szlachta's privileges, stating that the king could neither punish nor imprison any member of the szlachta without a viable court verdict. Its purpose was to release someone who had been arrested unlawfully. Neminem captivabimus had nothing to do with whether the prisoner is guilty but only with whether due process had been observed.

It was introduced by King Władysław Jagiełło in the Acts of Jedlnia (1430) and Kraków (1433) and remained in use until the Partitions of Poland (1772–1795). The same acts guaranteed that he would not confiscate any szlachta property without a court verdict.

Lithuanian Diplomatic Service,"The Diplomatic Service of the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos diplomatinė tarnyba) is the part of the governmental service tasked with enforcing the foreign policy set by the President, the Parliament, and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. The head of the service is the Foreign Minister.

Lithuania's diplomacy has extensive roots going back to the era of King Mindaugas, yet modern-day diplomacy of the Republic of Lithuania is believed to have been born on 7 November 1918. On this day, Augustinas Voldemaras, then Prime Minister of Lithuania, assumed the office of the Foreign Minister, thus heralding the formation of the country's Foreign Ministry.[1]

Today, 7 November is celebrated as the Day of the Diplomat.[2] In 1918, Lithuanian diplomacy's goal number one was to achieve de jure recognition of the restored state of Lithuania, and to demarcate its borders. On 23 November 1918, Jurgis Šaulys was appointed Lithuania's first minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary in Germany.[3] On 11 January 1919, Lithuania signed the first international agreement on communication by post was signed with Germany. The second agreement was made with Latvia, granting this country a loan in exchange for the right of Lithuania to use the port of Liepāja for transportation of goods and services.

At the time, the FM was developing its system of diplomatic orders and ranks in accordance with customs of global diplomacy. On 22 May 1920, the following FM functions were established: minister, vice-minister, advisers on church and consular matters, and a General Department and an Information Department were set up. The organisational structure of the FM has changed several times, with the following three departments established on a standing basis in the long run: the Policy Department, the Legal and Administration Department, and the Economics Department. In early 1940, the FM had 218 employees with 123 of them working at the head office and 95 at foreign missions and consulates.[4]

Contemporary diplomatic practice demanded that the ambassador's title only be bestowed on representatives from major states, the highest diplomatic ranks in Lithuania prior to its occupation were envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary. Before Lithuania lost its independence, it had active missions to Berlin, Buenos Aires, Brussels, London, Moscow, Paris, the Holy See, Rome, Stockholm, Tallinn, Washington, Warsaw, Geneva, Prague. The most important achievements during the period of independence for Lithuania were the de jure recognition of Lithuania's statehood.[5] On 12 July 1920, Lithuania signed a Peace Agreement with the Soviet Russia, whereby ""Russia recognizes the autonomy and independence of the State of Lithuania with all the legal implication of such recognition with no reservations, and waives all of Russia's rights of sovereignty it has had towards the people and the territory of Lithuania in good will and for all time"".[6]

One year later, on 14 May 1921 a Lithuania–Latvia agreement was signed in Riga. Under the agreement, Lithuania received Palanga while Latvia received Aknīste and agreed to conclude all territorial disputes. On 22 September 1921,[7] Lithuania was accepted to the League of Nations. Other significant diplomatic achievements were as follows: the signing of the Klaipėda Convention legalizing the annexation of the region to Lithuania between the Republic of Lithuania and the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris on 8 May 1924,[8] the entry into a concordat with the Vatican on 27 September 1927,[9] and the Lithuania–Germany border agreement of 29 January 1928, which legalized the national border after Lithuanian annexed the Klaipėda region. Furthermore, on 12 September 1934, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia signed a cooperation agreement establishing the so-called Baltic Entente.

Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union on 15 June 1940 did not bring the operations of the diplomatic service to a halt, but made the coordination of its activities from Lithuanian soil impossible. National diplomats residing abroad ended their relations with the occupation government of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic and launched a diplomatic campaign for the liberation of Lithuania. In his telegram dated 31 May 1940, the last Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys provisioned that, in the event of occupation, Stasys Lozoraitis, minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Rome, be appointed the head of the Lithuanian diplomatic service. Furthermore, he named Petras Klimas, the minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to France as Lozoraitis' first assistant and Jurgis Šaulys, minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Switzerland, as his second assistant. The Lithuanian diplomatic service became a Government in exile that was a critical piece to ensuring the recognition of the continuity of Lithuanian legal statehood until independence after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.[10]

During the period of occupation, operations of the Lithuanian diplomatic service were heavily burdened as the Soviet Union had taken over some of the mission buildings and parts of Lithuania's gold reserves. Despite protests from Lithuania's diplomats, some states (such as Italy, Germany, Sweden, France) complied with Soviet demands to turn over Lithuanian diplomatic property. On 23 July 1940, US Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles,[11] declared that the US would not recognize the Baltics' incorporation into the Soviet Union on the basis of the Stimson Doctrine. The US thus allowed Lithuanian diplomats to continue to work on its territory in Washington, D.C., New York, and Chicago and refused to surrender Lithuania's gold reserves to the Soviets, however it billed from it for the embassies.[12] France and Switzerland never complied with Soviet requests to transfer the gold, and in 1991 returned the original bars with Smetona's stamp to the Re-Established State of Lithuania.[12] The United Kingdom, despite having closed Lithuania's mission to London, allowed envoy Bronius Kazys Balutis[13] to continue to work in the country as well.

The Lithuanian diplomatic service managed to preserve representation in key Western states until 1990. After the death of Stasys Lozoraitis in 1983, the post of the head of the diplomatic service was assumed by Stasys Antanas Bačkis,[14] minister plenipotentiary to Washington, D.C. On 15 November 1987, he surrendered his position of the chief of the mission to Washington to Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., and returned to Paris.

After World War II, the legation was replaced by the embassy as the standard form of diplomatic mission. However, Lithuania could not receive a U.S. ambassador since its territory was controlled by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Lithuanian legation remained in the form of a legation until the end of the Cold War. By 1990, the three Baltic legations were the only legations remaining on the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic List.[15]

One of the persistent difficulties of the diplomatic service was to obtain funds for its activities. The first few months were financed by funds held on hand, personal loans, and other improvised means.[16] All legations and consulates cut salaries and other expenses, reducing their budgets 3–4 times.[17] In August 1940, diplomats envisioned creation of a special fund, supported by donations of Lithuanian diaspora, particularly Lithuanian Americans.[18] However, the solution was not ideal as the diplomatic service would have become dependent on various political groups of Lithuanian Americans.[19] Therefore, the idea was abandoned when the United States Department of State agreed to allow the diplomats to draw on Lithuanian reserves held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.[20]

Before June 1940, Lithuania had gold reserves in the United States (Federal Reserve), United Kingdom (Bank of England), France (Banque de France), Sweden (Sveriges Riksbank), and Switzerland (Bank for International Settlements).[21] Sweden transferred the funds to the Soviet Union. Initially, England froze the reserves and refused to transfer it to either Lithuanian diplomats or the Soviet Union;[18] however, in 1967, the First Wilson ministry used the reserve in settling mutual claims with the Soviet Union.[22] Swiss bank secrecy laws prevented the transfer of the gold to Lithuanian diplomats.[23] Reserves in France were similarly not available. Thus only the funds held by the Federal Reserve were available: 2,493.61 kilograms (80,171 ozt) of gold reserve and a currency reserve.[18][24][25]

The funds were made available, but were supervised by the State Department and the Department of the Treasury. With limited exceptions, the funds were made available only for the use of American embassies and consulates.[26] Therefore, embassies elsewhere, such as the Holy See, had to be subsidized by the Lithuanian embassy in Washington. Initially, the diplomats drew only on the currency reserve, which sustained the diplomatic service until 1950.[26] The gold reserve, valued at approximately $2.8 million, was sold in 1950 and 1955 and conservatively invested into Treasury bills and diversified industrial shares.[27] The annual budget of the diplomatic service was approximately $100,000. Therefore, the funds lasted until 1980.[28]

Once the funds were exhausted, Lithuanian diplomats and American officials considered various solutions: donations by the Lithuanian community, consolidation or closure of Lithuanian consulates, sale of the embassy building in Washington, direct financing by the U.S. (Representative Charles F. Dougherty introduced HR 5407 to that effect), loan from the U.S., etc.[29] Eventually, a solution was found when State Department brokered a deal with the Latvian diplomatic service, which was much better off financially.[28] Based on a verbal agreement, made on 30 January 1980 between Anatols Dinbergs and Stasys Antanas Bačkis, Latvians agreed to provide interest-free annual loan of $120,000 from investment returns generated on their reserves to the Lithuanians.[30] The last such loan, increased to $148,000, was received in mid 1991. In total, Latvians loaned $1.523 million.[31] The principal of the loan, unindexed and without interest, was repaided by independent Lithuania in 2005.[25][32]

After Lithuania declared the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, steps had to be taken to consolidate the previously exiled diplomatic service into the new national government. A great contribution in this respect was made by surviving diplomats in the US, Vatican, Canada, Venezuela, whom Lithuania still recognized. Shortly, on 17 June, the Foreign Ministry was reinstated,[33] with Algirdas Saudargas appointed its first head. On 11 February 1991, Lithuania's independence was recognized by Iceland, and on 17 September 1991, the country was accepted to the United Nations. One of the first critical diplomatic achievements was the agreement with the Russia Federation laying down the grounds for cross-border relations that was signed on 29 July 1991. Both states undertook to fairly comply with the generally recognized principles and norms of international law in their relationship. The signing of this agreement was followed by yet another achievement: the full withdrawal of the Soviet Armed Forces from Lithuania by 31 August 1993.[34]

On 26 April 1994, the Republic of Lithuania and Poland signed an agreement on friendly relations and good neighboring cooperation, laying down a foundation for the strategic partnership between the two countries. Lithuania's accession to NATO on 29 March 2004[35] was an important factor that consolidated the country's independence; the foundations for the accession were laid in Washington on 1 February 1998, when the US, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia signed a Partnership Charter. The Charter endorsed a common goal of working together to create conditions for the integration of the so-called Vilnius Group into European and trans-Atlantic political, economic, and security structures, including NATO.[36]

Another achievement was Lithuania entering the European Union on 1 May 2004 and the Schengen Area on 21 December 2007. In 2011, Lithuania was the first Baltic state to preside over the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.[37] The presidency helped Lithuania boost its influence in international affairs.[38] In the second half of 2013, the country presided over the Council of the European Union. On 17 October 2013, Lithuania was elected, by majority vote, non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2014–2015 term and presided over the Council in February 2014 and May 2015.

The diplomatic service of the Republic of Lithuania consists of diplomats working at the Foreign Ministry and foreign diplomatic missions of the Republic of Lithuania under the Foreign Ministry including embassies of the Republic of Lithuania to international organisations, consular establishments, special missions, and negotiation groups; diplomats working at the Office of the President of the Republic of Lithuania, the Office of the Parliament, the Office of the Government, ministries, other governmental institutions or bodies as well as diplomats transferred to international organisations or institutions, European Union institutions or bodies, joint European Commission or Council institutions, joint European Commission and European Union organisations, civil international operations or missions, or foreign institutions on a provisional basis, in the manner prescribed by the Law on Delegating Persons to European Union Institutions or Foreign Institutions of the Republic of Lithuania.

The Republic of Lithuania has its diplomatic missions to foreign states and international organisations to maintain official relations with international organisations, enforce the foreign policy of the Republic of Lithuania, and protect the rights and legitimate interests of the Republic of Lithuania, its citizens, companies, and other legal entities. Diplomats abroad also negotiate with the government of the host country, protect the rights and interests of citizens and companies, legally obtain, collect, and transmit to the FM information, promote friendly cross-border relations, disseminate information about Lithuania, and maintain and strengthen the relationship between Lithuanians residing in the host country and Lithuania. Diplomatic missions of the Republic of Lithuania are directly subordinate to the Foreign Ministry.

Lithuania has 29 foreign missions, 41 embassies, 8 consulates general, 3 consulates, 1 embassy office, 7 missions to international organisations, and 1 special mission.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Diplomatic_Service
Lithuanian Tatars of the Imperial Guard,"The Lithuanian Tatars of the Imperial Guard (French: Tartares Lituaniens de la Garde Impériale / Lithuanian: Imperatoriškosios Gvardijos Lietuvos totoriai) were a light cavalry squadron of Napoleon's Imperial Guard, in the service of the French Army from 1812 to 1814. The Lipka Tatars, descendants of Crimean Tatars, were organized into a single squadron at the beginning of the Russian Campaign. Their first commander was Squadron Leader Achmatowicz, who was killed at Vilnius and succeeded by Captain Ulan, who led the unit through the remainder of the war. Following the First Abdication of Napoleon, all foreign units were disbanded, and the regiment followed.

The appellation ""Tartars"" was commonly used in the 17th and 18th centuries, but ""Tatars"" has become the common usage in recent times.[1]

During the 14th century, several families from Tatar tribes in Crimea followed Grand Duke Vytautas to Lithuania, where they served as his personal guard at Trakai Island Castle.[2] After the Polish–Lithuanian union in 1385, the Tatars divided and formed communities in several villages.[3]

Unlike the Christian Lithuanian people, the Tatars were Muslims; they were granted religious freedom and were exempt from taxes, but still had to provide military service.[3][4] In the 18th century, after the Partitions of Poland and Lithuania by Russia, Austria, and Prussia, the Tatars fell under Russian rule. Some Tatar volunteers served in the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw after the duchy's creation by Napoleon in 1807.[3]

In June 1812, General Michał Sokolnicki suggested that Napoleon create a regiment of Lithuanian Tatars. He wrote of ""their probity, as well as their courage were experienced […]"".[4] Despite Napoleon's hopes that the unit could comprise up to a thousand soldiers,[4] only enough Tatar volunteers could be found to form a squadron.[5][3] It was composed of 123 men including 1 squadron leader, 1 major, 4 captains, 7 lieutenants and second lieutenants, and 110 non-commissioned officers and soldiers.[3][4] The squadron also had an imam named Aslan Aley, who also served as a second lieutenant.[6][7]

The unit was officially created in October 1812[8][6] and was placed under the command of Colonel Mustapha Murza Achmatowicz, who paid for the squadron's equipment and uniforms.[5][9] The Tatars were attached to the 3rd Lithuanian Lancers Regiment of the Imperial Guard as scouts.[5]

The squadron participated in the 1812 French invasion of Russia with the 6th Brigade of the Imperial Guard Cavalry (Elite Gendarmes, 3rd Lancers and Tatars).[10] They suffered heavy losses during the invasion, particularly at Vilna from 10 to 12 December where Squadron Leader Achmatowicz was killed[11][12] with 34 of his men.[2] The Tatars also participated in the Battle of Kalish on 13 February 1813.[13] The survivors were first incorporated into the remnants of the 3rd Lancers, which had nearly been destroyed at Slonim in October 1812,[14] and then combined with the Polish Lancers of the Imperial Guard where they formed the 15th Company, considered as ""Middle Guard"". By this time, the Lithuanian Tatars were led by Captain Samuel Murza Ulan[15][16] with lieutenants Ibrahim and Aslan Aley as seconds-in-command, with a total strength of only 53 men.[13]

From April to June 1813, on the recommendations of Colonel-Major Dautancourt, the Captain Ulan tried to recruit new cavalrymen and left for France with maréchal des logis-chef Samuel Januszerwski.[7] Reduced to just 47 men, he was refused foreign soldier reinforcements at Metz and went to Paris to seek support from Minister of War Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke. Unsuccessful, Ulan and 24 recruits returned to Friedberg, Germany, the depot of Polish Lancers.[13]

The Lithuanian Tatars continued to serve under Captain Ulan as part of the Polish Lancers during the 1813 German Campaign, participating in battles at Dresden, Peterswalde, Leipzig and Hanau. The Tatars were then transferred to the 3rd Polish Scouts Regiment of the Imperial Guard and saw further losses during the 1814 French Campaign, having 6 killed and 7 taken prisoner.[13] After the abdication of Napoleon on 6 April, Ulan and the few survivors returned to Lithuania.[8] According to Pigeard, 100 men of the initial 123 died by the end of the campaign.[12]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Tatars_of_the_Imperial_Guard
Manor houses of Polish-Lithuanian nobility,"A manor house of Polish-Lithuanian nobility is called dwór[1] or dworek in Polish and dvaras in Lithuanian.

The architectural form of the manor house evolved around the late Polish Renaissance period and continued until the Second World War, which, together with the  communist takeover of Poland and Soviet occupation of Lithuania, spelled the end of the nobility in both nations. A 1944 decree nationalized most mansions as property of the nobility; few were adapted to other purposes and many slowly fell into ruin. A vast majority of such mansions remain unused and are slowly deteriorating.

Noble manors in Poland were typically small to medium-sized residencies for the landed gentry.[2] According to estimates, in the 16th century, Greater Poland alone had several hundred to a thousand middle szlachta manors, while the entire Crown of the Kingdom of Poland had at least a dozen thousand.[3]

During the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Polish-Lithuanian nobility built manor houses in the countryside. This was a preferred location for one's residence, as the nobility, following the sarmatism ideology, felt contempt for the cities, even though members of this elite also had residences in a major city or town (but these were large lateral apartments rather than townhouses).

The vast majority of such countryside manors in the beginning were made of wood.[4][5] They tended to fall into two types: rare palaces of the magnates, and smaller, one-story houses, in which wood was the most common building material.[5] Starting with the Renaissance period, mansions built with masonwork appeared, often designed to enhance their defensive characteristics.[4][6] Although early on, such mansions were often designed as defensive mini-fortresses, over time - around the baroque period - the defensive function began to disappear.[4][6]

The smallest ones had 2-4 rooms. Larger ones would have many more, including guest rooms and a chapel. Magnates' palaces would even boast their own opera house.[5] Common furniture included benches, cupboards, tables, beds and small chairs, commonly made from tilia wood.[5] Rarer furniture would include chests and wardrobes. Furniture was often painted (green being the most common color),[5] sometimes engraved and inlaid. Walls were often painted with floral or moral and historical motifs, and decorated with Oriental (Persian, Turkish) or West European (Belgian, Flemish, French) tapestries and rugs, coats of arms, portraits, mirrors, weapons and trophies.[4][5] Floors were wooden. Ceilings were carved and decorated with various hanging decorations (including candelabras).[5] Windows in the richest mansions would be fitted with Venetian glass, and the rest would use green glass or waxed canvas.[5] Stoves were common. Depending on a family's wealth, they would be made of materials from rough earthenware to porcelain and alabaster.[5]

Early renaissance mansions were based on a rectangular design, with corner chambers (alkierze) and a porch.[7] The roof was a Polish variant of the hip roof (termed the ""broken Polish roof"" [pl]) covered with shakes.[6] In the baroque period, alkierze were replaced by risalits, and mansard roofs appeared.[4][6] The Classicism period saw porches replaced by porticos with tympanums.[6][7]

Over time, Polish manors adopted a palace-villa form with Baroque and Palladian style elements.[2] As Polish architectural writing developed, their design became more standardized.[8] The first Polish architectural treatise, from around the mid-17 century, included instructions for building early modern manors.[9][a]

Manors were constructed across Poland not only in rural areas but also in cities, particularly in Warsaw, where they remained the most popular type of residence from the 17-18th centuries until the 1830s.[11]

Since the 19th century, richer residences (palaces) were termed manors (Polish: dwór), while the more modest homes of provincial nobility were called little manors (Polish: dworek).[12]

Many Polish and Lithuanian noble families lost their ancestral manor houses and lands after the failed uprisings against Russian Empire, as Tsarist authorities confiscated manors owned by families who supported the uprisings.[13]

In Lithuania, after the abolition of serfdom in 1861, many manor estates lost ownership of the nearby towns and villages, as peasants were no longer the property of the manor's lord. During the Lithuanian Land Reforms of 1922, almost every manor's land size was greatly reduced and the land was redistributed to landless peasants. After Lithuania was occupied by Soviets in 1944, all manors were nationalized.[13]

In Poland, the ideologically driven nationalization policies and architectural preservation guidelines enacted during the early years of the Polish People's Republic contributed to the destruction of many manors houses.[14] Before WW2, there were tens of thousands of manors. Today, only over 2,000 remain, often in very poor condition.[15]

Manor architecture influenced church buildings and, by the mid-19th century, impacted peasant and small-town architecture as well. Inns and smithies were built in a similar style.[2] In the 17th and 18th centuries, a view emerged that identified the manor architecture with 'Polishness', treating it as 'native' and 'unique'.[16] It gained particular traction in the 19th century during the period of Romanticism,[17] leading to the creation of the dworek style (Polish: styl narodowy or styl dworkowy) — an urban or suburban villa from the first half of the 20th century, in which public utility buildings, such as railway stations, were also designed in Poland.[18] The dworek style design was popular in the Second Polish Republic, and is still inspiring some modern Polish manors.[4][6]

Subdivisions of the Polish–Lithuanian territories following the partitions,"Following three consecutive partitions of Poland carried out between 1772 and 1795, the sovereign state known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth disappeared from the map of Europe. In 1918 following the end of World War I, the territories of the former state re-emerged as the states of Poland and Lithuania among others. In the intervening period, the territory of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was split between the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Russian Empire. These powers subdivided the territories that they gained and created new toponyms for the territories conquered. The subdivisions created were complicated by changes within those empires as well as by the periodic establishment of other forms of the quasi-Polish provinces led by a foreign head of state.

The below subdivisions do not cover the administrative divisions of the French vassal state created by Napoleon - the Duchy of Warsaw. See subdivisions of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815). For the administrative division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before its final third partition, see subdivisions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For the subdivisions of the lands awarded to the Russian Empire, see subdivisions of Congress Poland (1815–1918) and History of the administrative division of Russia. For subdivisions of the lands awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia, see Provinces of Prussia.

The Austrian Empire, known from the second half of the 19th century as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, annexed territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the First Partition (1772) and the Third Partition (1795).[1] The territories obtained were subdivided into:

In the First Partition, the Austrian Empire received the largest share of the Polish population, and second largest land share (83,000 km2 and over 2.65 million people). Austria did not participate in the Second partition. In the Third Partition, Austria annexed 47,000 km2 of territories with 1.2 million people. Overall, Austria gained about 18 percent of the former Commonwealth's territory (130,000 km2) and about 32 percent of its population (3.85 million people).[1] From the geographical perspective, much of the Austrian partition corresponded to the Galicia region.

The Kingdom of Prussia (known from second half of the 19th century as German Empire) annexed territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in all three partitions.[1] The territories obtained were subdivided into the following.[2]

In the First Partition, Prussia has received 36,000 km2 and about 0.6 million people. In the second partition, Prussia had received 58,000 km2 and about 1 million people. In the third, similar to the second, Prussia gained 55,000 km2 and 1 million people. Overall, Prussia had gained about 20 percent of the former Commonwealth territory  (149 000 km2) and about 23 percent of the population (2.6 million people).[1] From the geographical perspective, much of the territories annexed by Prussia formed the province of Greater Poland (Wielkopolska).

The Russian Empire which acquired the territories of the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in all three Partitions,[1] divided the former territories of the Commonwealth by either creating or enlarging the following guberniyas.[2]

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Russian Empire created a separate entity called Congress Poland. See administrative division of Congress Poland for details. Territories in the Russian partition which were not incorporated into Congress Poland were known as the Western Krai (combination of Northwestern and Southwestern Krais), and in Poland as the taken lands (Polish: ziemie zabrane).

The Western Krai comprised the following lands of the Commonwealth:

It consisted of 9 guberniyas: six Belarusian and Lithuanian ones that constituted the Northwestern Krai (Vilna Governorate, Kovno Governorate, Grodno Governorate, Minsk Governorate, Mogilev Governorate and Vitebsk Governorate) and three Ukrainian ones that constituted the Southwestern Krai (Volhynia Governorate, Podolia Governorate and Kiev Governorate).

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was transformed into Courland Governorate (Government of Courland) and grouped with the Baltic governorates also known as Governments of Ostsee.

In the first partition, Russia gained 92,000 square kilometres (36,000 sq mi) and 1.3 million people. In the second, 250,000 km2 and 1 million people. In the third, 120,000 km2 and 1.2 million people. Overall, Russia had gained about 62 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (462,000 km2) and about 45 percent of the population (3.5 million people).[1]

During World War I (1914–1918), much of the territories became occupied by the Central Powers (primarily, German Empire) and became administered by the Ober Ost.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_the_Polish–Lithuanian_territories_following_the_partitions

Anti-Lithuanian sentiment,"Anti-Lithuanian sentiment (sometimes known as Lithuanophobia)[1] is the hostility, prejudice, discrimination, distrust, racism or xenophobia directed against the Lithuanian people, Lithuania or Lithuanian culture. It may also include persecution, oppression or expulsion of Lithuanians as an ethnic group.

Some Belarusian academics are known for engaging in historical negationism and trying to culturally appropriate Lithuanian culture, national identity and history of statehood by arguing that the Belarusian word litoutsy (літоўцы), meaning ‘Lithuanian’, historically refers to modern Belarusians instead whereas present-day Lithuanians are pretenders who should actually be identified as letuvisy (летувicы) and are accused of stealing their ethnonym as well as the historic name of their homeland.[2][3] Some Belarusian scholars consider the statehood of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to be primordially Slavic, rejecting the notion that its origins come from Baltic Lithuanian tribes. Historian Mikola Yermalovich claimed that King Mindaugas was Belarusian whereas the epicentre of historic Lithuania was actually in central and southern Belarusian lands.[4]

During the Belarusian opposition protests in 2021, a Lithuanian woman was arrested and beaten up by Belarusian OMON forces after they found out she was a Lithuanian citizen.[5]

In 2023, statistics from the previous year alone indicated that a significant number of Lithuanians were exploited or faced discrimination at work in Belgium with Federal Public Service Employment getting around 400 complaints: 168 of cases were from Lithuanians who did not receive their paycheck or it got delayed whereas 234 of them received smaller payments than their coworkers for the same work because of their background. There were also accounts of Lithuanians facing racist or humiliating comments such as being called ‘dirty’, ‘Eastern European’ or noted as coming ‘from the Soviet Union’ in their certificate of employment.[6][7]

In 2007, a scandal began to surface as it emerged that some Irish schools forbid Lithuanian children from using their native tongue. There was a reported case of Lithuanian girls suffering physical abuse because they were considered to be more attractive than their Irish peers. Inspector for Children’s Rights Rimantė Šalaševičiūtė stated that “Lithuanian children are feeling unsafe and face discrimination” and concluded that Lithuanian and Irish children were not being treated as equals.[8] In 2008, three Lithuanian men were beaten up because of their nationality by bouncers who claimed that people like them are not welcomed.[9]

After the creation of the German Empire in 1871, the population of Prussian Lithuanians in East Prussia started to decline even further due to Germanisation. Many Lithuanians who wanted a better life were forced to adopt German culture and eventually abandoned their native tongue. In Prussian governance and within the clergy, German colonists were regarded as the emissaries of ""the chosen people"" tasked with the mission of Germanizing the Lithuanians as well as other ethnic groups. Prominent officials consistently underscored national disparities in their writings, characterizing the Lithuanian peasantry as belonging to an inferior human race predestined to serve the Germans as their slaves.[10] They also believed their culture being superior to Lithuanian culture whereas the nation itself was considered to be politically inept. In 1916, a German science publication Der Koloss aut fonernen Fusen in Munich wrote:

[T]he Lithuanian himself has a tendency to superior German culture and by taking this path, he can become a loyal citizen of the Reich. [...] those who think that a Lithuanian is already mature enough for even the most primitive form of self-governance are deeply mistaken.[11]

During World War II, in accordance with Generalplan Ost, the Nazis planned to commit a mass-scale genocide of Lithuanians — 85% were to be physically exterminated, which was the second-highest percentage of planned killings of an ethnic group in German-occupied Europe only to be surpassed by Latgalians.[12]

Historically, Lithuanians in Latvia were called leiši, which apart from its primary meaning was also used to refer to someone who is negligent, lazy, uneducated and illiterate. Following Latvia’s declaration of independence, this term was soon replaced by a neologism lietuvieši due to its negative connotations and official complaints from the Lithuanian Government regarding the designation of the nationality of their compatriots in Latvian passports. Philologist Aistė Brusokaitė suggests that Latvians were the first ones to call Lithuanians zirga galva, meaning 'horse head', which was later adopted as an insult by Lithuanians themselves:

Since Latvians were economically more well off than Lithuanians, Latvians that lived by the border used to take young Lithuanian workmen to serve on their farms to do all the dirty work. Latvians were Lutherans and Lutherans always paid more attention to education. Because of this, Latvians were more educated than Lithuanians, which is why less educated, illiterate Lithuanians were sometimes looked down upon and called ‘zirga galva’.[13]

Before World War II, the Government of Latvia closed Lithuanian organisations and schools, which contributed to many Lithuanians fleeing the country as they could no longer ensure proper education for their children. In the 1950s and 60s, however, economically struggling Lithuanians were once again resettling in Latvia where they faced some degree of discrimination from the locals who did not consider them to be equal or trustworthy. There were reported cases of inciting tensions and insults directed at the Lithuanian people as well as children bullied at school for having Lithuanian parents.[14]

The earliest depiction of Lithuanians, found in the few sources dating back to the 13th century, is decidedly negative. They were portrayed as semi-wild, greedy, and cruel pagans.[15] This stereotype emerged as a result of numerous Lithuanian raids on Polish lands, which continued until the end of the 14th century.[15] It was largely repeated by the chronicler Jan Długosz in the 15th century, who was also the first to attribute honorable Roman origins to the Lithuanians.[15] During the Polish-Lithuanian Union, interactions primarily took place at the level of the nobility. The Lithuanian nobility gradually adopted the Polish language and cultural elements, yet they were often perceived by the Polish nobility as uncouth and poor. Lithuanians were viewed as stubborn, distrustful, and cunning.[16] Despite this, they were treated as ""one of us.""[17] The Lithuanian nobility, on the other hand, regarded the Crown nobility as arrogant braggarts prone to megalomania and fond of drunkenness, referring to them as ""monkeys.""[18] By the 18th century, there was a widespread belief in Lithuania that the Lithuanian nobility spoke Polish better than the Crown nobility.[18] The common Lithuanian people, as well as the lower nobility, often referred to as Samogitians (Polish: Żmudzini), were considered by Poles as barbaric and semi-pagan, speaking an incomprehensible, ""bird-like"" language.[17]

In the 19th century, ethnographers and researchers became increasingly interested in the simple Lithuanian folk, who, unlike the nobility, did not use the Polish language in their daily lives.[19] This interest was connected with the ""mythologization of Lithuania"" in Polish literary culture, which portrayed Lithuania as a land of peace and tolerance, where robust, simple folk lived in harmony with the Polish manor.[20] In the Polish language, a term analogous to ""chłopomania"" (lit. 'peasant mania') appeared: ""litwomania"" (lit. 'Lithuania mania') referring to obsessive fascination with peasant Lithuanian identity.[21]

The term took on a pejorative connotation when the Lithuanian national movement emerged, which generally viewed Polish influence in Lithuania negatively.[22] One of its demands was for Polish-speaking Lithuanians to return to the language of their ancestors and embrace an ethnic Lithuanian identity.[23] In response, a historical theory emerged, claiming that a significant portion of Lithuania's inhabitants had Polish origins, being descendants of thousands of captives brought to Lithuania during the Middle Ages. This theory originated in the early 20th century, primarily in the writings of historians Władysław Abraham and Zygmunt Gloger. Although challenged by subsequent generations of historians, it persisted until the second half of the 20th century.[24]

In Polish public opinion, there was often a lack of understanding regarding the emerging Lithuanian movement, which was perceived as a harmful division of the Polish-Lithuanian community. Many saw it as a Russian, and later also as a German, conspiracy.[25] Litwomans were often perceived as renegades, deliberately abandoning Polish culture and language.[26] The possibility of Lithuanian culture functioning independently of Polish culture was frequently questioned.[27] These traits were most evident in the writings of Poles living in Lithuania. Among them, it was common to deny the Lithuanian movement the exclusive right to use names like ""Lithuania,"" ""Lithuanians,"" and ""Grand Duchy of Lithuania,"" as they felt themselves to be, at the very least, equal heirs to this legacy.[28] Particularly in conservative and national circles, there was a dominant belief in the artificiality of Lithuanian national aspirations, which were seen as lacking any solid linguistic or historical foundations.[29] The entire matter was often reduced to temporary social tensions between the peasant class and the nobility. For a long time, Lithuanian activists, and later the Lithuanian nation, were regarded as ""younger, misguided brothers"" who would eventually realize the obvious mistake of rejecting Polish identity.[30] Despite the growing tension and new areas of conflict, a lasting anti-Lithuanian sentiment did not develop during this period. Lithuanians were still seen as a close and friendly group, with all negative traits attributed to a group of Lithuanian activists detached from reality.[30]

The conflict over the auxiliary language (in addition to Latin) in churches within parishes inhabited by both Polish- and Lithuanian-speaking populations, which took place between 1904 and 1914, had a significant impact on the formation of mutual stereotypes.[31] Many nationally-minded Lithuanian priests demanded a greater presence of the Lithuanian language, which often met with resistance from the broader clergy, who were attached to the role of the Polish language in the Catholic Church in Lithuania.[32]

On June 23, 1944, in response to the Glinciszki massacre, which was a Lithuanian revenge campaign for killing their auxiliary policemen, the Polish resistance movement Home Army killed up to 100 Lithuanian civilians [33] in the Dubingiai massacre. The victims included newborns, children, women and the elderly. They also killed 273 Lithuanians in Molėtai from 1943 to 1945.[34]

In 2013, during a football match between Lech Poznań and Žalgiris clubs in Poznań, Lech fans publicly hanged up a banner, saying “Lithuanian boor, kneel before the Polish master” (Polish: Litewski chamie, klęknij przed polskim panem).[35] Thousands of Poles signed a letter of apology on Gazeta Wyborcza following the incident claiming that “in Poland, there’s no place for such primitive behaviour that insults the Lithuanian nation.”[36]

After the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, most of Lithuania proper fell under Russian rule. From the early 19th century, Russian ethnic policies concerning annexed land were different: unlike in Poland, Latvia, Estonia or Finland where Russians imposed more mild integration policies mainly seeking to turn them into loyal subjects of the state, Lithuanians together with Belarusians and Ukrainians faced assimilation.[37] The unsuccessful January Uprising (1863–64) resulted in Governor General Mikhail Muravyov initiating the Programme of Restoration of Russian Beginnings that claimed Lithuanian land being Russian since ancient times.[38] In 1863, Lithuanian publications in Latin script were banned. From 1872, only the Cyrillic script was allowed and Lithuanian was banned in schools.[37]

Following the occupation of East Prussia, around 130,000 Prussian Lithuanians suffered from ethnic cleansing as they were slaughtered by the Red Army. Thousands of local orphans also known as wolf children (In Lithuanian: vilko vaikai) were left behind to fend for themselves, with many Prussian Lithuanian children escaping to Lithuania proper by crossing Neman.[39][40] According to the Research Centre of Lithuania, “In Lithuania Minor and all of East Prussia, there were almost no settlements where the Soviets wouldn’t have killed and tortured the civilian population, destroyed or pillaged their property. Men were killed and women were raped.”[41] NKGB officer Kuzmyn in Klaipėda writes:

In Klaipėda and Šilutė there are all-around rapes of women happening, regardless of their nationality, physical stance or age. The beautiful city of Šilutė that was left by the Germans without a battle now looks repulsive.[42]

In 1947, the Council of Lithuania Minor in Fulda, Germany, protested against the ethnic crimes and Russian colonisation of their homeland. Some historians deny accusations of genocide against Prussian Lithuanians, claiming it to be the result of soldier brutality.[40] In 2006, this massacre has been recognised by Lithuania as genocide against the Prussian Lithuanian people carried out by the Soviet regime.[43]

During the Soviet times, the famous slogan “Lithuania shall remain but without Lithuanians” by statesman Mikhail Susnov was coined.[44] Once Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, immediate Russification followed: the Communist Party of the Soviet Union would give administration positions in Lithuanian SSR to Russian representatives who usually could not speak Lithuanian, ethnic Russians were encouraged to resettle in Lithuania. In some governmental institutions of Soviet Lithuania, the Lithuanian language was banned. In 1948, 80% of all communists in Lithuania were Russians whereas only 18.5% of them were Lithuanians with the situation slightly improving after Stalin's death. In 1953, the leadership of the Lithuanian SSR indirectly admitted that there were attempts to Russify Lithuania and plans to eliminate politics of national character. In the 1980s, Russification intensified in public life as well: it was mandatory for the Lithuanian Communist Party to report on their progress regarding Russification. From 1972, Lithuanian names were started to be written in accordance with Eastern Slavic naming customs as patronyms were introduced.[45]

Similarly to the Soviet Union, modern Russia has also been accused of historical negationism, claiming Kaliningrad to be “primordially Russian land” despite the region sharing much closer cultural ties with its neighbouring countries and being historic Baltic land of Prussian Lithuanians and Old Prussians for centuries. Historical book The Western Part of the Lithuanian Ethnographic Territory written by Professor Pavel Kushner (Knyshev) [ru] exploring Baltic people’s ties to the region has been removed from all libraries of Kaliningrad and mainland Russia with possibly only a few copies in archives remaining.[46]

Lithuanian authorities have received several reports about the unfounded removal of Lithuanian monuments. In 2003, a bust of Kristijonas Donelaitis in Gusev was desecrated with oil paint before its unveiling ceremony — the periodical Kaliningradskaya Pravda did not investigate the incident. In 2022, a memorial plaque in Sovetsk dedicated to philosopher Wilhelm Storost-Vydūnas has been removed. Kaliningrad authorities have also removed a stone sculpture commemorating the famous Prussian resistance leader Herkus Monte.[47]

In the present-day political context, Lithuanians themselves are oftentimes framed as ""nazis"" or ""fascists"" by the Russian state media and press due to the Lithuanian killing squad Ypatingasis būrys carrying out atrocities against the Jewish population during the Holocaust and Lithuanian leadership defending partisans of questionable reputation.[48][49][50] Russian programmes have also come under scrutiny for using deceitful language when spreading false historical narratives about Lithuania: most notable examples include insinuating that Lithuanians served in a national Waffen-SS legion[51][note 1] or labelling Antanas Smetona's regime as ""fascist"", from which Lithuania was then liberated by the Soviets, even though Moscow originally supported its initiators and even funded press publications owned by Nationalists.[52]

In 2015, Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky threatened the territorial integrity of Lithuania by urging Russia to “take back Klaipėda and Vilnius” on national television.[53] In 2022, the State Dume of Russia has registered a bill, which proposes repealing Russia's resolution recognising Lithuania's independence.[54] In 2023, reacting to President of Lithuania Nausėda's encouragement to send more military aid to Ukraine, Russian television host Vladimir Solovyov made claims suggesting that Lithuania is not worthy of its independence, threatened the future of its sovereignty, and asked: “Why do we put up with their existence?”[55]

There have been instances of Russian ethnically motivated violence directed against the Lithuanians living in Lithuania. In 2020, a 24-year-old Russian man who received political asylum physically assaulted a Lithuanian teacher in Visaginas for teaching Russians Lithuanian in school and called Lithuanians ""man-eaters"".[56][57] Lithuanians have also been attacked for addressing Russian speakers in Lithuanian either as pedestrians or clients.[58][59]

Lithuanians have reported facing double standards when seeking to come to the United Kingdom. There have been reports of Lithuanians having to pay £55 more for obtaining a UK visa than citizens from other EU countries. Despite Britain’s official explanation that the larger price is a result of Lithuania not ratifying the Social Charter of the European Commission of 1961, Embassy of Lithuania claimed this decision to be discriminatory and “not fully convincing” as the country did ratify the Social Charter of 1986, which “[f]rom a legal stance, is not a more inferior document.” Post-Brexit amendments affecting labour migration in Britain have also been seen as discriminatory against Lithuanian workers as it will cost much more for employers to employ them in comparison to other nationals. In the words of the representative for IOM Audra Sipavičienė, additional taxes for employers “may contribute to Lithuanians being discriminated against in the labour market. This means there will be no interest in taking a more expensive Lithuanian instead of a cheaper Latvian.”[60] There have been several instances of hostility towards Lithuanian migrants accompanied by property damage although motives for such attacks may vary.[61][62][63] In 2016, a twelve-year-old Lithuanian boy was beaten up in Manchester because of his nationality by his British peer who was ordered to do so by his mother waiting for him in the car. Many Lithuanian families have claimed their children suffered abuse in public schools because of their nationality.[64]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Lithuanian_sentiment

Zenonas Ivinskis,"Zenonas Ivinskis (25 May 1908 in Kaušėnai village, near Plungė – 24 December 1971 in Bonn, West Germany) was a noted Lithuanian historian.

Ivinskis studied at Telšiai and Plungė gymnasiums. In 1925 he entered the University of Lithuania to study philosophy, but later changed the subject to history. In 1929, Ivinskis received a grant to continue his studies in Germany. There, under the direction of prof. Albert Brackmann, he received a Ph.D. for his thesis Geschichte des Bauerstandes in Litauen (English: History of the Conditions of Lithuanian Farmers) in 1932. In 1933 in Gdańsk he was habilitated for his work Lietuvių ir prūsų prekybiniai santykiai pirmojoje XVI a. pusėje (English: Lithuanian and Prussian trade in the first half of the 16th century).

After returning to Lithuania he was drafted into the army. During his free time, he gave lectures at the Vytautas Magnus University and in 1940 became an extraordinary professor. In that year he was invited to work at the Vilnius University. He served as the dean of Faculty of Theology–Philosophy at the Vytautas Magnus University from 1941 to 1942. For his active public defense of university autonomy, the Nazis listed him among other prominent public figures to be transferred to Stutthof concentration camp. Ivinskis was saved from death because he was ill, and was hospitalized for half a year.

In 1944, Ivinskis retreated to the West. Unlike most other Lithuanian refugees, he did not emigrate to the United States and chose to live in Germany. He gave lectures as Gastprofessor at Baltisches Forchungsinstitut in Bonn, and from 1963 taught the history of Eastern Europe at Bonn University. The next year he received his second habilitation in Lithuanian and Polish history and was appointed as a full-time professor. While living in Germany he often traveled to Rome, and conducted research at the Vatican archives. Ivinskis contributed to the Lithuanian encyclopedias published in Boston.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenonas_Ivinskis

Lithuanian Christian Democrats,"The Lithuanian Christian Democrats (Lithuanian: Lietuvos krikščionys demokratai, LKD) was a Christian-democratic political party in Lithuania, which currently exists as a faction in TS-LKD.[2] The party was a member of the European People's Party (EPP) and the European Christian Political Party.

The LKD was established in 2001 by a merger of the Christian Democratic Union and the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, who between them held three seats in the Seimas. A faction opposed to the merger formed a new party, the Lithuanian Christian Democracy Party (Lietuvos krikščioniškosios demokratijos partija), chaired by Zigmas Zinkevičius.

The 2004 elections saw the new party receive just 1.4% of the vote, and lose its parliamentary representation. On 17 May 2008, the LKD merged with the Homeland Union, which was renamed to Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats as a result.[3]

According to the Lithuanian Christian Democrat 2001 election programme the party's primary objectives include increasing welfare spending, strengthening social security and healthcare systems based on social market economy principles and fostering societal education based on Christian values. LKD emphasized the importance of Lithuania's membership in the European Union and NATO as fundamental guarantees for the country's security.[4]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Christian_Democrats

Vilnius Conference,"In the history of Lithuania, the Vilnius Conference (Lithuanian: Vilniaus konferencija) or Vilnius National Conference met on 18–22 September 1917,[2] and began the process of establishing a Lithuanian state based on ethnic identity and language that would be independent of the Russian Empire, Poland, and the German Empire.[3] It elected a twenty-member Council of Lithuania that was entrusted with the mission of declaring and re-establishing an independent Lithuania. The Conference, hoping to express the will of the Lithuanian people, gave legal authority to the council and its decisions. While the Conference laid the basic guiding principles of Lithuanian independence, it deferred any matters of the political structure of future Lithuania to the Constituent Assembly, which would later be elected in a democratic manner.[4]

Lithuania existed as an independent state from the beginning of the 13th century until 1569, when it entered into a union with Poland, forming the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Commonwealth ceased to exist after the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. Most of the Lithuanian territory was incorporated into the Russian Empire. A Lithuanian independence movement arose during the 19th century,[5] based on concepts of national self-determination that were formalized in Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points speech in January 1918.[6]

During the course of World War I, the German Army invaded Russia and soon entered the territory which comprised Lithuania. In 1915, the Germans assumed control and organized a military administration known as Ober Ost (short for der Oberbefehlshaber der gesamten deutschen Streitkräfte im Osten: ""supreme command of all German forces in the East""). At first, the Germans simply exploited Lithuania for the benefit of their war effort.[7] As the war progressed, it became evident that the two-front war that Germany was engaged in would necessitate a compromise peace with the Russian Empire.[4] This necessitated a re-thinking of strategies concerning the occupied territories in the east. An openly pursued goal of annexation gave way to a more guarded policy after Germany perceived that a public relations backlash might occur: the Central Powers realized that the Allies could use such territorial expansion in their propaganda.[8] Lengthy debates between German military leaders (who favored open annexation) and the civilian administration (which leaned towards a more subtle strategy)[9] resulted in a resolution that declared that the military administration governing occupied territories would grant some semblance of autonomy to their populations. The plan was to form a network of formally independent states that would in fact be completely dependent on Germany, the so-called Mitteleuropa.[7]

A Vertrauensrat (""Council of Trust"" or ""Confidential Council"") was authorized in May 1917; its membership was to consist of Lithuanians and ethnic minorities in Lithuania.[8] The military administration approached a number of prominent members of the Lithuanian community, including Bishop Pranciškus Karevičius, Antanas Smetona, and Jonas Basanavičius, all of whom refused to participate in their rubber stamp advisory council.[9] The Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers, an organization that helped war victims and mobilized political activists,[7] then entered into negotiations between the Lithuanians and the occupational authorities. The Committee demanded that the Germans agree to permit a national convention, elected directly by the people.[10] After lengthy negotiations, the parties reached an agreement that a conference could convene that would represent the Lithuanian aspirations; however no elections were allowed to take place.

The Organizing Committee of the Conference (Ausschuss) met in Vilnius on 1–4 August 1917.[9] At the start of the meeting, the military authorities presented an ultimatum that any future conferences would need to declare loyalty to Germany and agree to annexation.[8][9] Since no elections had been held the representatives had to be invited by the Organizing Committee, which included Mykolas Biržiška, Petras Klimas, Antanas Smetona, Jonas Stankevičius, and Jurgis Šaulys.[7] The Committee strove to choose representatives from a wide political, professional, and social spectrum. In total 264 representatives were selected, five to eight from each county (Lithuanian: apskritis).[4] 214 of them attended the conference that convened on 18 September 1917, and remained in session until 22 September.

The meetings of the Conference were held behind closed doors and no German representatives participated.[9] A number of speeches were delivered during the early sessions of the council that denounced the German occupation, mentioning forced labor, heavy requisitions, and rampant deforestation.[8] The Conference, however, concentrated on three main questions:[10]

In regard to the future of Lithuania, the Conference announced that an independent state, based on democratic principles, needed to be declared.[4] In response to various schemes to re-create the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania or Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the new state was to be created only in the lands, that were assumed to be ethnically Lithuanian.[7] Lacking real powers to represent the nation (the Conference was not democratically elected by the citizens), it did not specify the foundations of the state or relationships with other countries. These were to be decided by the Constituent Assembly, elected by popular vote.[4] These three principles were echoed by the Council of Lithuania when it declared the Act of Independence of Lithuania.

The national minorities were promised freedom for their cultural needs.[10] In later years national minorities were granted the same rights as Lithuanians and in some cases extra representation in the government: after the war ended, the Council of Lithuania was expanded to include Jewish and Belarusian representatives;[11] the first governments of Lithuania included Ministries for Jewish and Belarusian affairs;[12] in 1920 the Jewish community was granted national and cultural autonomy with the right to legislate binding ordinances;[13] the Russian Orthodox Church received financial support from the government;[13] Germans, concentrated in the disputed Klaipėda Region, were also granted autonomy.[13] The only sizeable group that did not have extra representation was the Polish minority because of intense conflicts over the Vilnius Region.[14]

In response to the ultimatum by the Germans, the following resolution was adopted:[8]

If Germany agrees to proclaim the state of Lithuania before the Peace Conference and to support the needs of Lithuania at the Peace Conference, then the Lithuanian Conference, bearing in mind that in normal conditions of peace the interests of Lithuania incline not so much to the East or to the South as to the West, recognizes the possibility for the future state of Lithuania to enter into a certain relationship, still to be determined, with Germany, without harming its own independent development.

East, South, and West in this context referred to Russia, Poland, and Germany, respectively. This carefully balanced passage was a response to German demands to declare loyalty to Germany. It did not please the Germans and they did not allow the publication of the resolution.[15]

At the end of the proceedings, the conference elected twenty members to the Council of Lithuania to act as the executive authority of the Lithuanian people.[7] The council was empowered to carry out the resolution adopted by the Conference, i.e. to negotiate with the Germans and declare an independent Lithuania.[10] The Social Democratic members of the conference were dissatisfied with the composition of this council, since it included only two members of that party, and of the twenty members, six were Roman Catholic priests. Two of the priests then resigned; their places were taken by Stanisław Narutowicz and Jonas Vileišis.[8] Five months later, on 16 February 1918, the Council of Lithuania issued the Act of Independence of Lithuania.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius_Conference
Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union,"The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (Lithuanian: Lietuvos valstiečių ir žaliųjų sąjunga, LVŽS)[nb 1] is a green-conservative[2] and agrarian[6] political party in Lithuania led by Ramūnas Karbauskis. The party is considered one of the main representatives of the left wing of Lithuanian politics.[11] Lithuanian journalist Virgis Valentinavičius described the party as ""the mixture of the extreme left in economic matters and the extreme right in some social issues, all spiced up with an anti-establishment rhetoric of radical change"".[3]

Following the 2024 parliamentary election, the LVŽS has been in opposition to the Paluckas Cabinet. The party's one MEP sits in the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament. Founded in 2001 as the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union, (Lithuanian: Lietuvos valstiečių liaudininkų sąjunga, LVLS), the party's symbol since 2012 has been the white stork.

Formerly participating in the European Parliament group of the Greens–European Free Alliance, it announced its intention to join the European Conservatives and Reformists in 2024.[10]

In December 2001, the Lithuanian Peasants Party (Lietuvos valstiečių partija) and the New Democratic Party (Naujosios demokratijos partija) entered into an electoral alliance known as the ""Valstiečių ir Naujosios demokratijos partijų sąjunga"" (VNDS), which translates to the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union or Union of Peasants and New Democratic Parties was formed.[12] In 2002–03 Lithuanian presidential election party's chairman Kazimira Prunskienė came with 5.04 per cent of the votes in the first round and saved its deposit. In the second round, she endorsed Rolandas Paksas of the Liberal Democratic Party, who won the election.[13]

In the 2004 presidential election (after Rolandas Paksas was impeached), Kazimira Prunskienė narrowly came to the second position (21.25 per cent), but she was defeated in the second round (although, after endorsement of Rolandas Paksas).[14] In 2004 European Parliament election, the party got 7.41 per cent of the votes and won one seat by Gintaras Didžiokas. He joined the Union for Europe of the Nations. In Seimas election later tahat same year, the party got 6.6 per cent of the votes. The Labour Party joined forces with Peasants and New Democratic Party Union and invited the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania to join.[15] Brazauskas initially ruled out a coalition with Labour,[16] but eventually Social Democrats and New Union (Social Liberals) joined forces with the Labour Party and the Peasants, with Brazauskas as the Prime Minister.[17]

In February 2006, the Peasants and New Democratic Party Union led by Lithuanian politician Kazimiera Prunskienė chose to rename itself the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union (after the pre-war Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union).

In 2008 parliamentary election the party felt below 5 per cent threshold and was left with three members, who were elected in single-member constituencies.

In 2009 Kazimira Prunskienė left the party and founded the party of her own (Lithuanian People's Party).[18] Although it was a minor party, it gained some influence in 2010 when it supported the Homeland Union-led government. The Lithuanian Peasants Popular Union changed its name to the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union in January 2012.

The party emerged as a dark horse in the electoral race in the spring of 2016. The rise of support was attributed to the popularity of Karbauskis, who had been active in campaigning against alcohol, and their lack of involvement in political scandals.[19] LVŽS was further boosted by the announcement that Saulius Skvernelis, a Minister of Interior in Butkevičius Cabinet and one of the most popular politicians in Lithuania, would head the party's electoral list in the elections, without joining the party.[20][21]

After successful performance in the 2016 parliamentary elections, a clarification about its English name format was issued, changing it to Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.[22] Also, after these election the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union became one of the main three political parties in Lithuania (along with the Homeland Union and the Social Democratic Party) at the time.[23]

After these elections, various pundits claimed that the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union could form a coalition with the Homeland Union,[24] but Ramūnas Karbauskis proposed wide coalition between the aforementioned parties and the Social Democratic Party. The Homeland Union's leader Gabrielius Landsbergis himself proposed a coalition between the Homeland Union, the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and the Liberal Movement, although both Ramūnas Karbauskis and the Liberal Movement's leader Eugenijus Gentvilas turned down this offer.[25] Eventually, a coalition was formed between the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union and the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, which lasted until the autumn of 2017.

The party's support gradually declined by 2018 (e. g. in 2019 European Parliament election the party got 11.92 per cent of the votes), although due to the rally 'round the flag effect (caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), its support rebounded. In the 2020 parliamentary election the party won 18.07 per cent of the vote and 32 parliamentary seats.[26] The party has been in opposition since 2020.[27]

After the elections, Ramūnas Karbauskis resigned from his parliamentary seat. After the electoral loss the party (along with the Labour Party) began to support various radical movements on the political fringes (e. g. Families' Defense March and the Lithuanian Family Movement). This position caused disagreements within party and its parliamentary group.

Disagreements had forced a split in the parliamentary group in late summer and early autumn of 2021, and former Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis formed the newly established Union of Democrats ""For Lithuania"" (although this split was speculated by the pundits as early as March 2021).[28] Due to this and the Social Democratic Party's position not to support the opposition coalition, the party lost the position of opposition leader. By the end of 2021, the party started losing members in municipalities' districts (e. g. Lazdijai district municipality mayor Ausma Miškinienė left it along with the almost all LVŽS members in the area).[29]

Aurelijus Veryga, Minister of Health in Skvernelis' cabinet, was put forward as the party's candidate in the 2024 presidential election.[30] In his electoral program, Veryga emphasized his support for traditional values and opposition to same-sex partnerships.[31]

The party participated in the 2024 European Parliament election in Lithuania and aimed to win 3 seats in the European Parliament, up from 2 that it won in the 2019 European Parliament election in Lithuania. It toned down its populist and socially conservative stances and reoriented itself closer to environmentalism and green politics.[32] However, the party won 9.13% of the popular vote (down from 12.56% in 2019) and only won a single seat.[33]

In the 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election, tahe party ran as a joint list with several politicians from the parties Young Lithuania and Lithuania – For Everyone. It caused the Central Election Commission to designate 7 per cent threshold for this party to obtain seats in multi-member constituency. LVŽS passed electoral threshold with just more than 250 votes. After the election joined the agreement with LSDP to form a government on 15 October.[34] In the end, Dawn of Nemunas was chosen a third party of coalition, thus leaving LVŽS in opposition.

After being excluded from the government, LVŽS has formed an electoral group together with its long-standing ally, the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance. In November, Karbauskis addressed his party, expressing his regret of cooperation with conservative politicians such as Ignas Vėgėlė in the 2024 election, and announcing early leadership election in the LVŽS that would take place in early 2025, despite Karbauskis' term expiring in December 2025. Karbauskis stated that he is ready to either continue leading the party, or ""to step down honourably if most of the union members choose another leader"".[35] In January 2025, the party announced that its convention and early leadership election would take place on 1 March.[36] Aurelijus Veryga (member of European Parliament) won the leadership election.

Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union is placed on the left of Lithuanian political spectrum, although with strong populist and socially conservative tendencies.[11][37] The party is described as green conservative, agrarian and social conservative and is considered to be a blend of staunchly left-wing economic policy, environmentalism, and a conservative outlook on some sociocultural issues.[38] Political scientist Ainė Ramonaitė has also described the party as ""right-wing on the moral dimension and left-wing on the economic
dimension"", together with the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance.[39] Economically, the party focuses on the importance of expanded healthcare and social welfare, whereas socially the party campaigns on traditional and Christian values and the need to stop the moral decay of contemporary society.[40] Its economic ideology has been described as social-democratic,[41] or akin to social democracy.[42] The party is also described as technocratic and agrarian populist.[43]

The rhetoric of the party is based on left-wing populism, prioritizing socioeconomic issues and establishing itself as the representative of the disadvantaged groups of Lithuanian society. Its voter base is composed of rural areas and small towns, and its supporters are mainly the poor, disadvantaged and anti-establishment voters.[44] It criticizes other partes for neglecting the needs of the poor.[45] The LVŽS is not a protest party however - it actively works with other parties and form cabinets.[44] The party appeals to traditional left-wing electorate by stressing the need to reduce social inequality, invest in impoverished areas, and increase minimum wage.[46] It strongly supports trade unions and promotes a union-favourable labor law,[47] demands progressive taxation, and redistribution of wealth from ""business interests"" to ""the people"".[41] The party campaigns on opposition to neoliberal policies, accusing other parties of ""out-liberalizing"" each other in pursuit of ""avant-garde neoliberal policy ideas"" at the expense of vulnerable socioeconomic groups.[48]

The main focus of the party is ""social solidarity and left-wing ideas"".[49] It criticizes right-leaning parties for anti-Russian sentiment as well as following the traditional division into ""ex-communists and anti-communists"".[46] The LVŽS to be neither post-communist nor anti-communist.[50] Socially, the party makes somewhat conservative appeals, pledging to uphold 'traditional' values, fight against alcohol and for ""sober way of living"", and protecting Lithuanian language.[46] It is less conservative on some other social matters - it postulates increased psychological services availability, old-age pensions rise, significant climate action via preservation, agricultural reform against large landowners, and environmental education.[50] The party is regarded as moderate in its social conservatism.[51]

Throughout its existence, the party has evolved from a purely agrarian party to a left-wing populist one, full of eclectic tendencies. Starting out as the farmer-focused Lithuanian Peasant Union (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Valstiečių Sąjunga) in the early 1990s, LVŽS was later renamed the Lithuanian Peasant Party (Lithuanian: Lietuvos valstiečių partija) and started broadening its program beyond agricultural issues, joining forces with the Lithuanian Women Party (Lithuanian: Lietuvos moterų partija) in 1995. In the early 2000s, the Lithuanian Peasant Party was becoming increasingly left-wing, leading to the change of its name to the  Lithuanian Peasant People’s Party (Lithuanian: Lietuvos valstiečių liaudininkų partija) in 2005, which was to highlight both the leftwards turn of the party and to connect itself to the interwar peasant movements in Lithuania.[3]

In 2012, the party was renamed again to the Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, after its leader Ramūnas Karbauskis steered the party towards green politics, strongly promoting renewable energy and campaigning against nuclear power plants. This led the party to combine both agricultural interests and elements of green politics, which at the time was condemned as a 'somewhat schizophrenic' political mix. At the same time, led by Karbauskis, it initiated the 2014 Lithuanian constitutional referendum, which sought to prohibit the ownership of land in Lithuania to foreign citizens, in violation of Lithuania's terms of membership in the European Union.[52] Karbauskis opposed Lithuania's accession to the European Union before 2004, although the party emphasized its pro-Europeanism during the 2016 campaign.[53] Between 2012 and 2016, the party also adopted right-wing views on social issues. In the 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election, the main message of LVŽS was the need to fight poverty and social exclusion, for which the party blamed economic liberalism and pro-business policies by previous Lithuanian governments.[3]

Economically, the party is described as 'extreme-left' and strongly populist, presenting itself as a party of ordinary people. It is described as social democratic economically.[41][42] LVŽS argues that wealth inequality is one of Lithuania's key problems, contrasting the prosperity of Vilnius and the urban middle class with the impoverished Lithuanian countryside, struggling with high unemployment and lack of prospects. In its ideological manifesto ""The Government Program for Sustainable Lithuania"" (Lithuanian: Darnios Lietuvos Vyriausybės programa), LVŽS declared: ""Addressing regional poverty and exclusion must become a priority task for the new government. Recognising that the economic cause of high unemployment and emigration is relatively low wages, we will take swift and effective measures to increase the income of the population, while at the same time striving to ensure an adequate social safety net."" Accentuating the agrarianism of the party, the program also put heavy importance on ""preserving the vitality of the Lithuanian countryside"".[3]

LVŽS defines an economy that would prioritize the 'common man' as its goal, emphasizing the need to implement worker-friendly reforms in healthcare and education, a significant increase in wages and pensions, and the drastic revision of Lithuania's labour code, which the party has denounced as pro-business. The party has pledged to create a state-owned pharmacy network and sharply reduce drug prices, and initiated an anti-alcohol campaign, which it implemented by increasing excise duty on alcohol, raising minimum drinking age to 20, introducing a total ban on alcohol advertising and establishing a state monopoly on alcohol trade.[3] The party is also strongly pro-union, and was praised for improving social dialogue between the state and the unions, and implementing a number of union-favourable collective agreements in the public sector. It also promotes public awareness and the visibility of trade unions, and encourages workers to join them.[47] The party also postulated a ban on land sales to foreigners.[54]

One of the party's main economic goals is to replace the privatization of retirement saving accounts and other welfare programs. After 1991, Lithuania ""zealously embraced neoliberal doctrines"" and became characterized by one of the lowest levels of social expenditure and the highest levels of poverty and inequality among EU Member States; the pensioners were amongst the poorest voting constituencies of Lithuania. LVŽS appealed to the impoverished pensioners for political support and pledged to restructure and nationalize the ""second pillar"" pension program. The party's plan ""mobilized a number of powerful and vocal constituencies such as the banking, life insurance, private pension fund industries, as well as business lobbying groups that had high stakes in pension reform.""[48]

The party's program emphasises a commitment to establishing a ""strong family"" as the core of Lithuanian society. It also strongly praises the Catholic Church and its teachings, and opposes abortion, same-sex partnerships and assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of the Catholic faith. Despite this, in the twelfth Seimas, the LVŽS was a big tent in regards to social issues, and some of its members such as Dovilė Šakalienė and Tomas Tomilinas[55] were strong supporters of feminism, minority rights and civil partnerships for same-sex couples.[3] Since the 2020 election, the party has increasingly turned socially conservative, especially after its more liberal members of the Seimas joined the Union of Democrats ""For Lithuania"". The party's vice-chairman Tomas Tomilinas was expelled from the party in 2021 for voting in favor of same-sex partnerships.[56]

Given the social conservatism of the LVŽS and its emphasis on Christian values, traditional family and preservation of national identity, its rule was compared to that of Polish Law and Justice or Hungarian Fidesz. However, unlike these parties, LVŽS did not mark a break with the liberal course of the European Union. Ukrainian political scientist Nataliya Khoma argues that the social conservatism of the party is moderate, stating that LVŽS ""bypassed the issue of sexual minority rights"" and despite promoting conservative values, the party did not adopt ""a radical platform that exacerbates this issue"".[51]

LVŽS's success in the 2016 parliamentary election has been compared to the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election. According to Virgis Valentinavičius, both Trump and Karbauskis constructed a narrative of 'us against them', opposing themselves against the elite, in spite of both being among the wealthiest people in their respective countries, and both also shifted the blame for their early scandals to the media and the conspiracy of the establishment.[3]

In December 2023, the party took part in a meeting called ""The family of European Conservatives is expanding"" organized by the European Conservatives and Reformists.[57]

In the 2024 European Parliament election in Lithuania, the party focused on the environmental issues and promoted green politics, and toned down its socially conservative policies.[32] After the election, however, it joined the right-wing and Eurosceptic ECR Party.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Farmers_and_Greens_Union

Morta of Lithuania,"Morta (died in 1263) was Queen of Lithuania (1253–1262) upon the accession of her husband, King Mindaugas. Very little is known about her life. Probably, Morta was Mindaugas' second wife as Vaišvilkas, the eldest son of Mindaugas, was already a mature man active in international politics when Morta's sons were still young and dependent on the parents.[1] After her death, Mindaugas married her sister, the wife of Daumantas. In revenge, Daumantas allied with Treniota and assassinated Mindaugas and two of Morta's sons in 1263.

Her pagan name is unknown. The only clue into her origin or birthplace is a short mention in the comments following the treaty signed in 1219 between the Lithuanian dukes and Galicia–Volhynia.[2] It says that Mindaugas killed many members of the Bulaičiai family, including Vismantas, whose wife Mindaugas took for himself. The Hypatian Codex elaborates that Vismantas was killed in 1251–1253 during an attack against Vykintas' castle (often assumed to be in Tverai).[2] It is generally assumed that Morta was Vismantas' wife. Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius analyzed toponyms and determined that the Bulaičiai family most likely hailed from the Šiauliai region. Based on this extrapolation, residents of Šiauliai call the city home of Morta.[2]

In the 16th-century Preussische Chronik, it is mentioned that Morta was actually from Sweden since at the time it was a common practice for pagan rulers who were seeking the throne to marry Christian brides from foreign countries. However, historians consider this claim to be untrue, suggesting that German chroniclers only thought so because they could not believe that a Lithuanian pagan could be such a fierce defender of Western Christianity.[3]

Morta's life is briefly described in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle. The Chronicle paints an image of a capable woman who advised her husband in political affairs and even provides several colorful dialogues between her and Mindaugas.[4] According to the Chronicle, she supported Lithuanian conversion to Christianity, opposed Treniota, and defended the Christians when Mindaugas relapsed to his pagan faith. Taking into account her support to the Christians and the fact that her pagan name is unknown, Rimvydas Petrauskas proposed that perhaps Morta was baptized earlier than Mindaugas (he was baptized c. 1252 by the Bishop of Chełmno).[4]

The written sources contain little information on Morta's family and it is not entirely clear how many children she had. Two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, are mentioned once in an act dated August 7, 1261. The act, by which Mindaugas granted all of Selonia to the Livonian Order, could be a medieval forgery by the Order.[1] According to the Hypatian Codex, two sons, Rūklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas in 1263. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these were the same two sons, whose names were distorted by medieval scribes, or whether there were four sons.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morta_of_Lithuania

Vytautas the Great,"Vytautas the Great (/vɪˈtaʊtəs/; c. 1350 – 27 October 1430) was a ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1][2][a] He was also the prince of Grodno (1370–1382), prince of Lutsk (1387–1389), and the postulated king of the Hussites.[5]

In modern Lithuania, Vytautas is revered as a national hero and was an important figure in the national rebirth in the 19th century. Vytautas is a popular male given name in Lithuania. In commemoration of the 500-year anniversary of his death, Vytautas Magnus University was named after him. Monuments in his honour were built in many towns in independent Lithuania during the interwar period from 1918 to 1939. Vytautas knew and spoke the Lithuanian language with his cousin Jogaila.[6][7][8]

Vytautas' uncle Algirdas had been Grand Duke of Lithuania until his death in 1377. Algirdas and Vytautas' father Kęstutis had ruled jointly in the form of diarchy, with Algirdas governing the east and Kęstutis the west, primarily responsible for defense against the Teutonic Order. Algirdas was succeeded by his son Jogaila, and a struggle for power ensued. In 1380, Jogaila signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės with the Teutonic Order against Kęstutis. When Kęstutis discovered this in 1381, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and made himself Grand Duke. However, Jogaila escaped and raised an army against Kęstutis. The two sides confronted each other but never engaged in battle. Kęstutis was ready to negotiate, but he and Vytautas were arrested and transported to Kreva Castle. One week later, Kęstutis was found dead. Whether he died of natural causes or was murdered is still a matter of debate.

In 1382, Vytautas escaped from Kreva and he sought help from the Teutonic Order, who were negotiating with Jogaila at the time. Jogaila and the Order agreed to the Treaty of Dubysa, by which Jogaila promised to accept Christianity, become an ally of the Order, and give the Order part of Samogitia up to the Dubysa River. However, the treaty was never ratified and in summer 1383, the war between Jogaila and the Order resumed. Vytautas was baptised as a Catholic, receiving the name of Wigand (Lithuanian: Vygandas). Vytautas participated in several raids against Jogaila. In January 1384, Vytautas promised to cede part of Samogitia to the Teutonic Order, up to the Nevėžis River, in return for recognition as Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, in July of the same year, Vytautas broke with the Order and reconciled with Jogaila. He then burned three important Teutonic castles, and regained all Kęstutis' lands, except for Trakai.

In 1385, Jogaila concluded the Union of Krewo with Poland, under which he married Jadwiga of Poland and became King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło.
Vytautas participated in the Union and in 1386 was rebaptised as a Catholic, receiving the name Alexander. In 1386, Vytautas paid homage to Jogaila after his coronation as king of Poland.[9]

Jogaila left his brother Skirgaila as regent in Lithuania. However, Skirgaila was unpopular with the people, and Vytautas saw an opportunity to become Grand Duke. In 1389, he attacked Vilnius but failed. In early 1390, Vytautas again allied with the Teutonic Order through the Treaty of Königsberg (1390).[10] Vytautas had to confirm his agreement of 1384, and cede Samogitia to the Order. His army now invaded Lithuania.[citation needed] Also, to gain more influence, Vytautas married his only daughter Sophia to Vasili I of Moscow in 1391.[10]

The Polish nobles were unhappy that their new king spent too much time on Lithuanian affairs. It was clear that the war could continue for years and would not benefit Poland. In 1392, Jogaila sent Henry of Masovia with an offer to make Vytautas regent instead of Skirgaila. Vytautas accepted and again broke with the Order. He burned three Teutonic castles and returned to Vilnius. Jogaila and Vytautas signed the Astrava Treaty in which Vytautas recovered all Kęstutis' lands, including Trakai, and was given more. Vytautas would rule Lithuania in the name of Jogaila. After Vytautas' death, all his lands and powers would revert to Jogaila.

Vytautas continued Algirdas' vision to control as many Ruthenian lands as possible. Much of the territory was already under the Grand Duke's rule, but the rest was controlled by the Mongols. Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde, sought help from Vytautas when he was removed from the throne in 1395 after his defeat by Timur. An agreement was reached that Vytautas would help Tokhtamysh to regain power, and the Horde would cede more lands to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in return. In 1398, Vytautas' army attacked a part of the Crimea and built a castle there. Now Lithuania spanned from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. A number of Tatar captives were brought to ethnic Lithuania.

Continuing attempts on the part of Poland to subordinate Lithuania drove Vytautas for the third time into the arms of the Order, and by the Treaty of Salynas in October 1398, Vytautas, who now styled himself Supremus Dux Lithuaniae, ceded his ancestral province of Samogitia to the knights, formed an alliance with them for the conquest and partition of Pskov and Novgorod the Great.[10]

Inspired by his successful campaign against Timur, Vytautas and Jogaila won support from Pope Boniface IX for organising a crusade against the Mongols. This political move also demonstrated that Lithuania had fully accepted Christianity and was defending the faith on its own, and that the Teutonic Knights had no further basis for attacks against Lithuania. The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. Over twenty princes, including two brothers of Jogaila, were killed, and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This came as a shock to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland. A number of territories revolted against Vytautas, and Smolensk was retaken by its hereditary ruler, George of Smolensk, and not re-conquered by Lithuanians until 1404. Vytautas waged a war in 1406–1408 against his son-in-law Vasili I of Moscow and Švitrigaila, a brother of Jogaila who with the support of the Teutonic Order had declared himself grand prince. A major stand-off between the two armies ended without a battle in the Treaty of Ugra, by which Velikiy Novgorod was granted to Jogaila's brother Lengvenis, and the important city of Pskov to Jogaila's envoy Jerzy Nos, the latter settlement a clear violation of the treaty of Raciąż.[11][12] The war with Muscovy ended in December 1408, on terms that made further conflict with the Teutonic Order inevitable, despite Hermann II of Celje's attempt to negotiate a solution.[13]

""We do not know on whose merits or guilt such a decision was made, or with what we have offended Your Lordship so much that Your Lordship has deservedly been directed against us, creating hardship for us everywhere. First of all, you made and announced a decision about the land of Samogitia, which is our inheritance and our homeland from the legal succession of the ancestors and elders. We still own it, it is and has always been the same Lithuanian land, because there is one language and the same inhabitants. But since the land of Samogitia is located lower than the land of Lithuania, it is called as Samogitia, because in Lithuanian it is called lower land [ Žemaitija ]. And the Samogitians call Lithuania as Aukštaitija, that is, from the Samogitian point of view, a higher land. Also, the people of Samogitia have long called themselves as Lithuanians and never as Samogitians, and because of such identity (sic) we do not write about Samogitia in our letter, because everything is one: one country and the same inhabitants.""

In the Treaty of Salynas Vytautas had transferred Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights. Samogitia was especially important for the Order because it separated the Teutonic Knights, based in Prussia, from the Livonian Order, based in Latvia. The two orders desired to unite and form a mighty force. However, the knights ruled Samogitia for only three years, because on 13 March 1401, the Samogitians, supported by Vytautas, rebelled and burned two castles. The knights received support from Švitrigaila, brother of Jogaila, who desired to take Vytautas' title. In 1404 Peace of Raciąż was signed, which in essence repeated the Treaty of Salynas: Samogitia was transferred to the Teutonic Knights. Poland promised not to support Lithuania in case of another war. The knights promised to support Vytautas in the east and not to support any Gediminid who could have claims to the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, the treaty did not solve the problems, and all the parties prepared for war.

In 1408, Vytautas reached peace in the east and returned to Samogitian matters. In 1409 the second Samogitian uprising against the Teutonic Knights began, as the rebels burned Skirsnemunė castle. Both Poland and Lithuania supported the rebels. Vytautas gathered a large army from 18 lands under his control. The army joined Polish forces and advanced towards the Teutonic headquarters at the castle of Marienburg (present-day Malbork). In 1410, Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald. The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory. Even though the siege of Marienburg was unsuccessful, the Teutonic Knights never regained their strength and from then on posed a reduced threat to Poland-Lithuania. From now on, Poland-Lithuania began to be regarded in the west as a great power, and Vytautas stood in high favour with the Roman curia.[10]

As a result of the Peace of Thorn of 1411, Vytautas received Samogitia for his lifetime. However, the parties could not agree on the border. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to mediate the dispute. In 1413, it was declared that the whole right bank of the Nemunas (Neman River) was Samogitia and therefore belonged to Lithuania. The Teutonic Knights disagreed and a new war started in 1414. The war lasted for just a few months, and the dispute was brought to the Council of Constance. Even though the dispute was not resolved, the Samogitians had a chance to present their case to the leaders of Europe. It is seen as an important event in the diplomatic history of Lithuania. Several other mediation attempts failed, and yet another war with the Teutonic Order started in 1422. After several months of fighting, the Treaty of Lake Melno was signed. Samogitia was returned to Lithuania in perpetuity, while the city of Memel (present-day Klaipėda) and surrounding territories stayed with the Order. This border, as established by the treaty, remained stable for some 500 years until the Memel Territory dispute of 1923. With peace established, Vytautas could now concentrate on reforms and the relationship with Poland.

In 1399 Jadwiga of Poland and her newborn died in childbirth. Jogaila's power in Poland was jeopardised as he was a foreigner king with no other ties to the throne but his wife. Also, the defeat at Vorskla forced a re-evaluation of the relationship between Poland and Lithuania. The result was the Union of Vilnius and Radom in 1401. Vytautas was granted wide autonomy, but after his death the title and powers of Grand Duke of Lithuania were to be transferred to the king of Poland. In case Jagiełło died first without an heir, the Polish nobility agreed not to elect a new king without consulting Vytautas. The unique feature of this union was that the Lithuanian nobility presented their own document: for the first time somebody other than dukes played a role in the state matters.

Vytautas was one of the creators of the Union of Horodło with Poland in 1413. According to the act of the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to retain a separate Grand Duke and its own parliament. At the same time both the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms were to discuss all the important matters jointly. This union was important culturally as well as politically because it granted Lithuanian Christian nobles the same rights as the Polish szlachta. This act did not include Orthodox nobles. This paved the way for more contacts and cooperation between the nobles of Poland and of Lithuania.

In January 1429, at the Congress of Lutsk it was proposed by Sigismund, king of Hungary, that Vytautas should be crowned King of Lithuania. It resulted in a great crisis between Vytautas, king Władysław and Polish nobles. The envoys who were transporting documents supporting Vytautas's coronation and proposing an alliance between Lithuania, Hungary and the Teutonic Order were stopped at the Polish-Lithuanian border in the autumn of 1430.[17] Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle, ending the whole affair. He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius. The knowledge about his remains has been lost.

According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Vytautas ""was certainly the most imposing personality of his day in Eastern Europe, and his martial valour was combined with statesmanlike foresight.""

Vytautas backed the economic development of his state and introduced many reforms. Under his rule the Grand Duchy of Lithuania gradually became more centralised, as local princes with dynastic ties to the throne were replaced by the governors loyal to Vytautas. The governors were rich landowners who formed the basis for the Lithuanian nobility. During Vytautas' rule, the influential Radvila (Radziwiłł) and Goštautas families began their rise.

In 1398, Vytautas brought over families of the Karaim (388 families) and Tatar peoples. Their principal role was to guard the castle and the bridges, but they also served as translators, farmers, traders, and diplomats. He retains a very high reputation among them, with the anniversary of his death being officially celebrated in 1930 in the kenesa in Vilnius.[18]

Born in 1350 in the castle of present-day Old Trakai (Senieji Trakai), Vytautas was the son of Kęstutis and his wife Birutė. Vytautas was a cousin and childhood friend of Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), who became King of Poland in 1386. Around 1370, he married Anna, who gave birth to Sophia of Lithuania. Sophia was married to Vasily I, Grand Prince of Moscow, and mother and regent to their son Vasili II. After Anna's death in 1418, Vytautas married her niece Juliana Olshanska, daughter of Ivan Olshanski who outlived him.[19] Because of the relationship between the two women, the Bishop of Vilnius was unwilling to perform the ceremony without a papal dispensation; however, Jan Kropidło did not have such scruples and married them on 13 November 1418.[20] According to the 16th century Bychowiec Chronicle, his first wife was Maria Łukomska, however, this is not confirmed by other sources.[20]

A sculpture for Vytautas is display on the Millennium of Russia monument in Veliky Novgorod.

Vytautas appears in several works of fiction dealing with the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the Teutonic Order. He appears in the narrative poem Konrad Wallenrod by Adam Mickiewicz. He was portrayed by Józef Kostecki in Knights of the Teutonic Order, the 1960 adaptation of the famous novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz.

In 2014, a short animation was produced by ""Four Directions of Fairy Tales"" (Cztery Strony Bajek) in association with the Association of Polish Karaims, portraying the Karaim story of Vytautas and his magic horse, with voiceovers in several languages, including Karaim, Polish, English, and Lithuanian.[21]

In the video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Vytautas featured as a cavalry hero.

Vytautas is also mentioned in Jonathan Franzen's fictitious novel ""The Corrections"", which attributes his death in 1430 to Lithuania's gradual downfall as a ""global player"".[citation needed]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vytautas_the_Great

Lithuanian Civil War (1432–1438),"The Lithuanian Civil War of 1432–1438[1] was a war of succession to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after Vytautas the Great died in 1430 without leaving an heir.[2][3][4]  The war was fought on the one side by Švitrigaila, allied with the Teutonic Knights, and on the other by Sigismund Kęstutaitis, backed by the Kingdom of Poland. The war threatened to sever the Union of Krewo, the personal union between Poland and Lithuania.[2] Švitrigaila's alliance with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Paul von Rusdorf, launched the Polish–Teutonic War (1431–1435) but failed to secure victory for Švitrigaila.[5]

When Sigismund seized power in Lithuania by staging a coup in 1432, Lithuania split into two opposing camps, and there began three years of devastating hostilities. To prevent the Knights from continuing their support of Švitrigaila, Poland backed a Hussite invasion of Prussia in 1433.[6] The war ended in a decisive defeat for Švitrigaila and his ally, the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Knights, at the Battle of Wiłkomierz in September 1435. Švitrigaila eventually surrendered in 1437; Sigismund Kęstutaitis ruled Lithuania for only eight years before he was assassinated in 1440.

The Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland had created several tenuous unions in the decades preceding the conflict, including the 1385 Union of Krewo, the 1392 Ostrów Agreement, and the 1413 Union of Horodło. The two states had successfully joined forces against a common enemy, the Teutonic Knights, at the 1410 Battle of Grunwald. The Knights' defeat in the battle weakened but did not completely vanquish their military power and they continued to engage in lesser conflicts.[7] Internal tensions within the tentatively unified state persisted after the battle. While Jogaila (Jagiełło) and Vytautas had converted to Roman Catholicism, the Eastern Orthodox elite, along with some Lithuanian magnates, opposed a closer union with Poland.[citation needed]

On 27 October 1430 Vytautas the Great, Grand Duke of Lithuania, suddenly died without leaving an heir or a will. His coronation as King of Lithuania had been scheduled for September 1430, but the Poles had prevented the crown from reaching Lithuania.[8] Vytautas' only daughter, Sophia of Lithuania, had married Vasily I of Moscow and had only one surviving son, Vasily II. He was Orthodox and could not lead the recently Christianized Catholic Grand Duchy.[9] Their adherence to the Orthodox faith also prevented many other Gediminids from becoming pretenders to the throne. There were two most suitable Catholic candidates: Vytautas' brother and legal heir, Sigismund Kęstutaitis, and Vytautas' cousin Švitrigaila.[9]

The Lithuanian nobles unilaterally elected Švitrigaila as the new Grand Duke.[9] This violated the terms of the Union of Horodło of 1413, wherein the Lithuanians had pledged not to elect a new Grand Duke without the approval of the Kingdom of Poland.[9] At the time Jogaila (Jagiełło), King of Poland and brother of Švitrigaila, was in Lithuania and participated in the funeral of Vytautas. On 7 November 1430, he announced that he approved the election and that Polish–Lithuanian relationship would be formally determined on 15 August 1431.[10] However, an armed conflict erupted due to territorial disputes in Podolia and Volhynia, which, according to the understanding of the Polish nobility, under the terms of a 1411 agreement, were to have been ruled by Lithuania only during the lifetime of Vytautas.[9]

When Polish troops invaded Podolia, Švitrigaila arrested his brother Jogaila, King of Poland, in Vilnius.[11] Jogaila was released when he promised to return Podolia to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish nobility, led by Zbigniew Oleśnicki, gathered in Sandomierz in February 1431.[11] Outraged, they voided the King's promises and demanded that Švitrigaila acknowledge his fealty to Jogaila.[9] Švitrigaila refused, professed full independence, and even asked Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund to send him the crown that had been intended for Vytautas.[12] In the same letter, Švitrigaila promised his loyalty to Sigismund and discussed a possible marriage to a daughter of Voivode of Moldavia.[10]

Švitrigaila began organizing a wider anti-Polish coalition.[13] He negotiated with the Teutonic Knights, with Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, with Moldavia, with the Golden Horde, and with the dukes of the eastern lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[9] The most promising prospect as an ally was the Teutonic Order, which was seeking to undo the Polish–Lithuanian union that had led to the Order's defeat at the Battle of Grunwald (1410).[6] In June 1431 the Teutonic Knights and Švitrigaila signed the Treaty of Christmemel.[9] Švitrigaila's cause was also aided by Moldavian forces led by Alexander the Good, who attacked Poland in the southeast.[13]

On 25 June 1431, the Polish army invaded Volhynia.[11] They captured part of Volhynia, Horodło, Volodymyr-Volynskyi, and Zbarazh, and defeated Švitrigaila's men near Lutsk. However, the Poles did not succeed in capturing Lubart's Castle.[11] At the same time, pursuant to the Treaty of Christmemel, the Teutonic Knights declared war and invaded Poland.[12] Finding little opposition, the Knights ravaged Dobrzyń Land, taking the town of Nieszawa, and tried to move on to the Kuyavia and Krajna regions. However, the Teutonic army was defeated on 13 September 1431 at Dąbki, near Nakel (now Nakło nad Notecią).[14] Švitrigaila, who was besieged in the Lubart's Castle, offered to negotiate peace on 20 August.[11] An agreement was reached on 26 August, thus ending the so-called Lutsk War.[11] A formal truce was signed at Staryi Chortoryisk on 1 September until 24 June 1433.[15] The agreement was more favorable to Poland.[9] The truce did not solve the underlying dispute, however. The war was transformed into a diplomatic struggle, as Poland sought to turn the Lithuanian nobles against Švitrigaila.[15]

In April 1432 at Sieradz, the Poles offered to Švitrigaila the same deal as Vytautas had during his reign: Švitrigaila would be the Grand Duke and Jogaila would be the Supreme Duke and after Švitrigaila's death Lithuanian throne would revert to one of Jogaila's sons.[9] Švitrigaila ostensibly refused the offer crystallizing local resistance.[16] On 31 August 1432, conspirators, including Semen Olshanski, Petras Mangirdaitis, and Jonas Goštautas,[10] attacked Švitrigaila and his escort at Ashmyany, where they were staying the night.[15] Švitrigaila and some of his supporters, including Jurgis Gedgaudas and Jonas Manvydas, managed to escape to Polotsk while his pregnant wife was detained.[16] The conspirators installed Sigismund Kęstutaitis, brother of Vytautas, as the new Grand Duke. It is unclear what groups supported Sigismund or why. Possibly some Lithuanian nobles were displeased with favors that Švitrigaila had granted to the Orthodox dukes, but prior to the coup no opposition had manifested itself.[9] Sigismund, who had not played a major role in Lithuanian politics before the coup,[9] and who had initially supported Švitrigaila,[17] resumed the policy of union with Poland.[12] On 15 October 1432 he signed the Union of Grodno, which in essence confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and granted Sigismund the same rights as Vytautas had enjoyed during his reign.[15] Following Sigismund's death, Lithuania was to return to the King of Poland. Sigismund also made territorial concessions to Poland in disputed Podolia and Volhynia.[17]

To win support from the nobles, in May 1434 Sigismund granted a privilege to both Catholic and Orthodox nobles.[17] The privilege guaranteed their right to buy, sell, exchange, gift, and inherit land. The veldamas, a class of dependent peasants, were released from taxes and obligations to the state—all their earnings now belonged to the nobles.[18] No noble was to be punished or imprisoned for crimes without a court order.[17] Lithuania divided into two camps: supporters of Sigismund (the Lithuanian lands, Samogitia, Trakai Voivodeship, and Minsk); and supporters of Švitrigaila (Polotsk, Vitebsk, Smolensk, Kiev, Volhynia).[9] There began three years of devastating hostilities. On 8 December 1432 the armies of Švitrigaila and Sigismund met in the Battle of Ašmena. Švitrigaila had enlisted the aid of Sayid Ahmad I, Khan of the Golden Horde,[19] and wrote to Pope Eugene IV and Council of Florence hoping to gain their support by promising a church union.[10] He planned to attack the Grand Duchy's capital, Vilnius, and resume the throne.[19] Both sides suffered heavy losses, and final victory went to Sigismund.[13] The Teutonic Order officially observed the truce, but continued its secret support for Švitrigaila, mostly through its Livonian branch.[6]

In June 1433 Poland allied itself with the Czech Hussites in order to stop the Teutonic Order from sending secret support to Švitrigaila via its Livonian branch.[6][20] The Teutonic Knights had supported the Pope and Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund against the heretic Hussites during the Hussite Wars. During their last and largest ""beautiful ride"",[6][21] the Czech forces under Jan Čapek of Sány were also supported by Pomeranian Duke Bogusław IX of the Duchy of Stolp (Słupsk).[22] For four months the Hussite army ravaged Teutonic territories in Neumark, Pomerania, and western Prussia.[5] They attacked Konitz (now Chojnice), Schwetz (now Świecie) and Danzig (now Gdańsk).[23] They captured several towns and castles, including Dirschau (now Tczew) on 29 August 1433.[20][24] Despite their failed siege of Danzig, the Hussites celebrated their ""beautiful ride"" by symbolically filling their bottles with water from the Baltic Sea.[24]

On 13 September 1433 a truce was signed at Jasiniec. Polish–Teutonic negotiations continued at Brześć Kujawski, and Hussite–Catholic negotiations continued at the Council of Florence and at the Czech Diet in Prague.[23] The Polish-led invasion of Neumark and Pomerania had proven successful, cutting the Teutonic Order off from support from the Holy Roman Empire, and convincing the Order to sign a treaty with the Poles.[20] On 15 December 1433, twelve-year Truce of Łęczyca was signed between the Poles and the Order at Łęczyca[20] (leading some Polish historians to divide this Polish–Teutonic War into two wars: in 1431–1433; and in 1435).[25] The Teutonic Knights agreed to most of the Polish demands, including that the Order cease its support for Švitrigaila, each side would control the territories that it occupied until a peace was signed (uti possidetis), and no party would seek mediation by foreign powers in order to alter this truce.[26][27] This marked the end of the war on Polish soil; the struggle on Lithuanian lands would continue for two more years,[28] as the truce with Poland did not extend to the Livonian Order.[26]

In July and August 1433, Švitrigaila and his Livonian allies raided Lida, Kreva and Eišiškės and devastated the suburbs of Vilnius, Trakai and Kaunas.[13] The hostilities were briefly stopped by horse plague.[13] When Jogaila died in May 1434, the Order resumed its backing for Švitrigaila,[29] who rallied his supporters, including knights from the Livonian Order, the Orthodox dukes, and his nephew Sigismund Korybut, a distinguished military commander of the Hussites.[30] In July 1435, Švitrigaila foiled a coup against him in Smolensk.[10] Coup leader Orthodox bishop Gerasim, consecrated as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1432, was burned at the stake.[31] The final battle at Wiłkomierz (Vilkomir, Vilkmergė) was fought in September 1435, northwest of Vilnius. It is estimated to have involved 30,000 men on both sides.[32] Švitrigaila's army, led by Sigismund Korybut, was split by the attacking Lithuanian–Polish army, led by Michael Žygimantaitis, and soundly defeated.[32]

Švitrigaila, with a small group of followers, managed to escape to Polotsk. The Livonian Order had suffered a great defeat, sometimes compared to that which had been inflicted on the Teutonic Knights at Grunwald in 1410.[29][32] On 31 December 1435 the Teutonic Knights signed a peace treaty at Brześć Kujawski. They agreed to cease their support for Švitrigaila, and in the future to support only Grand Dukes who had been properly elected jointly by Poland and Lithuania. The treaty did not change the borders that had been set by the Treaty of Melno in 1422.[33] The Peace of Brześć Kujawski showed that the Teutonic Knights had lost their universal missionary status.[9] The Teutonic and Livonian Orders no longer interfered in Polish–Lithuanian affairs; instead, Poland and Lithuania would involve themselves in the Thirteen Years' War (1454–66), the civil war that would tear Prussia in half.[5]

Švitrigaila was losing his influence in the Slavic principalities and could no longer resist Poland and Sigismund. On 4 September 1437 he attempted to reconcile with Poland: he would rule the lands that still backed him (chiefly Kiev and Volhynia), and after his death these territories would pass to the King of Poland.[34] However, under strong protest from Sigismund, the Polish Senate declined to ratify the treaty .[13] In 1438 Švitrigaila withdrew to Moldavia.[35] The reign of Sigismund Kęstutaitis was brief — he was assassinated in 1440. Švitrigaila returned from exile in 1442 and ruled Lutsk until his death a decade later.[13]

Jogaila's son Casimir IV Jagiellon, born in 1426, received approval as a hereditary hospodar from Lithuania's ruling families in 1440.[36] This event is seen by the historians Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki as marking the end of the succession dispute.[36]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Civil_War_(1432–1438)
Lithuania–United Kingdom relations,"Lithuania – United Kingdom relations are foreign relations between the United Kingdom and Lithuania.

The history of Lithuania's relations with the United Kingdom started on 20 December 1921 with de jure recognition of Lithuania's statehood. The UK became a key export partner. When Lithuania lost independence, the UK officially closed Lithuania's embassy in London but allowed the ambassador to act in this capacity. On 27 August 1991, the UK recognised the restored state of independent Lithuania and soon thereafter transferred to the Bank of Lithuania the frozen gold reserves of Lithuania. On 4 September 1991, the two countries resumed their diplomatic relations.[1] In addition to intensive economic, military, social cooperation, Lithuania and the United Kingdom stand in close cooperation in the areas of education, science, and culture. Currently, there are 8 bilateral agreements regulating the relationship between Lithuania and the UK in various fields.[2]

Although most of the trade between England and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was conducted via Polish port cities, some English merchant ships arrived in the small Lithuanian port town of Palanga in the 17th century.[5]

Lithuania and the UK formally established diplomatic relations on 20 December 1922. During World War II, Lithuania was at various times occupied by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. The UK never recognised de jure the Soviet annexation of 1940. British prisoners of war were among Allied POWs held by the Germans in the Stalag Luft VI POW camp in German-occupied Lithuania.[6]

The UK recognised the restoration of Lithuanian independence on 27 August 1991. Both countries re-established diplomatic relations in October 1991.

The United Kingdom has an embassy in Vilnius and an honorary consulate in Klaipėda.  Lithuania has an embassy in London and five honorary consulates (in Northern Ireland, Northumberland, Scotland, Wales and the West Midlands).

There are around 100,000 Lithuanian people living in the United Kingdom. Both countries are full members of NATO.

The current ambassador to Lithuania is Brian Olley, and the ambassador to the UK is Renatas Norkus.

In 2006, the Queen of the United Kingdom Elizabeth II paid a visit to Lithuania.[7]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania–United_Kingdom_relations
Gothic architecture in Lithuania,"Lithuania is not the very centre of Gothic architecture, but it provides a number of examples, partly very different and some quite unique.

Lithuania, situated at the border of Greek[1] and Roman Church had developed by the defence of its paganism, especially against the Teutonic Order to become a state and in the 14th century a major power.[citation needed] The territory of nowaday's republic, except Lithuania Minor, which was ruled by the Teutonic Order, was the Lithuanian speaking part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, with its Slavic and Orthodox majority of subjects. The centre of power of this large state lay among Kaunas, Trakai and Vilnius.

The marriage of Grand Duke Jogaila and the Queen of Poland Jadwiga began the personal union of Lithuania and Poland. After the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 and by the Treaty of Melno in 1422 the attacks of the Teutonic Order ceased. After the Second Peace of Thorn, the Order was not any more a serious competitor in the region.

Castles built of stones and bricks, dates of the first complete building after wooden precursors:

Almost all Lithuanian medieval castles and fortifications were built of wood and earth.

The oldest church in Lithuania, built from bricks, is the Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos, Vilnius. It was constructed in 1346, when the Renaissance style had not yet arrived in central Europe, and in the Grand Duchy only the Slavic population was Christian.[citation needed] The roofs and design of the outer walls underwent some changes during the course of centuries. Today, the outer appearance is Neo-Byzantine, and most of the walls are plastered.[3]

After Jogaila had been baptized a Catholic, the country officially became Catholic, and churches were built also for the Grand Duchy's Lithuanian population. Soon the most important churches were erected in Brick Gothic:

In the late Gothic period, two exceptional buildings were built in Lithuania, following the abundant French Flamboyant style, but realized in bricks.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture_in_Lithuania
Lithuanian litas,"The Lithuanian litas (ISO currency code LTL, symbolized as Lt; plural litai (nominative) or litų (genitive) was the currency of Lithuania, until 1 January 2015, when it was replaced by the euro. It was divided into 100 centų (genitive case; singular centas, nominative plural centai). The litas was first introduced on 2 October 1922 after World War I, when Lithuania declared independence, and was reintroduced on 25 June 1993 following a period of currency exchange from the Soviet ruble to the litas with the temporary talonas then in place.[1] The name was modeled after the name of the country (similar to Latvia and its lats). From 1994 to 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1. The litas was pegged to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1 since 2002. The euro was expected to replace the litas by 1 January 2007, but persistent high inflation and the economic crisis delayed the switch.

On 1 January 2015, the litas was switched to the euro at the rate of LTL 3.4528 to 1.[2] Nevertheless, coins and banknotes of the second litas will be exchanged indefinitely into euros by the Bank of Lithuania.[3]

The first litas was introduced on 2 October 1922, replacing the ostmark and ostrubel, both of which had been issued by the occupying German forces during World War I. The ostmark was known as the auksinas in Lithuania.

The litas was established at a value of 10 litų = 1 US dollar and was subdivided into 100-centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the litas appeared to be quite a strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the Lithuanian economy. One litas was covered by 0.150462 grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 litas, backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities.[4] It was required that at least one third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai,[5] rising to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.[6]

In March 1939 Nazi Germany demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaipėda Region (also known as the Memel Territory), which had been detached from Germany after World War I. The Lithuanian government complied, and on 23 March 1939 the area was annexed by Germany.
On the same day the reichsmark replaced the litas as the official currency of the region, with 1 litas being exchanged for 40 pfennig. Until 20 May 1939 inhabitants of the Memelgebiet could exchange litas for reichsmarks.[7]

The litas was replaced by the Soviet ruble in April 1941 after Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union, with 1 litas equal to 0.9 ruble, although the actual value of the litas was about 3 to 5 rubles. Such an exchange rate provided great profit for Soviet military and party officials. Trying to protect the value of the currency, people started to massively buy, which, together with a downfall in production (following nationalization), caused material shortages. Withdrawals were then limited to 250 litų[8] before the litas was completely abolished. In 1941 circulation of litas was completely prohibited.[9]

Coins were introduced in 1925 in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centai, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2, 5-litai, with the litas coins in silver. 10 litų coins were introduced in 1936. All these coins were designed by the sculptor Juozas Zikaras (1881–1944). The litas coins displayed Jonas Basanavičius and Vytautas the Great, which was replaced by a portrait of President Antanas Smetona.

In 1922, the Bank of Lithuania issued notes in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centu, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2 litu, 5 litai, 10, 50, 100 litų. In 1924, 500 and 1000 litų notes were added. Denominations below 5 litai were replaced by coins in 1925.

The litas became Lithuania's currency once more on 25 June 1993, when it replaced the temporary talonas currency at a rate of 1 litas to 100 talonas.

In 1993, banknotes (dated 1991) were issued in denominations of 1 litas, 2, 5 litai, 10, 20, 50, 100 litų. Due to poor designs, these were found to be easily copied and a second series of notes was swiftly introduced in denominations of 1 litas, 2, 5 litai, 10, 20, 50 litų, with only the 100 litų notes of the first series remaining in circulation. 200 litų notes were introduced in 1997, followed by 500 litų in 2000.

In 1993, coins were introduced (dated 1991) in denominations of 1 centas, 2, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2, 5 litai. The 1 centas, 2, 5 centai pieces were minted in aluminium, the 10, 20, 50-centų in bronze and the litas coins were of cupro-nickel. In 1997, nickel-brass 10, 20, 50-centų coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 1 litas, bimetallic 2 and 5 litai in 1998. All had the obverse designs showing the coat of arms in the center and the name of the state ""Lietuva"" in capital letters.

The first coins were minted in the United Kingdom and arrived in Lithuania on 31 October 1990. Later, all coins were minted in the state run ""Lithuanian Mint"", which started its operations in September 1992 and helped to cut the costs of introducing the litas.

Officials started to prepare for the introduction of the litas even before independence was declared, it was thought to introduce the litas alongside the ruble even if Lithuania remained a part of the Soviet Union.[10] In December 1989, artists were asked to submit sketches of possible coin and banknote designs. Also, a list of famous people was compiled in order to determine who should be featured for its currency.

The Bank of Lithuania was established on 1 March 1990. Ten days later, Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union. At first, the Lithuanian government negotiated in vain with François Charles Oberthur, a printing company located in France to print the banknotes. In November 1990, the Bank of Lithuania decided to work with the United States Banknote Corporation (now American Banknote Corporation). In late autumn 1991, the first shipments of litas banknotes and coins arrived in Lithuania.

In November 1991, the Currency Issue Law was passed and the Litas Committee was created. It had the power to fix the date for the litas to come into circulation, the terms for the withdrawal from circulation of the ruble, the exchange rate of the litas and other conditions. Officials waited for a while for the economy to stabilise so as not to expose the young litas to inflation. About 80% of Lithuania's trade was with Russia and the government needed to find a way to smooth the transition away from the ruble zone. Also Lithuania needed to gather funds to form a stabilisation fund.

At first, Lithuania did not have gold or any other securities to back up the litas. Lithuania needed to find about 200 million U.S. dollars to form the stabilisation fund. First, it sought to recover its pre-war gold reserves (about 10 tonnes) from France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, etc. In the interwar period Lithuania stored its gold reserves in foreign banks. After the occupation in 1940 those reserves were deemed ""nobody's"": there was no Lithuania and most Western countries condemned the occupation as illegal and did not recognise the Soviet Union as a successor. The Bank of England, for example, sold the reserves to the Soviets in 1967. However, in January 1992 it announced that this action was a ""betrayal of the people of the Baltic states"" and that it would return the originally deposited amount of gold, now worth about 90 million pounds sterling, to the three Baltic states. Lithuania received 18.5 million pounds or 95,000 ounces of gold and remained a customer of the bank. Similarly, in March 1992 Lithuania reclaimed gold from the Bank of France and later from the Bank of Sweden.

In October 1992, the International Monetary Fund (Lithuania joined this organisation on 29 April 1992) granted the first loan of 23.05 million U.S. dollars[11] to create the stabilisation fund. However, it is estimated that at the time of the introduction of the new currency, Lithuania gathered only $120 million for the stabilisation fund. For a brief while it was kept a secret so as not to further damage the reputation and trust in the litas.

Lietuvos Rytas journalists investigated the production of the litas and found that for a while it was purposely held back. For example, 6 million litas designated to pay for printing the banknotes stayed in a zero interest bearing account for a year in a bank in Sweden. By 1992, the litas was ready for introduction, but the banknotes were of extremely low quality, they could easily be counterfeited with a simple colour printer; especially the 10, 20, and 50 litų banknotes.

Newly elected President Algirdas Brazauskas dismissed the Chair of the Bank of Lithuania, Vilius Baldišis, for incompetence just two months before the introduction of the litas. Baldišis was later charged for negligence that cost Lithuania $3,000,000. Some claim that the Russian secret services were behind the affair. Baldišis' explanation was that he was trying to cut the costs of printing the banknotes and thus did not order better security features. Also, ""U.S. Banknote Corporation"" was accused of violation of the contract terms.[citation needed]

But when the new issue of litas banknotes was redesigned, reprinted, and introduced in June 1993, it was found that the quality of the money was still too low and the banknotes would have to be redesigned further in the future. All these scandals and the small backup of gold reserve (about $120 million instead of $200 million) damaged the reputation of the litas. The newly appointed chair, Romualdas Visokavičius, moved things quickly and won the trust of the public. However, in October he was asked to resign mostly because of his involvement with a private bank ""Litimpex"".

On 25 June 1993, the litas was finally introduced at the rate of 1 litas to 100 talonas. 1 U.S. dollar was worth 4.5 litai and decreased to about 4.2 a couple of weeks later. Even the introduction of the litas was followed by a scandal. The government allowed the changing of unlimited amounts of talonas to the litas without having to show the source of the talonas. This allowed criminal groups to legalize their funds.

In July, circulation of the talonas was stopped and on 1 August 1993, the litas became the only legal tender. Following the reintroduction of the litas, there was an effort to weed out U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by the people and the ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very ""dollarised"" as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.

Due to poor banknote quality (both talonas and early litas) it was easy to counterfeit them. Most shops were forced to acquire ultraviolet lamps to check for forgeries. One group, for example, printed 500 talonas banknotes in Turkey. It is estimated that their notes totaled 140,000 litas.[12]

From 1 April 1994 to 1 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1 (the litas was stable around 3.9 for half a year before the rate was fixed). The main reasons for this fixation was little trust in the emerging monetary system, fear of high fluctuations in currency exchange rates, desire to attract foreign investors, and International Monetary Fund recommendations. The peg was renewable every year. For a while a peg was considered to a basket of currencies: the European Currency Unit. At around this time Lithuania also established a currency board.

Alter successful round of negotiations in 1998 with the European Commission, the idea of aligning with the future currency of European Union. By 1999, the Bank of Lithuania proposed currency board with both US dollar and the euro.

The pegging of the litas and the euro was proposed to be implemented by the second half of 2001.[13]

On 2 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.4528 to 1 (1 LTL = 0.28962 EUR) (it was the rate that the litas and the euro had by the time); this rate was not expected to change – and indeed did not – until the litas was completely replaced by the euro on 1 January 2015.[14] After the peg, Lithuania became a member of the Eurozone de facto. The litas became part of the ERM II on 28 June 2004.[15] the EU's exchange rate mechanism. The design of Lithuanian euro coins had already been prepared.

Lithuania postponed its euro day several times, since the country did not meet the convergence criteria. High inflation—which reached 11% in October 2008, well above the then acceptable limit of 4.2%[16]—contributed to Lithuania's failure to meet the criteria. In 2011, polls showed narrow opposition to the currency.[17] On 23 July 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a decision allowing Lithuania to adopt the euro as its currency on 1 January 2015.[14] Litas and euro were both legal tender in Lithuania until 16 January 2015.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_litas
Kęstutis,"Kęstutis (Latin: Kinstut, Lithuanian pronunciation: [kæːsˈtutɪs]; c. 1297 – 3 or 15 August 1382) was sole Duke of Trakai[1] from 1342 to 1382 and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1342 to 1382, together with his brother Algirdas (until 1377), and with his nephew Jogaila (from 1377 to 1381).[2]

The name ""Kęstutis"" is a derivative from the old form of the name Kęstas, which is a shortened version of such Lithuanian names as Kęstaras, Kęstautas (there kęs-ti means to cope).[citation needed] Historic writing sources reflect different Lithuanian pronunciation.[3]

Kęstutis was the son of the Grand Duke Gediminas. His younger brother, Jaunutis, succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Together with his brother Algirdas, Kestutis conspired to remove Jaunutis from power. They were successful in their efforts. They divided their holdings into an eastern and western sphere of influence. The Duchy of Trakai was established in 1337 as a result. Kęstutis's efforts were concentrated in the west, while Algirdas' were concentrated in the eastern part of these territories. Kęstutis organized the defence of western Lithuania and Samogitia against the Teutonic Knights, and organized raids against the German Order. During Kęstutis's rule Teutonic raids into Lithuania reached the peak.[citation needed]

Kęstutis employed different military as well as diplomatic means in his struggle on the western borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1349, to avoid further clashes with the Teutonic Order, he started negotiations with Pope Clement VI for the Christianization of Lithuania, receiving promises for royal crowns for him and his sons. Algirdas willingly remained aside of the business and was concerned with the order in the Ruthenian part of the state. The intermediary in the negotiations, Polish King Casimir III, made an unexpected assault on Volhynia and Brest in October 1349 that ruined Kęstutis's plan. During the Polish-Lithuanian war for Volhynia, King Louis I of Hungary made a peace agreement with Kęstutis on 15 August 1351, according to which Kęstutis obliged himself to accept Christianity and provide the Kingdom of Hungary with military aid, in exchange for the royal crown. The agreement was approved with a pagan ritual by Kęstutis to convince the other side. In fact, Kęstutis had no intentions to comply with the agreement and ran away on their road to Buda.[4]

In March 1361, Kęstutis along with his son Patrikas and his brother Algirdas destroyed and took over the Teutonic Eckersberg and Johannisburg castles. A small squad of Teutonic knights which was returning from the failed , attacked the camp of Kęstutis and Algirdas near the Ublik (Wobel) lake. After a skirmish Kęstutis, who was captured by the crusaders, was detained in Malbork Castle. Kęstutis, being over 60 years old at the time, was only defeated by a third experienced knight who attacked him. Negotiations regarding Kęstutis's liberation were arranged two times but without results. The ransom, which the crusaders asked for Kęstutis, was most likely too high. Kęstutis managed to escape from captivity about half a year later. He, with the help of his servant Alfas, broke a hole in a three meter-thick wall and left the castle by horses dressed up as Teutonic knights. The escape was well planned and it is assumed that Algirdas and Birutė, Kęstutis's wife, greatly contributed to the planned escape.[5]

Algirdas died in 1377 and left the throne to Jogaila, his eldest son from the second marriage with Uliana of Tver. Kęstutis and Vytautas continued to recognize Jogaila's authority even when his right of inheritance was challenged by Andrei of Polotsk, Algirdas' eldest son from the first marriage with Maria of Vitebsk.[6] The Teutonic Knights continued their crusade against pagan Lithuania and both Jogaila and Kęstutis looked for opportunities to establish a truce. On September 29, 1379, a ten-year truce was signed in Trakai.[7] It was the last treaty that Kęstutis and Jogaila signed jointly.[7] In February 1380, Jogaila, without Kęstutis, made a five-month truce with the Livonian Order to protect his Lithuanian domains and Polotsk.[6]

On 31 May 1380, Jogaila and Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės. Based on the terms of the accord, Jogaila agreed not to intervene during attacks by the Teutonic Knights against Kęstutis or his children. However, if providing aid to Kęstutis would be necessary to help to avoid any suspicions, it would not be a violation of the treaty.[8] The motives behind the treaty are not entirely clear. Some historians[who?] blamed Uliana, mother of Jogaila, or his adviser Vaidila,[9] while others[who?] pointed out generational differences: Kęstutis was about 80 years old and determined not to accept Christianity while Jogaila was about 30 years old and was looking for ways to convert and modernize the country.[10] Still others[who?] suggested that the treaty was primarily directed against Andrei and his allies – brother Dmitry of Bryansk and Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitri Donskoi.[11] Jogaila, having secured his western front, allied himself with the Golden Horde against the Grand Duchy of Moscow for the upcoming Battle of Kulikovo.[6]

Without violating the Treaty of Dovydiškės, the Teutonic Knights raided the Duchy of Trakai and Samogitia twice.[6] In August 1381, Komtur of Osterode informed Kęstutis about the secret treaty.[11] In the same month Kęstutis took advantage of Polotsk's rebellion against Skirgaila. Jogaila was away to subdue the rebellion and his absence provided a good opportunity to capture Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy.[9] Kęstutis became the Grand Duke while Jogaila was taken prisoner on his way back to Vilnius.[9][10] Jogaila pledged his loyalty to Kęstutis and was released. He received his patrimony, Kreva and Vitebsk.[6] Kęstutis resumed war with the Teutonic Knights: his army raided Warmia and attempted to capture Georgenburg (Jurbarkas).[7]

On 12 June 1382, while Kęstutis was away to fight Dymitr Korybut of Novhorod-Siversky and Vytautas was away in Trakai,[12] residents of Vilnius, led by merchant Hanul of Riga, let Jogaila's army into the city.[6] The merchants were dissatisfied with Kęstutis's policies as they were hurting the economy, especially trade with Livonia.[6] Jogaila recaptured the throne and allied with the Teutonic Knights.[7] In the meantime Kęstutis rallied his supporters in Samogitia, his son Vytautas sought soldiers in Hrodna, and his brother Liubartas recruited in Galicia–Volhynia.[11] In August 1382 the armies of Kęstutis and Jogaila met near Trakai for a decisive battle, but it never began.[6] Both sides agreed to negotiate. Kęstutis and Vytautas arrived to Jogaila's camp, but were arrested and sent to a prison in the Kreva Castle.[9] Their army was disbanded. On 15 August, five days after imprisonment, Kęstutis was found dead by Skirgaila.[10] Jogaila claimed that he hanged himself, but few believed him.[12] Jogaila organized a large pagan funeral to Kęstutis: his body was burned with horses, weapons, and other treasures in Vilnius,[12] presumably in Šventaragis' Valley. Vytautas managed to escape and continued to fight Jogaila to become Grand Duke in 1392.

Kęstutis is a popular male name in Lithuania. Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis wrote a symphonic overture Kęstutis in 1902. Petras Tarasenka, Lithuanian historian and archeologist, wrote a short story Pabėgimas (The Escape) in 1957, depicting Kęstutis's escape from the Teutonic Order captivity in Marienburg Castle. The monument to Kęstutis was erected in Prienai in 1937, and was then restored in 1990. The ""Grand Duke Kęstutis Motorized Infantry Battalion"" of the Lithuanian Land Force was named after Kęstutis. Military district of Lithuanian partisans was named in honor of Kęstutis — Kęstutis military district.[citation needed]

The Millennium of Russia monument has a sculpture for Kęstutis.

Kęstutis is featured in the 2021 video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Dawn of the Dukes in a campaign detailing the exploits of himself and his brother Algirdas.[13]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kęstutis
Germany–Lithuania relations,"Germany–Lithuania relations are the bilateral relations between Germany and Lithuania. The formal diplomatic relations existed from 1918 to 1944 and again since 1991. Both countries are members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), OECD, the Council of Europe, NATO and the European Union. Lithuania has also been part of the Eurozone since 2015. The relationship is described as close and reliable partnership.[1] Germany gave full support to Lithuania's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.

The name Lithuania (as Litua) first appears in written sources in 1009 in the Quedlinburg Annals in connection with the monk Bruno of Querfurt, who wanted to convert the local people to Christianity. Western powers considered the Baltic Lithuanians as the last stronghold of European paganism, potential missionary territory of the Church and expansion territory of the Livonian and Teutonic knightly nobility. However, the Lithuanians were able to successfully assert themselves against the Lithuanian Crusade, launched by the Teutonic Order in 1283. This self-assertion of the Lithuanians, who formed a powerful medieval state, is an important reason for the different development of the German settlements in Lithuania compared to the Baltic Germans in Estonia and Latvia: while the Baltic Germans immigrated in the course of the conquests of the Teutonic Order in the 13th and 14th centuries and formed a leading class, the Lithuanian Germans came to the country only later and formed an often rather peasant ethnic minority group.[2]

Lithuania became an ally of Poland in the Polish–Teutonic War of 1326–1332. Constant threat from the Teutonic Knights, eventually led the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to establish a personal union with the Kingdom of Poland in 1385, and accept Christianity from Poland. Despite the Christianization of Lithuania, the Teutonic Knights occupied its western region of Samogitia in 1398. In the Battle of Grunwald (1410), the combined Polish–Lithuanian army defeated the Teutonic Order, which established Poland–Lithuania as a major power in Central Europe and started the decline of the Teutonic Order.[3] Samogitia was restored to Lithuania.

The union with Poland was consolidated with the Union of Lublin in 1569. Therefore, until the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, there was a largely common history also in the relations with the German states. In the Peace of Oliva, Poland–Lithuania had to cede, among other things, the Duchy of Prussia, with a sizeable Lithuanian population, living in its Lithuania Minor region, to Brandenburg, which from the 18th century formed part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia prohibited Samogitians, Poles and Jews from settling in Lithuania Minor, and initiated German colonization to change the region's ethnic composition.[4]

The continuing internal and external decline of the state led to Lithuania (and Poland) disappearing from the map in 1795 after several partitions - undertaken by Prussia along with Russia and Austria - with the bulk of Lithuania being annexed by the Russian Empire, and small portions by Prussia and Austria, which after 1815 also passed to Russia. In the 19th century, despite several uprisings against the Russian regime, Lithuanian culture was increasingly threatened by Russification. Cultural contact with Lithuania Minor in the province of East Prussia helped preserve the Lithuanian culture, as the Lithuanian book smugglers supplied Lithuanian books printed in Latin script (which were forbidden in the Tsarist Empire at that time) across the Prussian-Russian border at great risk. At the same time the population of Lithuania Minor was subjected to Germanisation policies.

During World War I, the German Empire, as an adversary of Russia, occupied Lithuania and some neighbouring territories in 1915 and combined them into the administrative unit of Ober Ost. Towards the end of the war, Germany wanted to recognize Lithuania as a sovereign state only if it entered into economic and military union with the Reich. On 11 December 1917, the Council of Lithuania declared the restoration of the ""independent"" state of Lithuania with Vilnius as its capital and with ties to the German Empire. Since Germany delayed the recognition, on 16 February 1918, the Council again proclaimed Lithuania's independence without any ties to the other states, thus forming the Republic of Lithuania. Subsequently, Lithuanians were able to defend their state during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. In 1923 Lithuania annexed the Klaipėda Region, i.e. a portion of historic Lithuania Minor in East Prussia north of the Neman River, formerly part of the German Empire, with the port city of Memel (today Klaipėda), which had been administered by the League of Nations since the end of the War. In 1924, this annexation was recognized by the previous protecting powers. Apart from the problem of the Klaipėda Region, German–Lithuanian relations in the interwar period developed quite positively to some extent, the two states being bound together by their dislike of Poland, to which both had territorial claims.[5]

After the Nazi takeover in March 1933, tensions began to rise again, reaching a climax with the Trial of Neumann and Sass in 1934, when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of German pro-Nazi activists. Following the 1939 German ultimatum, Lithuania had to cede the Klaipėda Region back to Germany. In the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Lithuania had initially been assigned to the German sphere of influence. After the outbreak of World War II, however, there was a revision of this treaty by the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty with a change in the spheres of influence. Germany received parts of central Poland, while Lithuania was awarded to the Soviet Union. On 15 June 1940, the Red Army invaded and occupied Lithuania. As late as 1941, many Lithuanian Germans were resettled in the German sphere of influence. After the Operation Barbarossa, from 1941 to 1945, Lithuania was entirely occupied by the Wehrmacht and belonged to the Reichskommissariat Ostland. During this period, Germans and Lithuanian collaborators committed crimes against humanity against opposition members and minorities, chiefly Jews and Poles. Lithuanian Jews fell victim to the Holocaust, and 95% of them didn't survive the war. Germany operated the Kauen concentration camp and various Nazi prisons, forced labour camps and prisoner-of-war camps for Allied POWs in occupied Lithuania. In Lithuania, attempts were made to implement the so-called Kegelbahn project, i.e. the targeted settlement of certain conquered territories with German resettlers. From 1944 on, most of the Germans fled from the reapproaching Red Army or were expelled soon after. Thousands of Lithuanians fled with the Germans to the West. For the exiled Lithuanians who settled in West Germany, the Lithuanian grammar school in Hüttenfeld in southern Hesse formed a cultural preservation center. Expelled Lithuanian-Germans united in 1951 in the Landsmannschaft der Deutschen aus Litauen (Association of Germans from Lithuania).[5]

Lithuania, alike East Germany, fell to the Soviets, although it has regained its main port city of Klaipėda. German–Lithuanian contacts were only possible to a very limited extent during the Cold War.

Lithuania restored its independence on 11 March 1990. In the early 1990s, Germany opposed Lithuanian independence from the Soviet Union, with Chancellor Helmut Kohl stating that Lithuania should wait 10 more years before declaring independence.[6] In 1991, Germany's protest following the January Events, in which the Soviet military attacked unarmed Lithuanian civilians, were reserved.[6] Germany recognized the independence of Lithuania and the other two Baltic States on 27 August 1991. In the following period, Germany's policy towards Lithuania oscillated between the willingness and obligation to integrate the Baltic States into the European structures and the fear of thereby angering Russia or disrupting its rapprochement with Europe.[7] At times, Germany was even considered the main opposing voice among the Western powers with regard to NATO accession.[8]

In 2004, Lithuania joined NATO and the European Union. This marked a new relationship between Germany and Lithuania, especially within the European structures.

Following the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence was established in the Baltic States, with Germany assuming the responsibility to lead the multinational battle group in Lithuania.[9] The security situation in Europe further deteriorated after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Baltic States requested their NATO allies to increase the military presence in the region.[10] In 2023, the military cooperation between the states reached a new level when Germany agreed to deploy the 45th Panzer Brigade of Bundeswehr in Lithuania on a permanent basis.[11]

For Lithuania, Germany is an important trade and investment partner. According to the United Nations Comtrade database on international trade, in 2022, Lithuania exported goods to Germany for over 3.6 billion euros, while Germany exported goods to Lithuania for over 5.5 billion euros. Both countries trade mainly industrial goods.[12]

In 2021, over 54,000 Lithuanian citizens lived in Germany, making Germany one of the most important destination for Lithuanian immigrants within the EU.[13] Historically, a large Baltic German minority lived in Lithuania, most of which was expelled after the Soviet occupation. According to the 2021 census, just under 2000 Germans still lived in Lithuania.[14]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany–Lithuania_relations

Polish–Lithuanian occupation of Moscow,"The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth occupation of Moscow took place between 1610 and 1612 during the Polish intervention in Russia, when the Kremlin was occupied by the Polish garrison with additional Lithuanian units under the command of hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski and assisted by Russian boyars led by Mikhail Saltykov. The occupation coincided with Russia's Time of Troubles.

From March 1611 to the autumn of 1612, the Cossacks of Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy besieged Moscow and the Polish-Lithuanian forces there. The city was finally liberated by the Second People's Militia, and the date of the capture of Kitay-Gorod is celebrated in modern Russia as the Day of National Unity[1] on November 4, alongside festivities in honour of Our Lady of Kazan.

In October–November 1610, after tsarist troops were defeated at Klushino and the Seven Boyars agreed to elevate Polish prince Władysław IV Vasa to the Russian throne so as to maintain order in the capital until the arrival of a new head of state, the Commonwealth troops of Stanisław Żółkiewski entered Moscow without a fight. Żółkiewski camped on the Khoroshyovsky Meadows and Khodynka Field. Although he personally opposed the occupation of the Russian capital, he entered the city under the pressure of Polish king Sigismund III.

At the end of 1610, about 6,000 armored and cavalry soldiers, 800 infantrymen, and 400 hajduks were stationed at Moscow and Novodevichy Convent, led by Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski, Marcin Kazanowski, Aleksander Zborowski and Ludwik Wejher. For every soldier, there were three civilians who had joined them on the way to Moscow acting as servants, sutlers and prostitutes.[2]

Żółkiewski placed the soldiers in Moscow so that in the event of an attack they could come to each other's aid or retreat to the Kremlin. A significant part of the garrison was located west of the Kremlin wall near the Neglinnaya River. To maintain order, a tribunal was established in which the Russian side was represented by Grigory Romodanovsky and Ivan Streshnev, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth side by Aleksander Koryciński and a Lieutenant (Porucznik) Maliński.[2]

When Żółkiewski went to Smolensk in November for a meeting with Sigismund III, he took his regiments with him. Several units were left at the Novodevichy Convent to control the roads to Mozhaysk and Volokolamsk. The rest were staged closer to the besieged Smolensk, in Vereya and Mozhaysk.

In March 1611, in connection with the formation of the First People's Militia, the commander of the Polish-Lithuanian garrison, Aleksander Gosiewski, engaged in several street battles during which most of Moscow was burned. Having broken the townspeople's resistance in advance, Gosiewski hoped to minimize support for the First Militia.

In April and early May of that year, the militias stormed the ramparts of Zemlyanoy City and the walls of the White City, liberating most of the territory of Moscow, after which they locked the invaders behind the Kitay-Gorod and Kremlin Walls. The Cossacks of Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy laid siege to the Kremlin garrison itself, which was manned by Poles. Also inside the walls were members of the Semiboyarshchina, including the future Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov and his mother.[3]

Provisions for the garrison were collected in the Moscow region by the regiment of Jan Piotr Sapieha. According to the testimony of the memoirist Samuel Maskiewicz, ""what anyone liked, and whether the greatest boyar's wife or daughter, they took them by force.""[4] After the death of Sapieha in September 1611, Lithuanian commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz took over the difficult task of collecting food.

At the end of 1611, carts with provisions collected by Samuel Korecki reached the Kremlin. In January 1612, a regiment was able to break through to Moscow, which temporarily eased the food situation. However, the Hungarian infantrymen of Felix Nevyarovsky did not bring their provisions, and their presence only accelerated the return food scarcity.

The entire first half of 1612 was unusually cold, and many of the garrison's soldiers formed a confederation and abandoned the Russian capital. Famine began in the city; speculators sold bread at 30 times its regular price.

Russian historian Avraamy Palitsyn claims that after they entered into the Kremlin, Dmitry Troubetskoy's Cossacks discovered salted human flesh, ""and under the slings, there is a lot of human corpse,"" suggesting that the garrison resorted to cannibalism when food supplies ran out.[5]

Throughout 1612, Polish-Lithuanian formations began to leave Moscow. Commander Gosiewski left in June, along with the veterans of the Klushino Battle and the remnants of the Kremlin's treasury.[6] Mikołaj Struś commanded what remained of the garrison. The garrison itself was almost resupplied during the Battle of Moscow in September, but forces with some 400 carts of provisions were forced to retreat after getting within two kilometers of the Kremlin.

Trubetskoy's Cossacks established control of Kitay-Gorod at the beginning of November,[7] after which Struś opened negotiations on terms of surrender. The Kremlin garrison formally capitulated on November 7. Although Trubetskoy promised to ""leave the defeated in health and have respect,"" they were massacred instead: ""The Cossacks beat the whole regiment, leaving a few.""[8]

Before the Truce of Deulino was signed in 1619, which ended the Russian-Polish War and fostered an exchange of prisoners, the Poles and Lithuanians captured in the Kremlin were settled in Yaroslavl, Balakhna, Nizhny Novgorod and other Upper Volga cities. In Nizhny Novgorod, the mother of Prince Pozharsky put in her word for the prisoners, so they only were thrown ""in a dungeon very dark, poor and stinking, in which they had been sitting for nineteen weeks"".[9] The prisoners held in Galich and along the river Unzha were completely exterminated.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Lithuanian_occupation_of_Moscow

Antanas Smetona,"Antanas Smetona (Lithuanian: [ɐnˈtǎːnɐs sʲmʲɛtoːˈnɐ] ⓘ; 10 August 1874 – 9 January 1944) was a Lithuanian intellectual, journalist and politician. He served as the first president of Lithuania from 1919 to 1920 and later as the authoritarian head of state from 1926 until the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940. Referred to as the ""Leader of the Nation"" during his presidency,[1] Smetona is recognised as one of the most important Lithuanian political figures between World War I and World War II, and a prominent ideologist of Lithuanian nationalism and the movement for national revival.[2]

Born into a farming family in the village of Užulėnis, Kovno Governorate, Smetona exhibited a strong interest in education and Lithuanian cultural identity from an early age. He attended Palanga Progymnasium and later graduated from Jelgava Gymnasium. He pursued higher education at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, where he studied law and became involved in nationalist and cultural movements. During this time, he contributed to the Lithuanian press, advocating for national self-determination and the preservation of Lithuanian culture under Russian imperial rule. After completing his studies, he worked as a teacher and journalist, eventually becoming one of the key intellectual leaders of the Lithuanian National Revival.

The Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent collapse of the Russian Empire provided a pivotal opportunity for Smetona and other Lithuanian leaders to pursue national independence. As a member of the Council of Lithuania, he was instrumental in the drafting and signing of the Act of Independence on 16 February 1918, which proclaimed the restoration of an independent Lithuania. During the interwar period, Smetona emerged as a prominent political figure, serving as the first President and later taking power in a coup d'état in 1926. Under his leadership, Lithuania pursued a policy of neutrality and underwent significant economic and cultural development, despite the challenges posed by regional instability and the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe.

After the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in 1940, Smetona fled to Germany and later to the United States, where he lived in exile until his death in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1944. His legacy remains a topic of debate among historians. While some view him as a pivotal figure in the establishment of Lithuanian independence and the promotion of national identity, others criticize his authoritarian rule and suppression of political opposition.

Smetona was born on 10 August [O.S. 28 July] 1874 in the village of Užulėnis, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire, to a family of farmers, Jonas Smetona and Julijona Kartanaitė – former serfs of the Taujėnai Manor, which belonged to the Radziwiłł family.[1][2] Researcher Kazimieras Gasparavičius has traced Smetona's patrilineal ancestry to Laurentijus who was born around 1695 and lived near Raguva.[3] Smetona was the eighth of nine children.[4] His parents were hardworking people who managed to double their inherited 5 hectares (12 acres).[5] His father was literate and Smetona learned to read at home.[6]

Smetona's father died in 1885 when Smetona was only 11 years old and, despite financial difficulties, a year later Smetona – the only of his siblings – was sent to the primary school in Taujėnai where instruction was in Russian due to the Lithuanian press ban.[7] This was his dying father's request.[8] His mother hoped that Smetona would become a priest.[9] After graduation in 1889, Smetona wanted to continue his education, but gymnasiums admitted pupils only up to the age of 12 and he was already 15 years old. Therefore, he was forced to study privately in Ukmergė in order to catch up and be able to pass examinations to enter the fourth class of gymnasium.[10] In summer 1891, he attempted to gain admission to the Liepāja Gymnasium as his brother Motiejus worked in a factory in Liepāja.[11] He was refused and instead applied to the Palanga Progymnasium, which had no age restrictions.[12] Smetona was an exemplary student (one of the top two students) and received a tuition waiver. As a superintendent of a student dormitory, he also received free housing and was able to support himself by providing private lessons.[13] Three other future signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania attended the progymnasium at the same time: Steponas Kairys, Jurgis Šaulys, and Kazimieras Steponas Šaulys.[14] As Palanga was close to East Prussia, it was easier to obtain Lithuanian literature, which was banned by the Tsarist authorities. Smetona began reading Lithuanian periodicals and books, including a history of Lithuania by Maironis.[15]

After graduating in 1893, according to his family's wishes, he passed his entrance examinations for the Samogitian Diocesan Seminary in Kaunas.[16] However, he felt no great calling for priesthood and enrolled at the Jelgava Gymnasium in Latvia. This was a cultural hub of the Lithuanian National Revival and attracted many future leaders in Lithuanian culture and politics, including Juozas Tūbelis and Vladas Mironas who later became Smetona's political companions.[16] In particular, Lithuanian language and culture was openly promoted by the linguist, Jonas Jablonskis, teacher of Greek, with whom Smetona developed a close professional relationship.[17] Jablonskis visited Smetona's native village collecting data on Lithuanian dialects.[18] Smetona met his future wife, Sofija Chodakauskaitė, through Jablonskis who recommended him as tutor for her brother.[19]

In autumn 1896, the administration of the Jelgava Gymnasium forced Lithuanian students to recite their prayers in Russian while Latvian and German students were allowed to use their native languages.[20] Smetona and other students refused and were expelled. Most later agreed to pray in Russian and were re-admitted, but a handful who refused were prohibited from attending any other school.[21] The students sent petitions to Pope Leo XIII and Ivan Delyanov, Minister of National Education.[22] Smetona and two others, Jurgis Šlapelis [lt] and Petras Vaiciuška, managed to secure an audience with Delyanov, who allowed the Lithuanians to pray in Latin and the expelled students to continue their education.[23] Smetona did not return to Jelgava and finished up at Gymnasium No. 9 in Saint Petersburg.[24]

Upon graduation in 1897, Smetona entered the faculty of law of the University of Saint Petersburg. He was more interested in history and languages, but knew that as a Catholic his choices were limited to priest, lawyer, or doctor if he wanted to work in Lithuania.[24] Saint Petersburg, with a direct railway connection to Lithuania, was becoming a Lithuanian cultural center. Smetona joined and chaired a secret Lithuanian student organization. He was later succeeded by Steponas Kairys.[25] He also joined a Lithuanian choir led by Česlovas Sasnauskas, organist at the Church of St. Catherine.[26] Smetona was exposed to socialist ideas and even read Marx's Capital, but resolutely rejected them.[25] He was expelled from the university, imprisoned for two weeks, and deported to Vilnius for participating in the February 1899 student protests.[24] It was the first time Smetona visited the city, the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and it left a deep impression on him.[24] A month later, he was allowed to return to the university.[27]

In 1898, Smetona and his roommate, Vladas Sirutavičius [lt], using a mimeograph, printed about 100 copies of a brief Lithuanian grammar written by Petras Avižonis based on the German-language writings of Friedrich Kurschat.[27] This grammar was insufficient for Lithuanian needs and in summer 1900 Jonas Jablonskis set to work on his Lithuanian grammar. He was assisted by Avižonis, Žemaitė, and Smetona, though Smetona mostly edited works of Bishop Motiejus Valančius.[19] The grammar was published in 1901 and became a fundamental work in establishing the standard Lithuanian language.[19] In early 1902, the police began investigating a network of Lithuanian book smugglers and raided Smetona's room where they found several prohibited Lithuanian publications. He was imprisoned in Vyborg Castle, but managed to secure acquittal and graduate that spring.[28]

After his graduation from university in 1902, he moved to Vilnius and worked at the Vilnius Land Bank until 1915. He became an active participant in Lithuanian cultural life and, up until becoming president in December 1926, devoted substantial amounts of time and effort to the Lithuanian press.[29] Two years later, he married Sofija Chodakauskaitė in the Church of St. Raphael the Archangel in Vilnius.[30]

From his very first days in Vilnius, Smetona became involved in the activities of various Lithuanian nationalist groups, and joined the Lithuanian Democratic Party, which he represented in the Great Seimas of Vilnius. He was later elected to its Presidium. In 1904 and 1907, he was on the staff of the Lithuanian newspaper, Vilniaus žinios (The Vilnius News). In 1905–1906, he edited the weekly Lietuvos ūkininkas (The Lithuanian Farmer). In 1907, Smetona and the Rev. Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas established a venture to print the newspaper Viltis (The Hope), and started publishing and circulating it. In Viltis, Smetona advocated national unity. He was also one of the incorporators of the Aušra (Dawn) company for the publishing of Lithuanian books, a member of the Lithuanian Mutual Aid Society of Vilnius, the Lithuanian Learned Society, the Vilniaus aušra (The Dawn of Vilnius), and Rytas (The Morning) education societies, the Rūta Art Society and many other societies, and taught the Lithuanian language at Vilnius schools. In 1914, he started publishing Vairas (The Rudder), a new bi-weekly magazine.

During the First World War, he was the first vice-chairman, and later chairman, of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers. In the summer of 1916, Antanas Smetona, together with other Lithuanians from Vilnius, presented a memorandum to the German Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Front, in which they demanded the right of the Lithuanian nation to have an independent State. On 6 September 1917, he started printing the newspaper, Lietuvos Aidas (Lithuania's Echo), working as its publisher and its editor-in-chief. In the first issue of the newspaper, Smetona wrote that the most important goal of the Lithuanian nation was the re-establishment of an independent Lithuanian state.

Between 18 and 22 September 1917, he participated in the Lithuanian Conference in Vilnius, and was elected chairman (1917–1919) of the Council of Lithuania (later Council of the State). On 16 February 1918, Antanas Smetona signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania.

Between December 1918 and March 1919, he lived primarily in Germany and the Scandinavian countries, soliciting loans for the cause of Lithuanian independence. On 4 April 1919, the State Council of Lithuania elected Smetona the first president of the Republic of Lithuania. On 19 April 1920, the Constituent Assembly elected Aleksandras Stulginskis President. Not re-elected to Seimas, from 1921 to 1924, he edited several periodicals, including Lietuvos balsas, Lietuviškas balsas and Vairas.

After the Klaipėda Revolt of January 1923, in the Memelland, which had been separated from Germany, he was made commissioner there on 20 February, but, due to disagreements with Prime Minister Ernestas Galvanauskas, he resigned from his post.

In November 1923, authorities imprisoned Smetona for several days[why?] for publishing an article[which?] by Augustinas Voldemaras in Vairas. Between 1923 and 1927, he was an assistant professor at the University of Lithuania – at first in the chair of art theory and history and later at the department of philosophy. He lectured on ethics, ancient philosophy and Lithuanian linguistics. In 1932, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. at the Vytautas Magnus University.

Smetona participated in the activity of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union that had staged the Klaipėda Revolt, which gave him greater name-recognition. More than once, he was elected to its central board. Between 1924 and 1940, he was the vice-chairman of the board of the International Bank.

Smetona was known for his tolerant stance towards Jews and his radical opponents nicknamed him as ""Jewish King"".[32][33] Under Smetona's rule in Lithuania, not a single anti-Jewish law was passed and high-ranking Lithuanian officials, including ministers, did not publicly say anti-Jewish statements.[33] Smetona considered Jews not as foreigners, but as Lithuanian citizens of foreign nationality and himself acted against antisemitic acts with his statements which were later followed by actions of governmental institutions (e.g. censorship).[33] The Lithuanian courts, war commandants, Lithuanian Police Force severely punished the participants of anti-Jewish physical attacks or smashing of Jews windows (the culprits were punished with fines, imprisoned or even sent to hard labor prisons).[33] Moreover, the Government of Lithuania also did not tolerate anti-Jewish attacks and severely punished their participants, especially activists.[33] Consequently, Jews were widely sympathetic towards Smetona and his rule.[33] However, his regime did not tolerate insults of the German government and actively repressed suspected communists. For example, in 1934, the Ministry of National Defence of Lithuania approved an order to the counties commandants to ""severely punish all those who insult the German Government in any way, as well as those who deliberately agitate against Lithuanian Jews; to suppress the activity of all those Jewish organizations which appear to be under Communist cover or succumb to Communist influence"".[33]

""The Poles stole Lithuanian history, now the Russians are trying to steal it, we have to catch those thieves by the hand and show them in a real light to the entire world.""

Smetona was a leader of the 1926 coup d'état that deposed President Kazys Grinius. He once again became president on 19 December that year (two others briefly held the office during the coup, which began on 17 December, before Smetona was formally restored to the presidency). He designated Augustinas Voldemaras as prime minister. One year later, he dissolved parliament, and on 15 May 1928, with the approval of the government, he promulgated a new constitution with more extensive presidential powers. In 1929, he removed Voldemaras and assumed dictatorial powers. He was re-elected president in 1931 and 1938, both times as the sole candidate. He remained in office until 15 June 1940.

Smetona's constitution vested the president with both executive and legislative powers when the Seimas was not in session. The Seimas was not reconvened until the 1936 Lithuanian parliamentary election; for the next decade, Smetona ruled by decree, without a parliament, which made his regime on paper one of the most arbitrary in the world. Even when the Seimas was reconvened, it was composed entirely of Smetona's adherents; Smetona thus effectively retained all governing power in the nation. In 1938, a third constitution was enacted that retained the general authoritarian character of the 1928 document, and declared that political power in the state was ""indivisible.""

The regime repeatedly arrested and imprisoned members of the already-banned Communist Party – as with almost all interwar European dictatorships, the claimed threat of Communism was the source of its legitimacy and the regime executed the original leadership[who?] five days after coming to power.[35] However, despite propaganda that Communists were a ""non-Lithuanian force invading the country"", they continued to operate underground with growing membership and it is known today that their leaders were ethnically Lithuanian.[36]

In 1935, Smetona suffered a blow when farmers in southeastern Lithuania organised a strike[why?] and refused to sell their products. Reprisals led to five deaths and 456 farmers being arrested, which exacerbated long-standing tensions within his regime between hardliners, who argued for more rigid authoritarian control over Lithuanian life, and moderates, who wanted liberalism.[37] The difficulties, however, were already becoming overshadowed by the threat of Nazi Germany. Smetona's regime was the first in Europe to put Nazis on trial: as early as 8 February 1934, action was taken against Nazis in the Memel region, which was autonomous within Lithuania.[38] The Smetona regime's trial of Ernst Neumann and Freiherr von Sass (July 1934 to March 1935) was the first attempt anywhere to bring Nazis to justice and saw 76 Hitlerites imprisoned and four sentenced to death,[38] but the sentences were was commuted to life imprisonment.[39][40] By 1938, however, Memel was becoming a difficult issue for a regime spending a quarter of its budget on defence and expensive army modernisation,[36] and the Nazis won 26 of 29 seats in elections.

The following year, Smetona surrendered Memel to Hitler and declared a state of emergency;[41] he never lost his distaste for Hitler and Nazism and had been so discredited by the loss of Memel that members of Lithuania's political opposition were appointed to his cabinet[42] to try recovering credibility and domestic stability.

Smetona's government was cautious about industrialisation, as its support base lay in the dominant rural population. As dictator, Smetona did nothing to encourage direct foreign investment, which remained extremely limited throughout his time in office.[43] Nonetheless, during Smetona's dictatorship, Lithuania advanced economically: industrial output, mainly directed to domestic demand, when he was overthrown by the Soviet invasion was twice what it had been before the coup that brought him to power, and the country's transport network had been greatly improved by the construction of railways from Šiauliai to Klaipėda and from Kaunas to the south and north-east. In contrast, Smetona was more generous in support for the agricultural sector, which then provided almost all of Lithuania's exports despite occasionally protests against the regime.[43]

Lithuania was occupied by the Soviets in 1940 as a consequence of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. After the Soviets presented an ultimatum to Lithuania in June that year, Smetona proposed armed resistance against them,[44] but most of the government and army commanders believed that the country was not capable of effective resistance with Soviet troops stationed inside Lithuania.[when?][45] On 15 June, Smetona turned his presidential duties over to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys on an interim basis, according to the constitution. Before leaving the presidential palace, Smetona said: ""I do not want to make Lithuania a bolshevik country with my own hands."" He believed that by leaving the country, he would be in a position to do more for the country by leading a government-in-exile than by becoming a Soviet puppet.[46] He firstly fled to Germany with his family. Shortly afterwards, the Smetonas fled to Switzerland.[47]

A day after Smetona left the country, Merkys announced that he had deposed him and was now president himself. Two days later, Merkys was pressured into appointing the more pliant Justas Paleckis as prime minister and resigning. Paleckis then became acting president, and was used as a puppet to oversee the final stages of Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet Union a month later.

Since Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1990, it has taken the position that Merkys's takeover of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional since Smetona never formally resigned. Lithuania thus does not recognize Merkys or Paleckis as legitimate presidents and contends that all subsequent actions leading up to the Soviet annexation were ipso facto void.[citation needed]

""I do not want to bolshevize Lithuania with my own hands.""

On the morning of 15 June, just after the government decided to accept the Soviet ultimatum, Smetona made hasty preparations to flee the country. He was accompanied by his wife, his son and daughter and their spouses and children, Kazys Musteikis, former minister of defense, and two presidential adjutants. Smetona departed Kaunas at about 3 pm that day.[49] They stopped in Kybartai on the border with Nazi Germany. Smetona and Musteikis attempted to summon the 9th Infantry Regiment from Marijampolė to protect them and to offer at least symbolic resistance to the Red Army, but the regiment was stopped by a delegation sent from Kaunas to retrieve the president.[50] Smetona decided to cross the border without delay, but Lithuanian border guards would not allow him to pass. Around midnight, a local man led Smetona, his bodyguard and adjutant across the shallow Liepona stream.[51] With Smetona already on the other side, his family managed to convince border guards to let them through at about 6 am.[52]

On the German side, Smetona was met by Heinz Gräfe [de], a Gestapo officer. Via Königsberg, the refugees were moved to a hunting lodge near the Święcajty [pl] (Schwenzait) lake in the Masurian Lake District.[53] On 17 August, Smetona received permission to relocate to Berlin, where he settled on the Rankestraße [de]. There, he was carefully supervised and allowed to communicate only with Lithuanian representative, Kazys Škirpa.[54] The Germans did not allow him to make any political moves so as not to upset the Soviet Union. It was clear that Smetona's presence was not desirable.[55] On 4 September, Smetona officially petitioned the Embassy of the United States in Berlin for U.S. visas.[56] The request was granted, but only on condition that while Smetona was in the U.S., he would not be considered the leader or representative of any state or government.[56] It was a humiliating condition, but Smetona accepted it and left for Bern, Switzerland on 18 September.[57] Musteikis stayed in Berlin.[58]

In Bern, Smetona met with members of the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service, ambassadors and diplomats who continued to represent pre-occupation Lithuania. They hoped to establish a government-in-exile via the National Committee chaired by former prime minister Ernestas Galvanauskas. Smetona saw no need for such a committee and criticized the choice of Galvanauskas. The diplomats were not receptive to Smetona – he had no funds, authority or political influence.[59] Nevertheless, Smetona signed the so-called Kybartai Act – a backdated document supposedly written in Kybartai before his exile.[60] The Act dismissed Antanas Merkys and appointed Stasys Lozoraitis as both prime minister and acting president. This controversial document was never used in practice.

Smetona departed Bern for Lisbon in January 1941. He stayed in Monte Estoril at the Pensão Zenith.[61] He left for Brazil aboard the Serpa Pinto, arriving in Rio de Janeiro on 14 February.[57] He was met by local officials and Lithuanian emigrants, and had a meeting with Getúlio Vargas, the president of Brazil.[57] Smetona departed Brazil on 26 February. On 9 or 10 March 1941, Smetona and his wife arrived in New York on the SS Argentina.[57] He was greeted by about 30 American journalists and photographers as well as Lithuanian-American representatives. He was escorted to The Pierre hotel, where an evening function with about 400 guests was held on 13 March.[62] Since Smetona was a private individual in the United States, the gathering did not include any members of U.S. organizations.[63]

They lived temporarily at the Embassy of Lithuania in Washington, D.C., but their relationship with representative Povilas Žadeikis was tense. Smetona then lived in Pittsburgh and Chicago before settling in Cleveland in May 1942 with his son's family. While in exile, he began work on a history of Lithuania and on his memoirs.

As Smetona was busy on his writing, he paid little attention to the fact that the heating system in his son's house needed repair and was becoming dangerous. On 28 October 1943, Smetona wrote:

The night before yesterday coal fumes made me dizzy. I could not think clearly. Now I have completely recovered.[64]

On 9 January 1944, a fire broke out in the house. Smetona's son Julius noticed the fire while on the first floor. Above him, in the attic suite, Smetona and his wife Sofija spotted the smoke seeping in under the door. Sofija opened the door and she and Smetona began descending the stairs. Smetona, apparently decided that he could not go outside without a coat – he was recovering from the flu and was to give a talk in the coming weeks – and without saying anything to his wife, returned to get his fur coat. It took just a few minutes for him to be overcome by the smoke. Julius tried to return into the burning building to save his father but was forced out by the smoke and fire. Smetona was found lying on the kitchen floor on the second floor of Julius' flat. He was not burned.[65]

Firefighters took Smetona outside and he was rushed to hospital by ambulance. He died before arriving.[66]

The official record said that the fire was caused by an overheated furnace. Some believe, however, that due to Smetona's continued political activities, the fire was started by the Russian Intelligence Service (called the NKGB at the time). With no evidence turning up in the subsequent years to substantiate that claim, it is, however, doubtful.[citation needed]

On 13 January, the funeral of President Smetona took place at Cleveland's Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. Bishop Edward F. Hoban officiated. Smetona was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Cleveland.

His wife Sofija died in Cleveland on 28 December 1968.

The couple were survived by their daughter, Marija Danutė Smetonaitė (1905–1992), son Julius Rimgaudas Smetona (1913–1974) and Julius' sons, Anthony Algirdas Smetona (1939–2012), Juozas Smetona (1940–1996) and Vytautas Julius Smetona (born 1955).

In 1975, Smetona's remains were moved from Cleveland's Knollwood Cemetery mausoleum to a crypt (No. 103) next to his wife Sofija in All Souls Cemetery in Chardon, Ohio.[67]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antanas_Smetona
Neminem captivabimus,"Neminem captivabimus is a legal term in  Polish and Lithuanian historical law that was short for neminem captivabimus nisi iure victum (Latin, ""We shall not arrest anyone without a court verdict"").

In the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, it was one of the szlachta's privileges, stating that the king could neither punish nor imprison any member of the szlachta without a viable court verdict. Its purpose was to release someone who had been arrested unlawfully. Neminem captivabimus had nothing to do with whether the prisoner is guilty but only with whether due process had been observed.

It was introduced by King Władysław Jagiełło in the Acts of Jedlnia (1430) and Kraków (1433) and remained in use until the Partitions of Poland (1772–1795). The same acts guaranteed that he would not confiscate any szlachta property without a court verdict.

The Four-Year Sejm (1791) decided that the privilege be granted to inhabitants of royal cities who owned real property there and to the Polish Jews.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neminem_captivabimus

1936 Lithuanian parliamentary election,"Parliamentary elections were held in Lithuania on 10 June 1936,[1] after a new law on holding elections was issued by presidential decree.[2]

Candidates had to be nominated by district or town councils.[1] The number of candidates nominated was equal to the number of seats available, and the number of seats was reduced from 85 to 49.[3][4] All political parties were banned except the Lithuanian Nationalist Union and its allies.[2]

The Nationalist Union won 42 seats, whilst the remaining seven were taken by Young Lithuania, a youth branch of the Nationalist Union.[5] The fourth Seimas first met on 1 September 1936, and drew up a new constitution, which was promulgated on 11 February 1938.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Lithuanian_parliamentary_election
Polish–Lithuanian occupation of Moscow,"The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth occupation of Moscow took place between 1610 and 1612 during the Polish intervention in Russia, when the Kremlin was occupied by the Polish garrison with additional Lithuanian units under the command of hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski and assisted by Russian boyars led by Mikhail Saltykov. The occupation coincided with Russia's Time of Troubles.

From March 1611 to the autumn of 1612, the Cossacks of Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy besieged Moscow and the Polish-Lithuanian forces there. The city was finally liberated by the Second People's Militia, and the date of the capture of Kitay-Gorod is celebrated in modern Russia as the Day of National Unity[1] on November 4, alongside festivities in honour of Our Lady of Kazan.

In October–November 1610, after tsarist troops were defeated at Klushino and the Seven Boyars agreed to elevate Polish prince Władysław IV Vasa to the Russian throne so as to maintain order in the capital until the arrival of a new head of state, the Commonwealth troops of Stanisław Żółkiewski entered Moscow without a fight. Żółkiewski camped on the Khoroshyovsky Meadows and Khodynka Field. Although he personally opposed the occupation of the Russian capital, he entered the city under the pressure of Polish king Sigismund III.

At the end of 1610, about 6,000 armored and cavalry soldiers, 800 infantrymen, and 400 hajduks were stationed at Moscow and Novodevichy Convent, led by Aleksander Korwin Gosiewski, Marcin Kazanowski, Aleksander Zborowski and Ludwik Wejher. For every soldier, there were three civilians who had joined them on the way to Moscow acting as servants, sutlers and prostitutes.[2]

Żółkiewski placed the soldiers in Moscow so that in the event of an attack they could come to each other's aid or retreat to the Kremlin. A significant part of the garrison was located west of the Kremlin wall near the Neglinnaya River. To maintain order, a tribunal was established in which the Russian side was represented by Grigory Romodanovsky and Ivan Streshnev, and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth side by Aleksander Koryciński and a Lieutenant (Porucznik) Maliński.[2]

When Żółkiewski went to Smolensk in November for a meeting with Sigismund III, he took his regiments with him. Several units were left at the Novodevichy Convent to control the roads to Mozhaysk and Volokolamsk. The rest were staged closer to the besieged Smolensk, in Vereya and Mozhaysk.

In March 1611, in connection with the formation of the First People's Militia, the commander of the Polish-Lithuanian garrison, Aleksander Gosiewski, engaged in several street battles during which most of Moscow was burned. Having broken the townspeople's resistance in advance, Gosiewski hoped to minimize support for the First Militia.

In April and early May of that year, the militias stormed the ramparts of Zemlyanoy City and the walls of the White City, liberating most of the territory of Moscow, after which they locked the invaders behind the Kitay-Gorod and Kremlin Walls. The Cossacks of Prince Dmitry Trubetskoy laid siege to the Kremlin garrison itself, which was manned by Poles. Also inside the walls were members of the Semiboyarshchina, including the future Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov and his mother.[3]

Provisions for the garrison were collected in the Moscow region by the regiment of Jan Piotr Sapieha. According to the testimony of the memoirist Samuel Maskiewicz, ""what anyone liked, and whether the greatest boyar's wife or daughter, they took them by force.""[4] After the death of Sapieha in September 1611, Lithuanian commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz took over the difficult task of collecting food.

At the end of 1611, carts with provisions collected by Samuel Korecki reached the Kremlin. In January 1612, a regiment was able to break through to Moscow, which temporarily eased the food situation. However, the Hungarian infantrymen of Felix Nevyarovsky did not bring their provisions, and their presence only accelerated the return food scarcity.

The entire first half of 1612 was unusually cold, and many of the garrison's soldiers formed a confederation and abandoned the Russian capital. Famine began in the city; speculators sold bread at 30 times its regular price.

Russian historian Avraamy Palitsyn claims that after they entered into the Kremlin, Dmitry Troubetskoy's Cossacks discovered salted human flesh, ""and under the slings, there is a lot of human corpse,"" suggesting that the garrison resorted to cannibalism when food supplies ran out.[5]

Throughout 1612, Polish-Lithuanian formations began to leave Moscow. Commander Gosiewski left in June, along with the veterans of the Klushino Battle and the remnants of the Kremlin's treasury.[6] Mikołaj Struś commanded what remained of the garrison. The garrison itself was almost resupplied during the Battle of Moscow in September, but forces with some 400 carts of provisions were forced to retreat after getting within two kilometers of the Kremlin.

Trubetskoy's Cossacks established control of Kitay-Gorod at the beginning of November,[7] after which Struś opened negotiations on terms of surrender. The Kremlin garrison formally capitulated on November 7. Although Trubetskoy promised to ""leave the defeated in health and have respect,"" they were massacred instead: ""The Cossacks beat the whole regiment, leaving a few.""[8]

Before the Truce of Deulino was signed in 1619, which ended the Russian-Polish War and fostered an exchange of prisoners, the Poles and Lithuanians captured in the Kremlin were settled in Yaroslavl, Balakhna, Nizhny Novgorod and other Upper Volga cities. In Nizhny Novgorod, the mother of Prince Pozharsky put in her word for the prisoners, so they only were thrown ""in a dungeon very dark, poor and stinking, in which they had been sitting for nineteen weeks"".[9] The prisoners held in Galich and along the river Unzha were completely exterminated.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Lithuanian_occupation_of_Moscow
Lithuanian Education Society Rytas,"The Lithuanian Education Society Rytas (Lithuanian: Lietuvių švietimo draugija „Rytas“; ""rytas"" means morning or dawn) was a Roman Catholic society fostering education in the Lithuanian language mostly in the Vilnius Region, then fiercely contested between Lithuania and the Second Polish Republic, now split between Lithuania and Belarus. Established in 1913, the society maintained some 100 primary schools (mostly one-room schools), 50 evening classes, Vytautas the Great Gymnasium and Teacher's Seminary in Vilnius (Wilno, Vilna) in 1927.[1] Due to political tensions between Poland and Lithuania as well as wider Polonization policies, Rytas faced increasing difficulties and restrictions in maintaining its schools. Similar situation existed with Polish schools in Lithuania (see Lithuanization). The situation continued to worsen as both sides increased restrictions in retribution.[2] As schools were closed, Rytas shifted its focus to maintaining community reading rooms. After the death of Józef Piłsudski in 1935, the rooms were often raided by police and closed. Eventually, the society was abolished by Polish authorities in February 1938. Only the Vytautas the Great Gymnasium was allowed to operate. After the Polish ultimatum of March 1938, diplomatic relations were established between Poland and Lithuania and Rytas was allowed to operate again in May 1939. It could not resume its activities due to World War II and was abolished again soon after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. The society, with the same mission of promoting Lithuanian-language education, was reestablished in 2004.

After the failed Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist regime enacted strict Russification policies: the Lithuanian press was prohibited, all non-government schools were closed, and government schools prohibited the use of the Lithuanian language.[3] The restrictions were lifted in 1904 and Lithuanians organized societies Saulė (Sun) in 1906 in Kovno Governorate and Žiburys (light, beacon) in 1905 in the Suwałki Governorate to fund and operate Lithuanian schools.[3]

The developments in the Vilna Governorate, which had an ethnically mixed population, were slower. In February 1907, Lithuanian activists (Antanas Smetona, brothers Antanas and Jonas Vileišis, priests Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas and Vladas Mironas, and others) established educational Society Vilniaus Aušra (Dawn of Vilnius).[4] The first chairman was Smetona and Tumas was his secretary, but soon they resigned. The new chairman was priest Juozas Bagdonavičius (Bagdonas) and Liudas Gira was his secretary.[4] The society was active both in Kovno and Vilna Governorates and established 17 local chapters. Most active of them were in Alanta, Žasliai, Bagaslaviškis. However, Tsarist authorities closed several chapters and the society was liquidated in December 1908.[4]

The idea of an educational society was once again raised by the intellectuals in a meeting of Aušra publishers in Vilnius in 1911.[5] Its statute was approved by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 29 November 1912 and the founding meeting took place at the clergy house of the Church of All Saints, Vilnius on 31 January 1913.[5] The meeting, chaired by Jonas Basanavičius, elected a six-member board, which included priest Jonas Steponavičius (chairman), priest Vladas Mironas, writer Liudas Gira, and Jonas Basanavičius. Antanas Smetona was a candidate, but was not elected.[6]

The society's goals were to establish and fund Lithuanian-language primary schools, evening classes for adults, a seminary for teachers, reading rooms, bookshops, and other educational institutions in the Roman Catholic spirit.[5] It published its news in Viltis and Aušra and encouraged establishment of local chapters. By the end of 1913, according to a list published in Šaltinis, the society had 31 chapters, including three in Vilnius.[5] Rytas wanted to establish grammar schools (Школа грамоты) but was allowed to organize only one-year or two-year schools and only if a qualified teacher was available.[6] The first schools were organized in Dieveniškės, Linkmenys, Musteika, Perloja, Švenčionėliai, Valkininkai.[5] During the first three years, Rytas established about 120 schools.[7]

During World War I, from about August 1915 to November 1918, Vilnius Region was part of the German Oberost. Initially, the Germans banned Rytas, but after modifications to its statute, it was allowed to operate schools but not to establish new chapters.[7] Despite difficult wartime conditions, Rytas established courses for teachers, which were directed by Aleksandras Stulginskis and which grew to a seminary, and took over the Lithuanian gymnasium,[7] established by Jonas Basanavičius, Mykolas Biržiška, and Povilas Gaidelionis [lt] in October 1915. It was the second (after the Panevėžys Gymnasium which opened a week earlier) gymnasium to teach in the Lithuanian language.[8]

After the Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, Vilnius region was incorporated into the Republic of Central Lithuania, a puppet state of the Second Polish Republic. Almost immediately Lithuanian organizations, including Rytas, faced increased scrutiny and restrictions. The Lithuanian gymnasium for girls was closed in August 1921 and the boys' gymnasium (renamed to Vytautas the Great Gymnasium) was forcibly removed from its premises in October 1921.[9] In 1923, the regional education commission began demanding that each school independently obtained a permit which was valid for only a year (multi-year permits were introduced in 1927).[5] The commission had to approve each teacher, and it refused to approve if they were not Polish citizens or did not have certificates of morality (świadectwo moralności), i.e. a proof of correct political leanings. For example, in 1926, of 106 proposed teachers only 56 were approved.[5] In July 1924, Minister Stanisław Grabski sponsored a law which regulated schools of ethnic minorities.[2] Other requirements and limitations applied to teachers' education, textbooks, classroom hygiene, etc.[5] These requirements particularly affected Ukrainian and Belarusian schools. Attitudes towards Lithuanian schools were more lenient, perhaps in hopes of normalizing the tensions between Poland and Lithuania.[2]

The situation of Lithuanian schools and Rytas society began deteriorating when 44 schools and the teachers' seminary was closed on 4–5 October 1927.[5] At the same time, seminary director Kristupas Čibiras, Rytas chairman Petras Kraujalis, and 23 other Lithuanian teachers and activists were arrested.[10] It was a retribution for the Lithuanian decision to close more than 60 Polish schools in Lithuania.[11] In 1928, Rytas maintained the gymnasium in Vilnius with 366 students, a vocational evening school, teachers' courses, 103 schools with 3,560 students, and 80 evening courses for adults with 1,765 students.[5] Of the schools, only 52 had official permits. Some of the closed or non-certified schools continued to operate illegally.[5]

Teachers at Rytas schools often initiated the establishments of a local chapter of the Society of Saint Casimir for the Education and Care of Young People which became more active in 1927.[12] The two societies shared similar goals and cooperated with each other; for example, sharing Lithuanian publications.[13] In 1931, with funding from Lithuania, Rytas purchased Vileišis Palace and moved its headquarters to the first floor. The second floor and the attic was rented by the Lithuanian Scientific Society.[14]

In spring 1931, the Polish Sejm adopted a new law which further restricted private schools. No new permits were issued while old schools were closed by various inspectors.[5] The number of schools decreased from 91 in 1931 to 73 in 1932. New instructions from the Polish Ministry of Education prescribed requirements for school buildings which were practically impossible to meet – new dedicated buildings had to build.[5] In 1933, Rytas had only 21 approved schools and of those only 16 had approved teachers. Realizing that it was losing ground, Rytas began focusing on education of adults and establishing reading rooms. Most of these rooms were headed by now-unemployed teachers, others by university or gymnasium students.[5] The rooms organized readings of books and periodicals, discussions, lectures, courses for children and adults, various social events and gatherings, etc. In the 1934/35 school year, the society maintained 76 reading rooms which registered 244,805 visitors. The officials disapproved the reading rooms and frequently fined them for various minor infractions.[5]

Ludwik Bociański, appointed voivode of Wilno in December 1935, took particularly strict measures against Rytas.[5] Police raided reading rooms, confiscated the books, and closed them due to ""threat to public order and security"". In twelve instances, curators of the reading rooms were exiled.[5] In November 1936, police raided Rytas headquarters and confiscated some of its funds. The measures had its effects: in March 1936, Rytas had four schools and 77 reading rooms; a year later, it had only two schools with 77 students and 14 reading rooms.[5] Rytas activities in the Białystok Voivodeship were prohibited citing concerns over border security. No new initiatives received official approvals and the society was effectively forced to cease its activities.[5]

Sensing that its could be abolished, in 1937–1938, Rytas transferred its archives and movable property to the Lithuanian Scientific Society, which was headquartered in the same Vileišis Palace.[15] The move did not help as both Rytas and the Scientific Society, as well as seven other Lithuanian organizations, were suspended by the starosta of Vilnius in January 1938. Rytas appealed the decision to voivode Bociański, but received a negative response on 25 February and was officially closed on 28 February.[15] Rytas' property was taken over by attorney Stefan Wilanowski and the last school in Dainava was closed.[5]

After the Polish ultimatum of March 1938, diplomatic relations were established between Poland and Lithuania and Rytas was allowed to operate again on 20 May 1939. In June, it received its property back – Vileišis Palace, now subject to a 60,000 złoty mortgage to the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, 33,303 złoty receivables, and 7,745 złoty payables.[15]

Rytas was told that no schools would be approved if they were less than 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from a public Polish school and instead concentrated on reestablishing local chapters and reading rooms. From June to August, Rytas established 103 chapters with about 1,500 members.[15] Further activities were interrupted by World War II. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Vilnius Region was occupied by the Soviet Union and then partially transferred to Lithuania in October according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Due to wartime disruptions and regime changes, the society was not active. It registered with the Lithuanian government in February 1940 and called a general meeting in March searching for a new mission – a lot of its functions were taken over by the Lithuanian government and it could no longer rely on funding from the government or the public.[15] Rytas, along with other Lithuanian organizations, was abolished by the new Soviet regime following the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. The last board meeting of Rytas took place on 6 July 1940.[15]

Rytas Society was reestablished in April 2004 with the help of the Vilnija society.[16] Lithuanian activists felt that areas of southeastern Lithuania where Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania won majorities in the municipal elections neglected the education in the Lithuanian language and decided to reestablished Rytas to counter this bias.[16] Algimantas Masaitis, long-time director of a Lithuanian school in Marijampolis, Vilnius District Municipality, became its chairman.[3] The society organizes lectures, events, conferences, excursions, confers awards to distinguished teachers, provides students with school supplies, books, etc.[16]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Education_Society_Rytas

Laima,"Laima is a Baltic goddess of fate.[1] She was associated with childbirth, marriage, and death; she was also the patron of pregnant women. Laima and her functions are similar to the Hindu goddess Lakshmi.

In Latvian mythology, Laima and her sisters, Kārta and Dēkla, were a trinity of fate deities, similar to the Norse Norns or the Greek Moirai.[2] Laima makes the final decision on individual's fate and is considerably more popular. While all three of them had similar functions, Laima is the Goddess of luck and is more related with mothers and childbirth, Dēkla is in charge of children, and Kārta holds power over the adult's life.[2] In modern Dievturi these three goddesses are referred to as the three Laimas, indicating they are the same deity in three different aspects. Birth rituals at the end of the 19th century included offerings of hen, sheep, towels or other woven materials to Laima. Only women could participate in the ritual, performed in a sauna (pirtis).[3]

In Lithuanian mythology, Laima (fate, destiny) is often confused with Laimė (good fortune) and Laumė (fairy).[4] Other related deities include Dalia (fate) and Giltinė (The Reaper). Laima was first mentioned in written sources as Laimelea by Wilhelm Martini in the Latin prologue to Lithuanian songs, collected by Daniel Klein and published in 1666.[5] She was also mentioned by Matthäus Prätorius, Jacob Brodowski, Philipp Ruhig and others.[6]

One of the most important duties of Laima is to prophesy (Lithuanian: lemti) how the life of a newborn will take place.[4] Sometimes there was only one Laima, while in other cases three Laimas would give often contradictory predictions. The final pronouncement would be irrevocable and not even Laima herself could change it.[7] While three fate goddesses have less support among academics, the concept is well-established in European religions (e.g. Greek Moirai).[8] In the earlier historiography, the example of predestination by Laima was used to judge the Lithuanian religion as fatalistic. For example, in 1837 Manfred Tietz wrote that, because Lithuanians believed in the determined fate, they were fearless warriors.[9] Algirdas Julien Greimas argued that such a view is superficial and that Laima did not determine the fate but only knew about it.[8]
In one Lithuanian version of the Great Flood myth, Laima participates in the birth of the humankind.[10]

Laima was related to Gegutė (cuckoo), which Greimas considered a separate goddess[11] while others see her as an incarnation of Laima. Gegutė was responsible for time and the succession of the seasons. The number of her calls was believed to predict how long a person had left to live. In spring she would also determine how a person would spend the remainder of the year; for example, if a man had no money on him when he heard the cuckoo, he would be poor for the rest of the year.[11] Laima's sacred tree is the linden.[12]

The Lithuanian folk music group Kūlgrinda released an album in 2014 titled Laimos Giesmės, meaning ""The Hymns of Laima"".[13]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laima

Lithuanian Chronicles,"The Lithuanian Chronicles (Lithuanian: Lietuvos metraščiai; also called the Belarusian-Lithuanian Chronicles)[a][1][2] are three redactions of chronicles compiled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. All redactions were written in the Ruthenian language and served the needs of Lithuanian patriotism.[3] The first edition, compiled in the 1420s, glorified Vytautas the Great and supported his side in power struggles. The second redaction, prepared in the first half of the 16th century, started the myth of Lithuanian Roman origin: it gave a fanciful genealogy of Palemon, a noble from the Roman Empire who founded the Grand Duchy. This noble origin of Lithuanians was important in cultural rivalry with the Kingdom of Poland. The third redaction, known as the Bychowiec Chronicle, elaborated even further on the legend, but also provided some useful information about the second half of the 15th century. The three redactions, the first known historical accounts produced within the Grand Duchy, gave rise to the historiography of Lithuania.[4] All medieval historians used these accounts, that survived in over 30 known manuscripts,[5] as basis for their publications and some of the myths created in the chronicles persisted even to the beginning of the 20th century.

The first or the short redaction (also known as Chronicle of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania or Letopisec Litovskii) was compiled sometime in the 1420s in Smolensk, when Vytautas the Great hoped to be crowned as King of Lithuania.[4] This redaction included the earliest known historical account produced in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: Dis ist Witoldes sache wedir Jagalan und Skargalan, a complaint and memorial written by Vytautas in 1390 during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392).[6] It detailed his power struggles against cousins Jogaila and Skirgaila in 1379–1390 and supported his claims to his patrimony in Trakai and title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. Two translations of this document survive: Latin Origo regis Jagyelo et Witholdi ducum Lithuanie from the 15th century and Ruthenian Litovskomu rodu pochinok from the 14th century.[3] Later this document was expanded to include events up to 1396.[7] It formed the backbone of the first chronicle.

The first redaction survived only from later manuscripts and compilations. The earliest known compilation was prepared in Smolensk around 1446 by bishop Gerasim and his clerk Timofei.[6] The compilation also included a praise to Vytautas, written by Gerasim, a story about Podolia, written in 1431–1435 to support the Lithuanian claims against Poland in the Lithuanian Civil War,[7] a description of power struggles between Švitrigaila and Sigismund Kęstutaitis, a short summary of Moscow's chronicles (854–1428),[3] and latest events in Smolensk (1431–1445).[6] The compilation also did not survive in its original state. It is known from several manuscripts:[6][8]

The second, more extensive, redaction (also known as Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia) was compiled in the second half of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century[3] (the final version probably came into existence around the 1520s at the court of Albertas Goštautas).[9] The redaction traced back the foundations of the Lithuanian state to the 1st century, when legendary Palemon escaped from Roman Empire and settled at the mouth of Dubysa. He founded the Palemonids dynasty and became the first ruler of Lithuania.[6] This legendary part was then followed by the revised first redaction, detailing the lineage of the Gediminids. Mindaugas, the first King of Lithuania crowned in 1253, and other earlier historically attested dukes were skipped entirely.[4] The elaborate story that Lithuanians were of noble Roman origins had no historical basis and was discarded by modern historians as nothing more than a myth.[10]

While many modern historians discount the text as useless, it can still provide useful bits and pieces of Lithuanian history as it incorporates many garbled fragments of earlier, now lost, documents and chronicles.[10] Also, the mythical Palemon is a good evidence of political tensions and cultural ideology of the Lithuanian nobles in the 16th century. This myth served Lithuanian interests in conflicts with Poland and Muscovy. Poland, then in personal union with Lithuania, claimed that it brought civilization to this barbaric pagan land. By creating fanciful genealogies, linking Lithuanians with noble Romans, the Lithuanian nobility could counter these claims and demand political independence.[6]

This redaction rarely included dates and contained several independent stories that were cherished by 19th century nationalists: legends how Gediminas founded Vilnius because of his dreams of Iron Wolf, how Kęstutis took pagan priestess Birutė for his wife, how Vytautas lavishly treated his guests at the Conference of Lutsk in 1429, etc.[6] Among them were some factual stories, including Algirdas' three sieges of Moscow.[7] This format differed significantly from other Slavic chronicles that tended to list inter-related events year-by-year.[3] The second redaction also considerably trimmed and fragmented parts about Ruthenia and the Principality of Moscow; thus the text became primarily about Lithuania. The chronicle was popular and often copied.[4] It shaped the political mentality of the Lithuanian nobility, formed the basis for the Lithuanian historiography until the dawn of the 20th century, and inspired many literary works.

The third and most extensive redaction is known as the Bychowiec Chronicle. It is based on the second redaction. It is believed that this redaction was prepared around the same time as the second redaction with support from Albertas Goštautas.[11] The only known version was discovered in a manor owned by Aleksander Bychowiec and was published in full by Teodor Narbutt in 1846. This chronicle was updated to include events up to 1574.[10] Initially there were doubts if the chronicle is authentic and some suggested that Narbutt falsified it. The doubts were inspired by its sudden discovery and its peculiar similarity with the chronicles of Maciej Stryjkowski; also Narbutt is suspected to have falsified several other historical documents.[4] However, new evidence came to light that portions of the chronicle were published in 1830. Historians now suggest that similarity with Stryjkowski's works resulted from using the same document, maybe even the original third redaction, as the source.[6] Further, in 2011, Lithuanian historians discovered a fragment (about one-fifth of the original) of the third redaction at the National Archives in Kraków [pl] and published it in 2018.[12]

The patriotic themes were even more prevalent than in the second redaction. It continued to elaborate on the Palemon legend: to improve chronology Palemon was moved to the 5th century Rome, devastated by Attila the Hun, and Mindaugas and other historical dukes were incorporated into the legend.[4] It also concentrated more on the Catholic Church than earlier revisions, which paid closer attention to Eastern Orthodoxy.[10] It is an important source for the late 15th century events, especially years of Alexander Jagiellon.[3]

The popularity of the Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all of Ruthenia, published by Maciej Stryjkowski in 1582, pushed the old handwritten Lithuanian chronicles into obscurity.[5] They were rediscovered with the advent of professional historiography in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when historians began to critically analyze primary sources to verify various claims. That necessitated the publication of primary sources. The first Lithuanian Chronicle, the Supraśl Manuscript, was published in 1823 by Ignacy Daniłowicz [pl].[8] In 1846, Teodor Narbutt published the Bychowiec Chronicle. Other historians published other manuscripts that they had found. In 1860s, the Archaeographic Commission became interested in collecting and publishing all known manuscripts of the Lithuanian Chronicles. Twelve manuscripts were published in 1907 as volume 17 of the Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles as West Russian Chronicles (Russian: Западнорусские летописи), which became the standard reference. The collection, newly compiled and edited by Mikałaj Ułaščyk, was published as volumes 32 (1975) and 35 (1980) of the Complete Collection.[8] However, despite the discovery of several other manuscripts since 1907, the new volumes did not include them.[13]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Chronicles
Denmark–Lithuania relations,"Denmark–Lithuania relations refers to the historical and current diplomatic relations between Denmark and Lithuania. Lithuania has an embassy in Copenhagen, and Denmark has an embassy in Vilnius.[1][2] Denmark first recognized Lithuania in 1921 and again on 28 February 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union. Diplomatic relations were established on 24 August 1991.[3] The Danish recognition in 1991 has been described as ""extremely important for Lithuania"".[4] Both countries are members of the European Union, NATO, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Council of Europe.

Since Lithuanian independence, Denmark has taken a leading role in supporting Lithuania with international recognition and military and internal reforms. Denmark also played a significant role in Lithuania's accession to the EU and maintains a military presence in the country.[5]

Relations have been described as a friendly political relationship with strong defence cooperation, and active trade and investment ties.[6] The two countries cooperate closely on the political situation in Belarus and Ukraine[7] with Denmark having sent four F-16 jets to Lithuania in 2022 as a response to the Russo-Ukrainian crisis.[8]

Interactions have existed between Denmark and Lithuania since the Middle Ages which were intensified after the emergence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Denmark temporarily sided with the Teutonic Order during its war against Poland and Lithuania in 1409–1411. Prince George of Denmark was a candidate in the 1674 Polish–Lithuanian royal election.[9] State-to-state level interactions ceased to exist with the dissolution of the Polish–Lithuanian monarchy by the end of the 18th century.[10]

In the subsequent period, Lithuania had become an almost unknown culture and territory to the Danes. This changed after Danish traveler and ethnologist Åge Meyer Benedictsen published his oeuvre ""Lithuania – the Awakening of a Nation. Pictures of Lithuanian Culture"" in 1895. It contributed greatly to Lithuania's representation in Denmark.[10]

On 26 September 1921, Danish King Christian X endorsed the proposal from the Danish government to recognize Lithuania de jure. Denmark had coordinated this decision with Norway and Sweden and informed Lithuania of their decision on 28 September 1921.[10]

Relations between the two countries were primarily focused on finding common ground on agriculture, infrastructure projects, trade and economic cooperation. At first, Danish businesses wanted to use Lithuania as a bridge to the more difficult Russian market but these hopes were abandoned and activities in Lithuania were more directed towards Lithuanian potential and development.[11]

After World War I, as part of the Polish–Lithuanian War, the League of Nations planned on holding a referendum for the future of Vilnius and the border areas between Poland and Lithuania, and approached Denmark to send a small contingency acting as a peace-keeping force for the referendum. However, the referendum was not held and the Danish soldiers never left for Lithuania either.[11]

Diplomatic relations ceased to exist during World War II as Denmark became occupied by Nazi Germany while Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. No official contacts existed between Denmark and the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.[11] Denmark never recognized Soviet sovereignty over Lithuania and was the first country to establish diplomatic relations with the new Lithuanian state on 24 August 1991, on the instruction of Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.[12]

Prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimira Prunskienė had visited Denmark in April 1990 prompting protest from Soviet authorities. However, the Danes responded by stating that the recognition from 1921 was still valid.[14]

On 20 December 1990, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Algirdas Saudargas visited Copenhagen for the opening of the Baltic Information Office where he also met Ellemann-Jensen. The Baltic Office in Copenhagen played an instrumental role in the establishment of diplomatic relations between Lithuania and other states.[15] The Baltic Office was closed and three separate Baltic embassies were established by the end of 1991.[16] In February 1991, the two countries signed a joint protocol of cooperation in which it is stated that Denmark would continue to support Lithuania on the international scene and that diplomatic relations would sume resume. The Soviet Union reacted strongly to the statement.[17] As diplomatic relations were established in August 1991, Queen Margrethe II insisted on receiving the three visiting Baltic foreign ministers despite being at her summer palace. Some weeks later, Elleman-Jensen visited Lithuania in his first visit to the country.[18]

In September 1991, Audrius Butkevičius, General Director of the Lithuanian Defence Department visited Copenhagen where he held various meetings to strengthen military relations, including with Chairman of the Parliamentary Defense Committee Hans Hækkerup. Hækkerup would later become Minister of Defence in 1993. Lithuania wished to become integrated into the European system of defense and have closer military relations with Denmark.[19] For this, Denmark accredited the Danish Lieutenant Colonel Carsten Barløse as the first Defence Attaché to Lithuania in July 1992. One of the major tasks for the new Defence Attaché was to support the visit of Queen Margrethe II to Lithuania set to take place on 31 July 1992. During her visit, the Queen visited Antakalnis Cemetery.[20] Later same year, a Lithuanian military delegation led by Lieutenant Colonel Valdas Tutkus visited Denmark where they met Chief of Defence Jørgen Lyng. This was the first Lithuanian military delegation to another country and as part of the conversations on cooperation, Denmark agreed to train members of the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces in Denmark.[21] In March 1994, the first agreement on military cooperation was signed focusing on the modernization of the Lithuanian armed forces. During the meeting, Denmark offered a handful of Lithuanian officers a chance of conducting a tour with the Danish battalion in Croatia where they would be able to collect first-hand impressions from a UN peacekeeping mission.[22] On 16 July 1994, a Danish infantry platoon consisting of 87 men was deployed to Rukla by sea and air visiting different training areas to assess areas where the two armies could cooperate. This became the first NATO army unit on Lithuanian soil and was followed by another Danish military visit the next day as Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying 75 soldiers landed at Karmelava military airport. The goal of the second unit was to train Lithuanian officers for the mission to Croatia, an operation which would give them international experience. On 22 August 1994, the joint Danish and Lithuanian unit deployed to Croatia as part of the United Nations Protection Force.[23] In 1996, Lithuania also joined Denmark in the Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina,[24] in Kosovo Force in Kosovo and Dancon/Irak in Iraq.[25] About a thousand Lithuanian soldiers were trained for these missions.[25]

Throughout the 1990s, Denmark had become a staunch supporter of incorporating Lithuania into NATO and the EU and rendered considerable assistance to Lithuania militarily and economically.[26] Lithuania becoming a member of NATO in 2004 was a Danish goal and the military cooperation only continued afterwards. The Mechanised Infantry Brigade Iron Wolf became affiliated with the Danish Division in 2006 and some of its officials were based in Haderslev.[27]

From 1996 to 2007, Lithuanian naval officers studied at the Royal Danish Naval Academy and procured 3 Standart Flex 300 vessels from Denmark between 2007 and 2010.[28]

In 2011, Danish Defence Minister Nick Hækkerup visited Lithuania.[29]

When Denmark took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1993, the council assured that Lithuania would become a member of the union as soon as the Copenhagen criteria were fulfilled. For this, Denmark supported and mentored Lithuania on wide-range subjects from negotiations with the European Union to local bureaucratic projects.[30] To prepare ten Eastern European countries for EU membership, Denmark began the FEU program of which Lithuania received the most funds and most projects (26% of projects and 33% of committed funds). At the Helsinki European Council in 1999, Lithuania presented the results of their reforms to the council which exceeded expectations, and Denmark could therefore rely on these results in persuading the other EU countries for a Lithuanian membership. As the EU opened negotiations with Lithuania after the Helsinki meeting, Denmark began assisting Lithuania so the latter would be better equipped for the negotiations. Denmark moreover negotiated for financial support from the EU for Lithuania to close down Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant – a prerequisite for membership.[31] In 2002, Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus stated that Denmark was the largest sponsor of the country.[32]

Lithuania became a member of the European Union on 1 May 2004.[33]

Lithuanian President Rolandas Paksas visited Denmark in April 2003[34] and Dalia Grybauskaitė in both 2013 and 2016.[35][36]

Conversely, Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen visited Lithuania in 2000,[37] Anders Fogh Rasmussen in 2005,[38] Helle Thorning-Schmidt in 2011 and Lars Løkke Rasmussen in 2018.[39][40]

Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen accompanied by leaders of five parliamentary parties paid a visit to the Šiauliai Air Base in late March 2022. The air base hosted Danish F-16 jets.[41]

Trade between the two countries have been described as healthy.[42] The following table shows the annual trade numbers between the two countries from 1992 to 2020 in euro:[43]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark–Lithuania_relations

Subdivisions of the Polish–Lithuanian territories following the partitions,"Following three consecutive partitions of Poland carried out between 1772 and 1795, the sovereign state known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth disappeared from the map of Europe. In 1918 following the end of World War I, the territories of the former state re-emerged as the states of Poland and Lithuania among others. In the intervening period, the territory of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was split between the Austrian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and the Russian Empire. These powers subdivided the territories that they gained and created new toponyms for the territories conquered. The subdivisions created were complicated by changes within those empires as well as by the periodic establishment of other forms of the quasi-Polish provinces led by a foreign head of state.

The below subdivisions do not cover the administrative divisions of the French vassal state created by Napoleon - the Duchy of Warsaw. See subdivisions of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1815). For the administrative division of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before its final third partition, see subdivisions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For the subdivisions of the lands awarded to the Russian Empire, see subdivisions of Congress Poland (1815–1918) and History of the administrative division of Russia. For subdivisions of the lands awarded to the Kingdom of Prussia, see Provinces of Prussia.

The Austrian Empire, known from the second half of the 19th century as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, annexed territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the First Partition (1772) and the Third Partition (1795).[1] The territories obtained were subdivided into:

In the First Partition, the Austrian Empire received the largest share of the Polish population, and second largest land share (83,000 km2 and over 2.65 million people). Austria did not participate in the Second partition. In the Third Partition, Austria annexed 47,000 km2 of territories with 1.2 million people. Overall, Austria gained about 18 percent of the former Commonwealth's territory (130,000 km2) and about 32 percent of its population (3.85 million people).[1] From the geographical perspective, much of the Austrian partition corresponded to the Galicia region.

The Kingdom of Prussia (known from second half of the 19th century as German Empire) annexed territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in all three partitions.[1] The territories obtained were subdivided into the following.[2]

In the First Partition, Prussia has received 36,000 km2 and about 0.6 million people. In the second partition, Prussia had received 58,000 km2 and about 1 million people. In the third, similar to the second, Prussia gained 55,000 km2 and 1 million people. Overall, Prussia had gained about 20 percent of the former Commonwealth territory  (149 000 km2) and about 23 percent of the population (2.6 million people).[1] From the geographical perspective, much of the territories annexed by Prussia formed the province of Greater Poland (Wielkopolska).

The Russian Empire which acquired the territories of the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in all three Partitions,[1] divided the former territories of the Commonwealth by either creating or enlarging the following guberniyas.[2]

After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Russian Empire created a separate entity called Congress Poland. See administrative division of Congress Poland for details. Territories in the Russian partition which were not incorporated into Congress Poland were known as the Western Krai (combination of Northwestern and Southwestern Krais), and in Poland as the taken lands (Polish: ziemie zabrane).

The Western Krai comprised the following lands of the Commonwealth:

It consisted of 9 guberniyas: six Belarusian and Lithuanian ones that constituted the Northwestern Krai (Vilna Governorate, Kovno Governorate, Grodno Governorate, Minsk Governorate, Mogilev Governorate and Vitebsk Governorate) and three Ukrainian ones that constituted the Southwestern Krai (Volhynia Governorate, Podolia Governorate and Kiev Governorate).

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was transformed into Courland Governorate (Government of Courland) and grouped with the Baltic governorates also known as Governments of Ostsee.

In the first partition, Russia gained 92,000 square kilometres (36,000 sq mi) and 1.3 million people. In the second, 250,000 km2 and 1 million people. In the third, 120,000 km2 and 1.2 million people. Overall, Russia had gained about 62 percent of the former Commonwealth territory (462,000 km2) and about 45 percent of the population (3.5 million people).[1]

During World War I (1914–1918), much of the territories became occupied by the Central Powers (primarily, German Empire) and became administered by the Ober Ost.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_the_Polish–Lithuanian_territories_following_the_partitions
Zenonas Ivinskis,"Zenonas Ivinskis (25 May 1908 in Kaušėnai village, near Plungė – 24 December 1971 in Bonn, West Germany) was a noted Lithuanian historian.

Ivinskis studied at Telšiai and Plungė gymnasiums. In 1925 he entered the University of Lithuania to study philosophy, but later changed the subject to history. In 1929, Ivinskis received a grant to continue his studies in Germany. There, under the direction of prof. Albert Brackmann, he received a Ph.D. for his thesis Geschichte des Bauerstandes in Litauen (English: History of the Conditions of Lithuanian Farmers) in 1932. In 1933 in Gdańsk he was habilitated for his work Lietuvių ir prūsų prekybiniai santykiai pirmojoje XVI a. pusėje (English: Lithuanian and Prussian trade in the first half of the 16th century).

After returning to Lithuania he was drafted into the army. During his free time, he gave lectures at the Vytautas Magnus University and in 1940 became an extraordinary professor. In that year he was invited to work at the Vilnius University. He served as the dean of Faculty of Theology–Philosophy at the Vytautas Magnus University from 1941 to 1942. For his active public defense of university autonomy, the Nazis listed him among other prominent public figures to be transferred to Stutthof concentration camp. Ivinskis was saved from death because he was ill, and was hospitalized for half a year.

In 1944, Ivinskis retreated to the West. Unlike most other Lithuanian refugees, he did not emigrate to the United States and chose to live in Germany. He gave lectures as Gastprofessor at Baltisches Forchungsinstitut in Bonn, and from 1963 taught the history of Eastern Europe at Bonn University. The next year he received his second habilitation in Lithuanian and Polish history and was appointed as a full-time professor. While living in Germany he often traveled to Rome, and conducted research at the Vatican archives. Ivinskis contributed to the Lithuanian encyclopedias published in Boston.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenonas_Ivinskis

Rail transport in Lithuania,"Rail transport in Lithuania consists of freight shipments and passenger services. The construction of the first railway line in Lithuania began in 1859. As of 2021[update], the total length of railways in Lithuania was 1,868.8 km (1,161.2 mi). LTG Group (Lietuvos Geležinkeliai), the national state-owned railway company, operates most of the country's passenger and freight services via its subsidiaries LTG Link (passenger) and LTG Cargo (freight).

The country has a mixed gauge network: the majority is broad gauge (a legacy of the Russian standard) with new lines often using standard gauge or dual gauge track.  In 2020, Lithuania together with the other Baltic states began construction of the Rail Baltica high-speed rail with operating speed of 249 km/h for the passenger trains. The project marks a new era for  Lithuanian railways and is expected to be completed by 2030.

Lithuania is a member of the Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF) and International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Lithuania is 24.  As an EU member, the country participates in the European Union Agency for Railways. It is also a member of Interrail and Eurail. Lithuania was ranked 16th among national European rail systems in the European Railway Performance Index 2017 assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety.[6]

In 1851, the government of the Russian Empire decided to build the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw railway.[7] The construction of the railway in Lithuania began in 1859 and the line included Daugavpils–Vilnius–Grodno and Lentvaris–Kaunas–Virbalis sections which were completed in 1862.[7] The first train arrived from Daugavpils (in Latvia) to Vilnius on 17 September 1860.[4] However, the first commercial operation began between Kaunas temporary station on the left bank of the river Nemunas and Eydtkuhnen in East Prussia on 11 April 1861. Initially, there were 21 Lithuanian stations.[7] Building of the railway required different engineering solutions, including the construction of Kaunas Railway Tunnel and Paneriai Tunnel.[8] The greatest expansion of the railway happened during 1857–1914 when nearly two thirds of the network, used at the end of 20th century, was constructed.[4] The railway construction had a significant impact to the economic development of the region.[9]

When the Imperial German Army occupied Lithuania in 1915, the railway became the main way to supply food and ammunition for the German army.[9] During this time, Germans replaced a lot of the 1524 mm gauge railways track with the 1435 mm standard gauge.[8] In various parts of the country, the German army also constructed 600 mm gauge tracks.[8] Lithuanian independence was restored in 1918 and the Lithuanian government concluded an agreement with Germany on 4 July 1919 on the handover of the railway assets to the Ministry of Transport.[8] During the years after World War I, Lithuanian Railways reconstructed the tracks, connecting them into a complete network. In 1923 the Klaipėda region was reunited with Lithuania and the port of Klaipėda became a part of the Lithuanian railway system.[9] The interwar period was marked by the expansion of the narrow gauge railways which contributed to the economic development of the rural areas, especially in the north-eastern Lithuania.[9]

In 1940, following the Soviet occupation, railway activities were reorganized and all agreements concluded by Lithuania with neighbouring countries terminated. Soviets changed most of the network from the standard gauge to broad gauge.[7] The railway gauge was again changed by Nazi occupying force in 1941 and then once again changed back by the Soviets in 1944.[7] After the World War II, the railway network required significant repairs. The Soviets also replaced a lot of the narrow gauge railway with the broad gauge and, in fact, completely dismantled 400 kilometres (250 mi) of it.[9][4] During the Soviet occupation all railways in the Baltic states were managed from Riga.[7] The first electric train began service on 29 December 1975 after the electrification of the Vilnius–Kaunas line.[7]

Following the independence restoration in 1991, Lithuania restored its membership in international rail transport organizations, established national railway company Lietuvos geležinkeliai AB and began gradual modernization of its railway network.  In 2000s, that included speed improvements (up to 160 km/h — passenger trains, 120 km/h — freight trains), modern communication and safety systems (GSM-R and ERTMS), new trains and locomotives (manufactured by Siemens AG, Pesa, Škoda).[7] In 2020, the construction of the high-speed Rail Baltica began.

In late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Lithuanian cities used the wagonways i.e. trams pulled by horses which were colloquially called ""konkė"".[10] Kaunas had one wagonway line from 1892 until 1929.[11] Vilnius had three wagonway lines from 1893 to 1925 using the metre-gauge railway.[10] The wagonways lost popularity due to the emergence of buses and cars. Vilnius, however, briefly had a diesel tramway with a sole line between 1924 and 1926[10] and Kaunas had a narrow gauge passenger line of steam tramway, called kukushka before 1935.[12] During the interwar period there were plans to revive electric tramways both in Vilnius and Kaunas, but they never materialized. Klaipėda, on the other hand, had an electric tramway with 2 active lines from 1904 to 1934.[13] It was revived again in 1950 but due to the lack of popularity closed in 1967.[14]

National state-owned railway company Lietuvos Geležinkeliai (LTG) provides most of the rail services through its subsidiary companies: LTG Link provides passenger services, while LTG Cargo provides freight service.[15] Another subsidiary, LTG Infra, is responsible for the maintenance and development of the infrastructure.

Vilnius—Riga—Tallinn passenger train route is technically possible, but currently not practical due to limited speeds and long travel times.[21] These routes will start following the completion of the Rail Baltica project.[21]

The old fleet of passenger trains included the ER9M electric train; D1, DR1A/DR1AM and AR2 diesel multiple units; TEP60/TEP70/TEP70BS and M62/2M62/2M62U diesel locomotives.[22]  Some are still in service, but the vast majority are retired.

As of 2021[update], the main passenger train models include Škoda EJ575 (electric) and diesel Pesa 620M/630M/730ML as well as some RA2 trains. A public procurement was launched in 2021 to replace all diesel passenger trains with a fleet of new electric trains.[15] In 2023, LTG Link signed a contract with the Swiss Stadler Rail company for a delivery of 15 new Stadler FLIRT electric and battery-electric trains.[23] The contract also provides an option for another 39 trains.[23]

As of 2021[update], Lithuania has three intermodal terminals:[24]

LTG Cargo company provides freight transportation corridors for or between the following regions:

LTG Cargo primarily uses Siemens ER20 ""Eurorunner"" locomotives for the freight trains.[34]

As of 2021[update], there is a total of 1,910 km (1,190 mi) of railways:[3]

Line between Mockava and Šeštokai uses dual gauge supporting both the broad and standard gauge.[3]

Lithuania uses 25 kV 50 Hz AC for the electrified railway lines.[35] This will remain compatible with the technical requirements for the Rail Baltica high-speed rail.  The electrification was first implemented in 1975 for the Vilnius–Kaunas line.[7] This was followed by the electrification of Vilnius–Naujoji Vilnia, Vilnius–Trakai lines and, since 2017, Vilnius–Minsk line.[36]

As of 2021[update], only 10% of the railways in Lithuania are electrified, but major electrification projects are in progress with the intention of achieving 50%.[37] In 2019, a joint consortium of Spanish companies Elecnor and Abengoa was awarded a contract to carry out electrification of 730 km (450 mi) of railway.[38] In October 2022, a contract was awarded to ABB to supply 25kV AC electrification system.[39] It primarily includes the electrification of the Vilnius–Klaipėda line and a bypass rail around Vilnius. In 2020, LTG set itself a long-term goal of achieving zero CO2 emissions by 2030.[15] In 2021, LTG Link announced the public procurement to acquire 30 electric trains in order to replace the existing diesel fleet.[40] In June 2023, LTG Link ordered 15 FLIRT multiple-units and plans to procure up to 13 additional Flirt inter-city EMUs, 15 battery-electric Flirt trains with a 100km range and 11 battery-electric Flirt multiple-units with a 70km range.[41]

Lithuania has a narrow gauge line of 750 mm (2 ft 5+1⁄2 in) first constructed in 1891.[42] It was built as a cheaper alternative to the wider gauge railway.[8] In 1996, the narrow gauge railway was declared a heritage railway and, in 2003, the Panevėžys–Anykščiai–Rubikiai line was included into the national list of preserved cultural heritages.[43] The total length of the preserved railway is 179 km (111 mi).[42] Today, the active part of the railway is 68.4 km (42.5 mi), making it one of the longest narrow gauge lines in Europe.[44]

In 2001, Aukštaitija narrow gauge railway was established as a separate company (independent from the Lithuanian Railways) to manage the narrow gauge railway.[42] It primarily runs services for tourism and entertainment.[42] It operates tourist trains ran by the TU2 diesel locomotives.[45]

Rail Baltica is an ongoing greenfield railway infrastructure project which will link all Baltic States, including Lithuania, Poland and, eventually, Finland.  Being a part of the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T), it is one of the priority projects of the European Union.[46] It will introduce standard-gauge high-speed rail with an operating speed of 249 km/h for passenger trains.[46] As of 2023, the Rail Baltica project completion is scheduled for 2030, with a start of services on some of the sections in 2028.[47]

In Lithuania, 392 km (244 mi) of new track will be constructed, including the reconstruction of the Vilnius–Kaunas Railway to support standard gauge.[48]  High speed rail will reduce the Vilnius—Kaunas route time to 38 minutes.[17] At project completion, the following routes will become available or faster (with projected travel times):[17]

As of 2021[update], the project is in progress with major construction ongoing in Lithuania.  The standard gauge line between the Polish border and Kaunas has been built, with freight services already operating between Germany and Kaunas Intermodal Terminal as well as passenger train service between Kaunas and Białystok.[48] The construction works for the line between Kaunas and the Latvian border are expected to begin in 2021.[48]

A 2022 European Union proposal is for all new rail lines to be Standard Gauge and a rolling plan introduced to convert other gauges to European standard gauge.[49]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Lithuania
2024 Lithuanian presidential election,"Presidential elections were held in Lithuania on 12 May 2024, alongside a referendum on allowing multiple citizenships.[1] Incumbent President Gitanas Nausėda won re-election to a second term. When candidate registrations closed before the election, the Lithuanian Central Election Commission [lt] had confirmed fifteen viable registrations; of those, twelve proceeded to collect signatures from the minimum 20,000 voters. Four of those contenders were later repudiated or dropped out,[2] leaving eight on the ballot.[3]

A second round was held on 26 May as no candidate received an absolute majority in the first round.[4] This saw Nausėda and Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė facing off in the runoff, a rematch of the 2019 election in which Nausėda had defeated Šimonytė. Nausėda won re-election, defeating Šimonytė in a second-round landslide with 75% of the vote – the largest margin of victory in a free election for any presidential candidate in the history of Lithuania.

The Lithuanian president has somewhat more executive authority than their counterparts in neighboring Estonia and Latvia; the Lithuanian president's function is similar to that of the presidents of France and Romania. Similarly to them, but unlike presidents in a fully presidential system such as the United States, the Lithuanian president generally has the most authority in foreign affairs. In addition to the customary diplomatic powers of heads of state, namely receiving the letters of credence of foreign ambassadors and signing treaties, the president determines Lithuania's basic foreign policy guidelines. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, and accordingly heads the State Defense Council and has the right to appoint the Chief of Defence (subject to Seimas consent).[5]

The president has a significant role in domestic policy, possessing the right to submit bills to the Seimas and to veto laws passed by it, appointing the prime minister and approving the government formed by them, and also having the right to dissolve the Seimas and call snap elections following a successful motion of no confidence or if the Seimas refuses to approve the government's budget within sixty days. However, the next elected Seimas may retaliate by calling for an earlier presidential election.[6] In addition, according to a resolution by the Constitutional Court of Lithuania in 1998, the president is required by law to nominate the candidate of the parliamentary majority to the office of prime minister.[7]

The president also holds informal power, as the office of president is generally more trusted by the populace according to approval polling, and Lithuanian presidents historically blocked legislation and forced the resignation of prime ministers (such as Gediminas Vagnorius in 1998).[7]

The president is elected using the two-round system. To win in the first round, a candidate requires an absolute majority of all votes cast (including invalid votes) and either voter turnout to be above 50% or for their vote share to be equivalent to at least one-third of the number of registered voters. If no candidate wins in the first round, a second round is required, featuring the top two candidates. All candidates for president are independent. While some candidates belong to and/or are supported by a political party, the office of the president is formally non-partisan.[8]

Citizens of Lithuania at least 40 years of age whose at least one parent was also a citizen (natural-born-citizen clause), who have lived in Lithuania for at least three years prior, are not serving a prison sentence, are not on active duty in the Lithuanian Armed Forces, are not bound to any other country by an oath and have never been impeached, are allowed to run for president. Each candidate must collect at least 20 thousand signatures by Lithuanian citizens to be able to run for election.[9][10]

All pre-registered candidates were required to finalize the registration procedure by 8 March 2024, in order to commence the collection of signatures for the confirmation of their candidacy. Ten out of 15 candidates completed this before the start of the procurement phase.[11] Two candidates managed to resolve it afterwards. Three other aspirants chose against launching a presidential bid or were eliminated due to the failure to complete the procedure before the deadline.[12]

All declared candidates for president had to gather 20,000 signatures physically or online in order to be registered and present them by 28 March 2024 at 17:00 EET.[13][14] Four failed or dropped out in the process,[15] so the following eight candidates appeared on the ballot on 12 May.[3]

These individuals registered to run in the elections, but withdrew from the race before the first ballot. Candidates that withdrew until 2 April 2024 (2024-04-02) are eliglible to have their deposit refunded. They are also required to empty their campaign fund by refunding any remaining donations.[40]

Until 19 February 2024, any eligible citizen had the opportunity to freely register for the upcoming election and start receiving campaign donations. However, the period solely served as a declaration to run and does not grant the permit to commence the collection of signatures of support.[54] Every declared candidate must complete registration by 8 March 2024, which includes payment of the €8,995 election deposit.[55]

Andrej Deivis Ginevičas, Antanas Kandrotas, Irma Gajauskaitė, and Jonas Jankauskas were denied formal registration as candidates due to their failure to provide all relevant documents during the registration process.[61][62]

Petras Gražulis was denied registration as a candidate due to his ineligibility for the office, as he had been impeached by the Seimas in 2023.[63]

These individuals either considered a presidential bid or were proposed as potential candidates during the campaign.

Incumbent President Gitanas Nausėda sought re-election against a range of opponents including Ingrida Šimonytė, his runoff challenger in the 2019 Lithuanian presidential election and incumbent Prime Minister of Lithuania. After announcing his bid on 7 December 2023, Nausėda became the clear frontrunner,[88] while Šimonytė was the sole woman vying for the presidency. Former chairman of the Lithuanian Bar Association Ignas Vėgėlė was considered to be an anti-establishment candidate,[89][90] although several candidates contended for the protest vote.[91] Eduardas Vaitkus was regarded as the pro-Russian candidate in the election and received support from the Polish-majority Šalčininkai region and Visaginas, which is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Russians.[92]

National security in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the financing of the military, universal conscription,[93] managing effects of the ageing population, cost of living,[94] the One China Policy,[95] ratification of the Istanbul Convention, Nausėda's 2019 presidential campaign and alleged connections with business interests from Russia and Belarus,[96][97][98] the Šimonytė Cabinet[89] and its conflict with Nausėda[99] emerged as potential leading issues during the campaign. Both Nausėda and Šimonytė agreed on increasing defense spending and strengthening relations with NATO, but diverged on other issues such as economic policy and same-sex unions, which Nausėda opposes.[100][101] Both candidates also shared diverging views on the Taiwanese Representative Office in Lithuania, whose naming after the island rather than the standard practice of using its capital Taipei led to diplomatic and economic sanctions from China. Nausėda supports having the office change its name, which Šimonytė opposes.[100]

Following the results of the first round, Nausėda expressed thanks to the Lithuanian people for their support during his five years in office despite challenges such as inequality, while Šimonytė said the results indicated support for her premiership. Ignas Vėgėlė attributed his defeat to the distribution of votes among the candidates who campaigned on a change platform and his lack of political experience.[102]

Campaign funding in elections in Lithuania is heavily restricted. The maximum amount each candidate is limited to raise is €2 million. Only individuals living in Lithuania and registered political parties may provide funding for a candidate. The candidate themselves may contribute a maximum of €36,000 or one fifth of their total declared income and assets. Individuals who had yet to declare income can only donate up to €50 through the entire electoral cycle, whereas individuals who had done so may contribute a maximum of €18,000 or one tenth of their total declared income and assets.[citation needed]

The system has been criticized for providing for a handicapped, monotonous campaign and diluting the chance of unknown candidates to spread their message to wider, untapped audiences.[103]

Names in italic indicate politicians who have been added to presidential election opinion polls despite not considering a bid.

Early voting for the first round was conducted from 8 to 10 May, during which more than 91,000 people, or 3.8% of eligible voters participated.[120] Voting for those who cannot leave their homes was held from 10 to 11 May.[121] On the first round of regular voting on 12 May, polling opened at 07:00 and lasted until 20:00 local time. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe did not send election monitors to Lithuania for the first time after it turned down an invitation by the government due to its refusal to admit monitors from Russia and Belarus on national security grounds, which the OSCE said was a violation of its rules.[4] This led Ignas Vėgėlė to criticize what he called a ""lack of transparency"" due to their absence. Two thousand other monitors were allowed to observe the election.[122] No election-related incidents were recorded by Lithuanian authorities.[123]

For the second round, early voting began on 21 May and closed on 23 May. Voting in designated locations outside normal polling areas was held from 22 May to 25 May, while voting for those unable to vote in person was held from 24 May to 25 May. Turnout in early voting reached 11.03% of the electorate. On 26 May, polling was held from 07:00 to 20:00.[124][125][126] While voting was underway on 26 May, Nauseda was warned by the electoral commission after he issued a message on Facebook urging voters to await the results in the gardens of the presidential palace, which the agency deemed to be a possible violation of the rule of silence during election time. His office denied that the post amounted to electoral campaigning and that he would not remove the post.[100]

No candidate received an absolute majority (over 50% of the votes cast) in the first round of voting on 12 May. A second round was held on 26 May. Of the eight candidates, incumbent President Gitanas Nausėda won 44.46% and Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė won 20.02% of votes in the first round, finishing first and second respectively, and they were the only two candidates to appear on the runoff ballot for the second round.[127][128] Nausėda won the first round in all municipalities except in Vilnius, which voted for Šimonytė, and Šalčininkai and Visaginas, which were won by Eduardas Vaitkus.[129] Turnout in the first round was at 59.37%, the third highest for an election in Lithuania since the 1993 and 1997 presidential elections.[123]

After the first round, Šimonytė was endorsed by Žalimas, and Nausėda was endorsed by Žemaitaitis and Vėgėlė.[130] Vaitkus stated that he will spoil his ballot.[131] The second round results showed Nausėda winning about three-quarters of the vote, allowing him to declare victory.[132] This was the highest majority for a presidential runoff in Lithuania.[133]

Following the release of the election results for the second round, Šimonytė conceded defeat,[132] and said that she would continue in office as prime minister. Nausėda acknowledged that the electorate had given him their mandate and said that he ""will have to cherish this credit of trust"". Final turnout was estimated at 49.61%.[135]

Polish President Andrzej Duda congratulated Nausėda on his reelection and said he was ""pleased that we'll be able to continue our excellent cooperation"".[136] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expressed his congratulations to Nausėda, citing the latter's support for Ukraine amid the Russian invasion.[137]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Lithuanian_presidential_election
Lithuanian Tatars of the Imperial Guard,"The Lithuanian Tatars of the Imperial Guard (French: Tartares Lituaniens de la Garde Impériale / Lithuanian: Imperatoriškosios Gvardijos Lietuvos totoriai) were a light cavalry squadron of Napoleon's Imperial Guard, in the service of the French Army from 1812 to 1814. The Lipka Tatars, descendants of Crimean Tatars, were organized into a single squadron at the beginning of the Russian Campaign. Their first commander was Squadron Leader Achmatowicz, who was killed at Vilnius and succeeded by Captain Ulan, who led the unit through the remainder of the war. Following the First Abdication of Napoleon, all foreign units were disbanded, and the regiment followed.

The appellation ""Tartars"" was commonly used in the 17th and 18th centuries, but ""Tatars"" has become the common usage in recent times.[1]

During the 14th century, several families from Tatar tribes in Crimea followed Grand Duke Vytautas to Lithuania, where they served as his personal guard at Trakai Island Castle.[2] After the Polish–Lithuanian union in 1385, the Tatars divided and formed communities in several villages.[3]

Unlike the Christian Lithuanian people, the Tatars were Muslims; they were granted religious freedom and were exempt from taxes, but still had to provide military service.[3][4] In the 18th century, after the Partitions of Poland and Lithuania by Russia, Austria, and Prussia, the Tatars fell under Russian rule. Some Tatar volunteers served in the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw after the duchy's creation by Napoleon in 1807.[3]

In June 1812, General Michał Sokolnicki suggested that Napoleon create a regiment of Lithuanian Tatars. He wrote of ""their probity, as well as their courage were experienced […]"".[4] Despite Napoleon's hopes that the unit could comprise up to a thousand soldiers,[4] only enough Tatar volunteers could be found to form a squadron.[5][3] It was composed of 123 men including 1 squadron leader, 1 major, 4 captains, 7 lieutenants and second lieutenants, and 110 non-commissioned officers and soldiers.[3][4] The squadron also had an imam named Aslan Aley, who also served as a second lieutenant.[6][7]

The unit was officially created in October 1812[8][6] and was placed under the command of Colonel Mustapha Murza Achmatowicz, who paid for the squadron's equipment and uniforms.[5][9] The Tatars were attached to the 3rd Lithuanian Lancers Regiment of the Imperial Guard as scouts.[5]

The squadron participated in the 1812 French invasion of Russia with the 6th Brigade of the Imperial Guard Cavalry (Elite Gendarmes, 3rd Lancers and Tatars).[10] They suffered heavy losses during the invasion, particularly at Vilna from 10 to 12 December where Squadron Leader Achmatowicz was killed[11][12] with 34 of his men.[2] The Tatars also participated in the Battle of Kalish on 13 February 1813.[13] The survivors were first incorporated into the remnants of the 3rd Lancers, which had nearly been destroyed at Slonim in October 1812,[14] and then combined with the Polish Lancers of the Imperial Guard where they formed the 15th Company, considered as ""Middle Guard"". By this time, the Lithuanian Tatars were led by Captain Samuel Murza Ulan[15][16] with lieutenants Ibrahim and Aslan Aley as seconds-in-command, with a total strength of only 53 men.[13]

From April to June 1813, on the recommendations of Colonel-Major Dautancourt, the Captain Ulan tried to recruit new cavalrymen and left for France with maréchal des logis-chef Samuel Januszerwski.[7] Reduced to just 47 men, he was refused foreign soldier reinforcements at Metz and went to Paris to seek support from Minister of War Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke. Unsuccessful, Ulan and 24 recruits returned to Friedberg, Germany, the depot of Polish Lancers.[13]

The Lithuanian Tatars continued to serve under Captain Ulan as part of the Polish Lancers during the 1813 German Campaign, participating in battles at Dresden, Peterswalde, Leipzig and Hanau. The Tatars were then transferred to the 3rd Polish Scouts Regiment of the Imperial Guard and saw further losses during the 1814 French Campaign, having 6 killed and 7 taken prisoner.[13] After the abdication of Napoleon on 6 April, Ulan and the few survivors returned to Lithuania.[8] According to Pigeard, 100 men of the initial 123 died by the end of the campaign.[12]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Tatars_of_the_Imperial_Guard
Modestas Paulauskas,"Modestas Paulauskas[note 1] (19 March 1945) is a former Lithuanian professional basketball coach and basketball player.

As a player, he was the youngest EuroBasket MVP in history, being only 20 years old at the time he won the award. He is known for having been one of the best Lithuanian basketball players of all time, and for having excellent dribbling ability. He was selected as the Lithuanian Sportsman of the Year, a record seven times, in 1965–1967, and 1969–1972.[1] He was a member of the Soviet team that achieved Olympic Gold in 1972 in Munich.

In 1991, he was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players.

In 2021, he was included into the FIBA Hall of Fame.[2]

Paulauskas spent his whole club career with Žalgiris Kaunas, despite getting attention from teams based in Western Europe and the National Basketball Association (NBA). He could not join them due to various reasons, one of such is Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union at that time, and it was very hard to travel abroad USSR. The other reason was he never actually wanted to leave his homeland -Lithuania. He was also asked to join Žalgiris Kaunas's main rival, CSKA Moscow, but he declined.[3]

Paulauskas was a part of the senior Soviet Union national basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 1968 Summer Olympic Games, and the gold medal at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games.[4] Paulauskas became the captain of the senior Soviet national team in 1969.[5]

After retiring from playing basketball competitions, Paulauskas worked as a coach of the Soviet Union junior national teams from 1977 to 1989. In the early 1990s, he was the head coach of his native club, Žalgiris Kaunas.[6] After that, he coached basketball in schools, both in Lithuania and in Russia.[7]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modestas_Paulauskas
Statesmen (conspiracy theory),"The Statesmen, or Statesmen Clan (Lithuanian: ""valstybininkai"", ""valstybininkų"" klanas, generally written with quote marks) is a conspiracy theory which claims that a deep state of unelected officials, based in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Security Department of Lithuania (VSD), seeks to influence the actions of elected officials, protect each other in power and take control of Lithuania.[1] The conspiracy theory emerged in 2006, after the death of VSD officer Vytautas Pociūnas in Belarus, who the theory claims was a whistleblower of the clan's activities.[2] The conspiracy theory was promoted by politicians in the Homeland Union (TS-LKD).[1]

Though primarily connected with investigations from 2006 to 2010, the theory has experienced a revival since 2019, after opponents of the Homeland Union claimed that the ""clan"" remains active and is pressuring the Šimonytė Cabinet.[3]

According to Valdas Vasiliauskas, editor-in-chief of Lietuvos žinios (later a Member of the Seimas for the Way of Courage party), the Statesmen are ""a clan-like group of persons connected by constant mutual relations, distribution of roles and tasks among group members"", it is a highly organized and hierarchical organization (Vasiliauskas identified Albinas Januška as its leader), has control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Security Department, the President of Lithuania, the military, police, the political sciences faculty of Vilnius University and is connected with the courts, political parties and the media.[5]

Pociūnas was generally described as a whistleblower, a VSD official who was aware of the conspiracy and was killed for attempting to reveal it to the media. The specific information differed. In 2008, Vasiliauskas claimed that Pociūnas investigated the connections between the ""Statesmen"" and the energy company Dujotekana, as well as the company's influence in government institutions.[5] Later, in 2014, he claimed that Pociūnas was aware about the CIA black site in Antaviliai, near Vilnius, and the alleged bribes to VSD officials which allowed its creation.[6]

It had been alleged that the ""Statesmen"" were responsible for the fall of Brazauskas Cabinet II and convinced members of the Labour Party to support the formation of the Kirkilas Cabinet.[1] Viktor Uspaskich accused ""statesmen"" of attempting to destroy his political career and his party via Labour's ""dark accounting"" case.[7] Rolandas Paksas, President of Lithuania impeached in 2004, claimed that he opposed the ""statesmen"" during his presidency and was removed for refusing to allow the establishment of the Antaviliai CIA black site.[8] In 2007, he claimed that ""statesmen"" conspired to raise attention towards LGBT rights in Lithuania to distract attention from their case.[9]

According to Rasa Juknevičienė, Member of the Seimas from the Homeland Union, the deep state emerged after the 1998 Russian financial crisis and the 2000 Lithuanian parliamentary election, which spurned a group of individuals to ""take the reins of the state to their hands"" with Russian financial support.[10] Vasiliauskas claimed that the conspiracy formed as early as 1990, within the deputies of the Supreme Council of Lithuania, also known as the Reconstituent Seimas, including members of the former Communist Party of Lithuania.[5] Antanas Valionis claimed that ""TS-LKD campaign against the so-called Statesmen"" could have been motivated by the struggles of business groups in the energy sector in 2000–2006 and VSD investigations into previous unexplained violent acts, such as the Bražuolė bridge bombing in 1994 and the bombing of the editorial office of Lietuvos rytas in 1995. According to the politician, the TS-LKD interpreted this as a conspiracy against them.[11]

Though the pejorative term ""valstybininkas"" (""Statesman"", meaning an official who belongs to a group of influential figures seeking personal gain) has been used in Lithuanian media since at least 2005,[12] the conspiracy theory emerged after Vytautas Pociūnas, a VSD officer stationed in Brest, Belarus, was found dead after falling out of the window of Hotel Intourist on 23 August 2006.[13] The death was ruled an accident, but it was rumoured that Pociūnas was killed for his alleged investigations into a deep state within the Lithuanian government and institutions, and their anti-state activities.[2] It became more prominent after an investigation into Pociūnas' death by the State Prosecutor's Office was closed in late 2006 after a very quick investigation (including a claim that Pociūnas fell out of a window while urinating, which was interpreted as a smear campaign),[14] and after an Ekstra magazine interview of VSD deputy director Darius Jurgelevičius in September 2006, in which he commented on the public interest in the Pociūnas case:

There are many nuances and details. And if all this rummaging around in those bones continues, moments that will not add honor to the whole thing will start to emerge. I think someone is trying to make a big show, but the result, I believe, will be disappointing. Unfortunate.[15]

Numerous protests were held in support of Pociūnas and his surviving family, and the final annual commemoration of his death was held in 2016.[16] The death was also followed by an investigation by the Seimas National Security and Defense Committee (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos Seimo nacionalinio saugumo ir gynybos komitetas, NSGK) into VSD activity, initiated by Homeland Union Member of the Seimas Rasa Juknevičienė.[17]

On 4 December 2006, NSGK published their conclusion on the activities of the State Security Department. 33 active (in December 2006) and 4 former VSD officials, Seimas members Andrius Kubilius, Jurgis Razma, Antanas Valionis, former secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Albinas Januška, former Director General of VSD, ambassador to Spain Mečys Laurinkus, consul general in Grodno Daiva Mockuvienė, television journalist Joana Lapėnienė, Vytautas Pociūnas's wife Liudvika Pociūnienė and brother Algimantas Pociūnas, and signatory of the Act of March 11 Algirdas Endriukaitis testified before the committee.[18]

The investigation was controversial. Januška resigned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claiming that he is unable to answer public criticism while keeping state secrets, but was immediately reappointed as advisor to Gediminas Kirkilas. NSGK members unsuccessfully demanded certificates from the VSD related to possible corrupt connections of high-ranking officials. Refused, the politicians turned to President Valdas Adamkus hoping to convince him to temporarily suspend the then head of the VSD, Arvydas Pocius, whose decision not to provide information was assessed as a mockery of the Seimas. However, the president refused to meet with members of the Seimas. During the investigation, independent journalists published information regarding the suspects' alleged membership in the KGB and connections with the Russian state energy company Gazprom.[1]

In the committee's opinion, Pociūnas was removed from his previous duties within the VSD and assigned to Belarus in order to stop corruption investigations he was conducting in the transport and energy sectors. In addition, the committee stated that

certain signs identified during the parliamentary investigation allow to assume that some VSD investigations, actions of directors and officials in some cases may have been carried out or their results used for the benefit of certain political groups, in other cases - to influence these political groups or politicians themselves.[18][19]

The committee's opinion statement first coined the term ""statesman"" to refer to individuals allegedly involved, to Albinas Januška, without a negative connotation.[20]

The term ""statesmen"" was originally claimed by the accused politicians and civil servants themselves, to express their patriotism. Mečys Laurinkus commented on the existence of a group which ""formulated tasks"" for the State Security Department on 30 October 2007:

In many democratic states, there is a mechanism for forming tasks for the intelligence service and even reviewing them annually. These are special groups of politicians in the government or presidency. There is no such mechanism in Lithuania, the VSD works according to the Law on the Fundamentals of National Security, like a radar signaling an impending threat.
It is effective, but very expensive, and it also duplicates the work of other services. Several influential Lithuanian politicians, who are quite rightly called by the honorable name of ""statesmen"", took the initiative of formulating tasks. Unusual, new, but very necessary work has received distorted evaluations from both inside and outside the institution.[21]

This was taken by various politicians in the country to be a confirmation of the existence of the conspiracy, and Member of the Seimas Algimantas Matulevičius (Civic Democracy Party), in charge of a parliamentary investigation into VSD activity, described it as an unconstitutional act. Laurinkus later claimed that he does not remember the existence of such a scandal.[22]

Vytautas Pociūnas' widow, Liudvika Pociūnienė, requested the reopening of the terminated investigation in November 2006, claiming that it lacked detail and was not impartial. She was joined by Member of the Seimas Saulius Pečeliūnas (TS-LKD), who formed a nonpartisan civil society organization, Rally of Citizens (Lithuanian: Piliečių santalka), claiming to combat perceived cliques in the government and a ""nomenklatura more powerful than the law"".[23] Both complaints were dismissed by the General Prosecutor's Office in July 2007 on lacking grounds.[24]

Pociūnienė received support throughout the political spectrum. Vytautas Landsbergis, former leader of the Homeland Union, asserted that the conclusions of the prosecutor's office that Pociūnas died in an accident were ""worthless"", and the New Union (Social Liberals) lodged a demand that the General Prosecutor's Office should make the materials of the investigation file public.[25] On 17 August 2007, Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas announced the formation of a special work committee which would investigate the circumstances of Pociūnas' death, led by publicist Vytautas Ališauskas and staffed by Seimas and European Parliament members from several political parties.[26] New forensic and medical experts were hired after Pociūnas' widow and the press criticized the negligence of the forensic experts during the initial investigation.

The renewed investigation was slow and controversial. It was criticized by President Valdas Adamkus as a threat to the independence of the prosecution system.[27] The committee could only meet in 2008 due to conflicting schedules of the committee members (including two EP members, who worked in Brussels and could only participate on Fridays), and several of the committee's members resigned before the first meeting due to this inactivity.[28] Meanwhile, at the order of court, the General Prosecutor's Office renewed investigation into the case, which doubled the work of the committee. It was shut down in March 2008.[29] An independent investigation commission was organized by Sąjūdis in July 2008.[30] Vygaudas Ušackas alleged that asking for Landsbergis's support to be selected as Minister of Foreign Affairs in October 2008, he was requested to ""eliminate the Statesmen element administered by Albinas Januška"".[31]

On 24 February 2009, the case was closed again and the General Prosecutor's Office reaffirmed that Pociūnas' death was an accident. Liudvika Pociūnienė once again protested the verdict.[30] On 9 June 2009, the Vilnius District Court ordered the prosecutors to reopen the case a third time.[32] Under court order, the case was also reclassified as a murder case. After investigations into official documents, over 100 witnesses questioned and experiments organized in the Inturist hotel in Brest, the case was closed as an accident again on 1 February 2013.[33] Pociūnienė requested the case to be reopened again, but her request was dismissed.[34]

On 26 March 2008, an article titled ""Lithuania Has Been Taken Over by the Statesmen Clan?"" (Lithuanian: ""Lietuvą užvaldė „valstybininkų"" klanas?"") was published on the newspaper Lietuvos žinios. This article compiled a list of 43 civil servants, diplomats, advisors of then-president Valdas Adamkus, VSD employees, businessmen, political scientists, and members of the Seimas, who were allegedly members of a single hierarchical structured ""clan"" which seeks to take over the state.[5] According to editor-in-chief Valdas Vasiliauskas, it was published under a pseudonym to ""protect the author from possible retaliation"".[35]

In the same month, Mečys Laurinkus published an open letter for Vytautas Landsbergis, requesting him to use his authority to end ""the idiotic persecution of some civil servants that has been going on for almost two years now"". Laurinkus also asked the leadership of TS-LKD to mention a single crime committed by the alleged ""statesmen"".[36]

An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the formation of the Kirkilas Cabinet was proposed in the Seimas in 2008, but was voted down.[1] Discussion of the ""List of Statesmen"" and the high point of the conspiracy theory coincided with the 2008 Lithuanian parliamentary election, which was seen as an opportunity for ""De-Albinization"".[37] Several parties vowed to destroy the conspiracy's perceived power in their electoral campaigns. Opponents of the perceived ""statesmen"" described themselves as ""patriots"" (Lithuanian: ""pilietininkai"").[38] Both sides alleged that the other side was influenced or controlled by corporations and foreign interests - ""statesmen"" referred to the holding company MG Baltic and chemical company Achema, while ""patriots"" referred to Dujotekana and the business alliance ""VP Ten"", led by Nerijus Numavičius. Both sides accused the other of collusion with Russia.[39]

The election was won by the Homeland Union, which was joined by the Liberal and Centre Union, the National Resurrection Party and the Liberal Movement in a centre-right ""Coalition for Change"" (Lithuanian: Permainų koalicija), which formed the Kubilius Cabinet II.[40]

In November 2008, VSD director Povilas Malakauskas informed the newly appointed Homeland Union prime minister Andrius Kubilius of the existence of an alleged anti-state group called ""Hawks"" (Lithuanian: ""vanagai"").[41] ""Hawks"" were journalists and politicians affiliated with the political right who were actively involved in the alleged ""unmasking"" of ""statesmen"" activity. Valdas Vasiliauskas, journalist Tomas Čyvas, Darius Kuolys (later founder of the Lithuanian List), Audrius Bačiulis, Virgis Valentinavičius (advisor of Andrius Kubilius), Vladas Laučius (chief editor of news portal Alfa.lt, previously consultant for MG Baltic Media) and others were alleged as members of this counter-conspiracy.[42] Alleged members of this group claimed that this was a VSD attempt to control the media and influence politicians.[43]

Edvardas Čiuldė claimed that ""hawks"" represented the interests of large media companies and were financed by the alcohol producer Stumbras, owned by MG Baltic.[44]

Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of Lithuania from 2009 to 2019, won the 2009 Lithuanian presidential election with an anti-systemic platform and was supported by the Homeland Union.[45] After her inauguration, several state officials implicated in the conspiracy theory were removed from office. In August 2009, in a controversial decree, she fired deputy director of the VSD Darius Jurgelevičius, while Mečys Laurinkus was accused of politicking in diplomatic service and recalled from the Lithuanian embassy in Georgia in late 2009.[1] Valdas Vasiliauskas described it as ""a war between the President and the Statesmen"".[46]

Albinas Januška retired from politics in late 2008 to herd sheep in a farm near Zarasai, but continued to unofficially advise politicians on state affairs.[47]

By late 2010, the Homeland Union dropped their interest in the ""statesmen"" conspiracy theory and ceased investigations in government institutions such as the VSD,[48] although it was still maintained by independent ""hawk"" journalists,[43] the Civic Democracy Party[49] and the Way of Courage party.[50]

According to declassified VSD information, officials allegedly a part of the ""Statesmen"" group (including Albinas Januška and Raimondas Lopata) attempted to appoint Mindaugas Bastys as Minister of Agriculture in the Butkevičius Cabinet in 2012.[51]

In early 2023, the conspiracy theory was revived after the publication of the book ""The Whistleblower and the President"" (Lithuanian: Pranešėjas ir prezidentas) by Dovydas Pancerovas and Birutė Davidonytė, which described alleged business and VSD involvement in the Gitanas Nausėda campaign during the 2019 Lithuanian presidential election, including illegal collection of personal information. After the publication of the book, MPs of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union alleged that the book was published to discredit the incumbent president and proposed an investigation into ""statesmen"" activity,[52] but the proposal did not find support even among the opposition.[2]

In January 2024, Gitanas Nausėda's chief advisor Frederikas Jansonas claimed that appointments to vacant ambassador positions are delayed due to ""statesmen"" sabotage, and alleged that the conspiracy group is allied with the Šimonytė Cabinet. He identified members of the government, such as Žygimantas Pavilionis, as individuals listed in the 2008 ""List of the Statesmen"".[53] Albinas Januška dismissed the allegations.[54]

Proponents of the conspiracy theory generally refer to individuals named in the ""List of the Statesmen"" (Lithuanian: ""valstybininkų"" sąrašas), which lists the alleged deep state's members and supporters.[55] The list was originally published by the newspaper Lietuvos žinios on 26 March 2008:[5]

The newspaper also claimed that other, unmentioned figures are affiliated with the conspiracy within political parties, in the legal system and in business.[5]

The Statesmen conspiracy theory was pronounced during the 2008 Lithuanian parliamentary election. In their 2008 election programs, the Civic Democracy Party vowed to ""destroy the ""statesmen clan"""", and Order and Justice claimed that they ""seek power in order to restore the state to the people, which they were robbed by the ""statesmen"" clan"".[56] The conspiracy was also frequently referred to by politicians of the Homeland Union, such as Rasa Juknevičienė, as well as President Dalia Grybauskaitė, who connected it with Russian influence in the Lithuanian government.[10]

During Kubilius Cabinet II, the death of Vytautas Pociūnas was brought up by Conservative politicians, such as Jurgis Razma, as waving the bloody shirt to support reforms to the State Security Department and the dissolution of the national energy company LEO LT.[57]

The Statesmen conspiracy theory emerged at a similar time as the Case of Drąsius Kedys, another controversial legal case which led to public protest against perceived corruption and ""clans"" in the state apparatus. According to controversial journalist and TV presenter Rūta Janutienė, in both cases, ""the victim is turned into the culprit of the accident, labels of alcoholics and drug addicts are attached to the deceased"".[58] Tomas Čyvas claimed that state security services connected to the conspiracy were responsible for separating Drąsius Kedys and his daughter.[41] Similarly, the investigation into the unexplained assassination of VSD officer Juras Abromavičius took place in 2007, and some journalists and conspiracy theorists stated that they were committed by the same ""mafia clan"".[59]

Vytautas Pociūnas' widow, Liudvika Pociūnienė, became a member of TS-LKD and was elected as a Member of the Seimas in the 2020 Lithuanian parliamentary election.[60]

A 2006 November file on the resignation of Albinas Januška by the United States embassy in Lithuania was leaked from a document cache by WikiLeaks. In it, US officials express their surprise at Januška's resignation, mention his influence in the Kirkilas Cabinet and state theories about his resignation by questioned Lithuanian officials, including possible Russian involvement. According to the document,

Whenever a prominent official in Lithuania becomes the victim of a scandal, it is usual to blame Russia. We may never know why this mysterious official resigned. What still confuses us is that A. Januska resigned because of such hard-to-prove and unfounded accusations. For all we know, he could have overcome this situation if he had wanted to. However, we believe that this Svengali of Lithuania will remain active and influential in the circles of Lithuanian domestic and foreign politics in the future.[61]

A previously unnamed street in the Pilaitė district in Vilnius was named Vytautas Pociūnas Street in 2016.[62]

The conspiracy theory was parodied on the Lithuanian political satire TV show Dviračio žinios.[63]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statesmen_(conspiracy_theory)
Office of the Chief Archivist of Lithuania,"The Office of the Chief Archivist of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Vyriausiojo Archyvaro Tarnyba) is a government agency in Lithuania, which participates in the shaping of national policy in the field of management and use of documents and archives, as well as implements this policy, supports the Chief Archivist of Lithuania in the carrying-out of state administration of the field of documents and archives.

The emergence of archives in Lithuania is associated with the formation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the first half of the 13th century. The old Lithuanian chancery archives of Grand Duke and King Mindaugas did not survive: they were destroyed by numerous wars and fires. The Grand Duke's chancery archives later acquired the title of the Lithuanian Metrica. In the Middle Ages archives of towns, churches and estates were formed. When the Russian Empire occupied Lithuania in 1795, the most important Lithuanian archives were transferred to Russia.

It was in middle of the 19th century the first archives was established as a special institution for accumulating and preserving records. The year 1852 saw the establishment of the Vilnius Central Archives of Early Register Books, the purpose of which was to preserve official files of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Records from the period of the Russian invasion (19th–20th centuries), belonging to Tsarist Russian institutions of the Vilna Governorate, were stored in the Joint Archives of Vilnius Institutions established in 1872–76.

After the declaration of the independent Republic of Lithuania, the Central State Archives were established in Kaunas on 19 October 1921. The purpose of these archives was to collect and preserve all records of former state and local government institutions, take care of archives belonging to private persons, and accommodate archival records recovered from Russia.

Following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in 1940, the country's institutions were dismantled and replaced with the new Soviet authorities. On August 5, 1940 the new Council of Ministers laid the responsibility for archives management and preservation with the ministry of the Interior.[1] In 1961 the Archival Board under the Council of Ministers of the LSSR was established. In 1957–68, the basis was laid to the network of state archives consisting of central and regional archives. During the occupation between 1940 and 1990, the Lithuanian archives made some notable progress in recovery of a number of archival records from other countries as well as general development of a sound state archival system.[2]

After the Lithuanian independence was reestablished on 11 March 1990, the modern system of state archives was formed.

At present, the state archival system consists of Office of the Chief Archivist of Lithuania as the central institution and 15 state archives subordinate to it, of which there are 10 archives for each county and 5 specialised archives:[3][4]

The National Documentary Fonds consists of activity documents of state and municipal institutions, agencies and enterprises, persons authorised by the state, activity documents of state agencies and enterprises which operated in Lithuania at various times, as well as the documents preserved in state archives. Activity documents of enduring value of non-governmental organisations, private legal and natural persons, as well as the documents of the historical heritage of Lithuania or related to Lithuania, or their copies, received from other states may be included to the National Documentary Fonds.

Today, state archives play an important role in the processes of preserving and using public records of the Lithuanian National Documentary Fonds, making them accessible to the citizens and governmental and public institutions, creating efficient information search systems, providing public services.[5]

The state archives service plays an important role in the processes of records management in the public sector, for the transparency and accountability of public administration. State archives provide records on approximately 2,000 institutions and agencies.[5]

Today the functions of the Office of the Chief Archivist of Lithuania are defined in Law of archives of Republic of Lithuania.[6]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Chief_Archivist_of_Lithuania

2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election,"The 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election was held on 13 and 27 October 2024 to elect the 141 members of the Seimas. Parliament members were elected in 71 single-member constituencies using the two-round system, and the remaining 70 in a single nationwide constituency using proportional representation. The first round was held on 13 October and the second round on 27 October.[1][2][3]

The elections were won by the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP),[4] which secured 19.32% of the popular vote and 52 seats, up from 9.58% and 13 seats in the previous elections in 2020. The Homeland Union (TS–LKD), the largest party in the ruling centre-right coalition in the preceding Seimas, finished a distant second, securing 28 seats, down from its previous 50.

Following the first round of the election, the Social Democrats entered into coalition talks with the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (LVŽS) and the Union of Democrats ""For Lithuania"" (DSVL), which had split from the latter. After the second round, the consultations were expanded to include the Liberals' Movement (LS), which had been part of the outgoing conservative-led coalition, and Dawn of Nemunas (PPNA), a new nationalist party that finished in third place overall.[5]

The LSDP eventually reached a deal with DSVL and PPNA to form a coalition government.[6] The Social Democrats' decision to include the Dawn of Nemunas party, whose founder is known for making controversial statements, prompted domestic and international backlash.[7][8]

The 2020 election was won by the Homeland Union, which formed a coalition with the Liberal Movement and Freedom Party. The Šimonytė Cabinet was appointed by President Gitanas Nausėda on 7 December 2020, after the Seimas approved Ingrida Šimonytė as Prime Minister.[9] On 11 December, the Government program was approved, thus the cabinet officially took office.[10] Major domestic and foreign events during the term include the COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania, 2020–2021 Belarusian protests and the Belarus–European Union border crisis and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The 2023 Lithuanian municipal elections were won by the opposition Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, with the Homeland Union at second place, and the Homeland Union candidate Ingrida Šimonytė was defeated by incumbent Gitanas Nausėda in the 2024 Lithuanian presidential election with the largest share of the vote in the history of presidential elections in Lithuania. However, the Homeland Union finished at first place in the 2024 European Parliament election in Lithuania, with the Social Democrats at second place. The Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union, which was the largest party in the Seimas prior to the 2020 parliamentary election, split, with the defectors forming the Union of Democrats ""For Lithuania"", and finished third in the 2023 municipal and the 2024 European Parliament elections.

Other notable changes in the political landscape since 2020 included the establishment of Dawn of Nemunas, led by presidential candidate Remigijus Žemaitaitis after his expulsion from Freedom and Justice due to his antisemitic statements, which grew in popularity after the 2024 presidential election, as well as the poor performance of the Labour Party, which failed to win a deputy in the European Parliament for the first time since its establishment in 2003, and which was subsequently abandoned by several of the party's members of parliament, which led to the collapse of the party's parliamentary group.[11]

There were 1740 candidates running for seats in the parliament, including 8 mayors, 4 MEPs and 128 current members of the Seimas.[12] Additionally, 700 politicians vied for seats in 71 single-mandate constituencies.[12]

Half of the seats in the 141-member parliament are allocated to at-large party lists that will clear the 5-percent threshold.[12]

After passing amendment of Constitution's article № 56 in April 2022, to be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 21 years old on the election day, not under allegiance to a foreign state and permanently reside in Lithuania,[13] while previously, candidates needed to be at least 25 years old on the election day. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not run for election.[14] In addition, a person who has been removed from office through impeachment may be elected after 10 year period after impeachment.[15][16]

The Electoral Code was adopted on 23 June 2022. The Code replaced various electoral acts and introduced several changes to the parliamentary elections. It allowed the establishment more than one overseas constituency and removed a ban of political parties' campaigning on Saturdays (e. g. one day prior to the election).[17] The Electoral Code introduced changes for members to be elected in single-member constituencies. Prior to change, leading candidates needed to obtain over 50 per cent of all votes (including invalid ballots) to be elected in the first round. After the change, leading candidates needed to obtain just over 20 per cent of votes from all registered voters in a particular single-member constituency.[18]

In 2023, single-member constituencies were redrawn. Most boundary changes happened in Klaipėda, Kaunas, Vilnius and their suburbs.[19][20]

LLRA–KŠS accused some boundary changes as being an attempt of ""artificial dilution of the minority electorate"".[21]

The Seimas has 141 members, elected to a four-year term in parallel voting, with 71 members elected in single-seat constituencies using the two-round system and 70 members elected by proportional representation.[14] The voting in the elections is open to all citizens of Lithuania who are at least 18 years old.

Parliament members in the 71 single-seat constituencies are elected in a majority vote; or per a new provision instituted in 2022, a leading candidate in a constituency is directly elected if they receive the support of one fifth of registered voters.[22] A run-off is held within 15 days, if necessary. The remaining 70 seats are allocated to the participating political parties using the largest remainder method. Parties normally need to receive at least 5% (7% for multi-party electoral lists) of the votes to be eligible for a seat. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election and adjusted by preference votes given by the voters.[14]

For the 2024 election, around 2.4 million people were eligible to vote.[23]

On 9 April 2024 the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, officially announced 13 October 2024 as the election date. The announcement launched the election campaign, allowing the potential participants to register for the elections, raise funds and campaign in public.[24]

The following is a list of parties which are registered as participants in the election by the Central Election Commission. 23 political parties were eligible to participate in the elections, having submitted their membership rolls before 10 April 2024, in compliance with legal requirements. 20 political parties registered for the elections before the deadline on 22 July 2024. [25] Three parties, Together with the Vytis, Movement for Forests – Young Lithuania and Christian Union, withdrew from the race on their own accord.[26][27][28] On 9 August 2024, 15 different electoral lists were registered. 1,740 candidates participated in the elections: 1,089 men and 651 women.[29]

Party representives drew their ballot numbers in a ceremony in Seimas Palace on 19 August 2024. Number of the People and Justice Union was drawn by the representative of the CEC, due to members failure to participate in the event.[30]

The Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT hosted six televised debate shows, organized together with the Central Electoral Commission (CEC). According to the CEC these were to be divided into two rounds of three debate shows.[46] Each debate included five parties (or electoral lists), and was broadcast on TV and online starting at 9:00 PM. The moderators were LRT journalists Deividas Jursevičius, Rasa Tapinienė [lt], and Nemira Pumprickaitė [lt].[47]

Seven radio debates, hosted by LRT Radijas, were organized along similar lines. Each radio debate included representatives of two or three parties, and was broadcast on FM radio and the LRT website starting at 9:05 AM.[46][47]

Four radio debates dedicated specifically to cultural issues were hosted by LRT Klasika starting at 11:05 AM. Representatives from three or four parties were invited to participate in each of these debates.[46][47]

Furthermore, the youth initiative ""Žinau, ką renku"" (lit. 'I know who I'm voting for') hosted a live debate in cooperation with LRT, which was held on 11 October at 8:00 PM in the courtyard of Lukiškės Prison. All of the leaders of the 15 parties were invited.[47] This youth initiative also hosted individual debates for all 71 single-seat constituencies, which were broadcast on the LRT website.[47]

After the first round of voting on 13 October, 63 of the 71 single-member constituencies remained contested between the top two candidates. Prior to the run-off elections on 27 October to determine the final winners, debates between the run-off candidates were filmed for each of these 63 districts and broadcast on the 15min, TV3, Delfi and Lrytas news portals, as well as the website rinkimai2024.lt. These debates were filmed from 16 to 21 October in the studios of Delfi and Laisvės TV [lt].[48]

Nine incumbent members of Seimas chose to not run in the elections:[49]

Parliamentary election poll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each poll is displayed in bold, and its background is shaded in the leading party's colour. The ""Lead"" column shows the percentage point difference between the two parties with the highest figures.

The results of the first round were confirmed on 20 October 2024.[50]

Early voting was held from 8–12 October, with turnout recorded at 11.75%.[51] Final turnout following the first round was at 52.2%, an increase from the 47.2% recorded in 2020.[52][53]

Alongside votes for a party, voters were able to cast a preferential votes for a candidate on the party list.

On the night of 14 October, Vilija Blinkevičiūtė and Saulius Skvernelis, the leaders of the LSDP and the DSVL respectively, agreed to cooperate in the second round and to form a coalition government afterwards.[60] LVŽS joined the agreement on 15 October.[61] Despite the LSDP ruling out coalition with the PPNA,[62] the latter party pledged to support Blinkevičiūtė becoming prime minister.[63]

On 30 October, Blinkevičiūtė confirmed that she will not be prime minister and will continue to work as a member of the European Parliament, citing her age and health. Gintautas Paluckas became a candidate for prime minister.[56]

On 7 November, the LSDP invited the DSVL and Dawn of Nemunas to form a ruling coalition, which would encompass 86 of the 141 seats in the Seimas.[64] The inclusion of the Dawn of Nemunas party immediately provoked strong negative reactions both domestically and abroad. On 8 November, over 30 non-governmental organizations based in Lithuania signed an open letter against the decision, fearing a negative impact on human rights, democracy and national security,[7][65] and US Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair Ben Cardin released a statement condemning the move.[66][67] The same day, the New York Times also published a story about Dawn of Nemunas, focusing on Žemaitaitis' antisemitic statements.[68][69] Further criticism came from German MPs Michael Roth (chair of the foreign affairs committee) and Roderich Kiesewetter (representative of the main opposition in the same committee),[70] Polish senator Michał Kamiński,[71] and the Israeli embassy.[72]

On 9 November, Žemaitaitis claimed that the foreign reactions were instigated by his political opponents,[73] and Paluckas similarly attributed them to opposing politicians' international connections.[74] Paluckas stated that Žemaitaitis himself would not be offered a cabinet position.[75] On 19 November, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda nominated Paluckas for prime minister.[76] His appointment was confirmed by the Seimas on 21 November, having received 84 votes against 36 negative votes and six abstentions.[77]

On the day after the second round of the election, Gabrielius Landsbergis announced his resignation as leader of the Homeland Union and as member of the next Seimas. He endorsed Ingrida Šimonytė, the outgoing Prime Minister, for the party leadership. Landsbergis also lost in the Centras-Žaliakalnis single-member constituency, which he represented since 2016, to Simonas Kairys of the Liberals' Movement and fellow member of the Šimonytė Cabinet.[57] Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė became interim leader of the party.[78]

After the second round of the election, various parties lost all their seats in the Seimas, including the Labour Party and the Lithuanian Regions Party. On the other hand, the LSDP won 52 seats, its best ever result. It also won single-member constituencies in Kaunas for the first time since 1992.[79]

On 3 November, Aušrinė Armonaitė announced her resignation as leader of the Freedom Party after it failed to win any seats.[80] On 6 November, Jonas Pinskus of the Lithuanian Regions Party also resigned.[81]

Due to the election of Rimantas Sinkevičius, the council of the Jonava District Municipality would have to find a second mayor pro tempore to serve the position until the March 2025 special mayoral election to replace removed Mayor (and son of Rimantas Sinkevičius) Mindaugas Sinkevičius.[82]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Lithuanian_parliamentary_election
Vilna Governorate-General,"Vilna Governorate-General (Russian: Литовское генерал-губернаторство, Lithuanian: Vilniaus generalgubernatorija), known as Lithuania Governorate-General before 1830, was a Governorate-General of the Russian Empire from 1794 to 1912. It primarily encompassed the Vilna, Grodno, and Kovno Governorates. Governors General were also commanders of the Vilna Military District. According to the Russian Empire Census, the Governorate-General had 4,754,000 residents in 1897.[1]

The Governorate-General was established in November 1794 when territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were incorporated into the Russian Empire following the Third Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The core of the Governorate-General was the present-day territory of Lithuania and western Belarus. In 1794–1797, the Governorate-General was composed of two governorates, Vilna Governorate and Slonim Governorate, which were merged into the Lithuania Governorate by Paul I of Russia. After his assassination, the governorate was again divided into Vilna and Grodno Governorates. In 1834, Kovno Governorate was formed from the seven western powiats of the Vilna Governorate.[1]

The Governorate-General temporarily included other territories as well:[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Governorate-General

Wooden synagogues in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,"Wooden synagogues are an original style of vernacular synagogue architecture that emerged in the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[1][2] The style developed between the mid-16th and mid-17th centuries, a period of peace and prosperity for the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish community. While many were destroyed during the First and Second World Wars, there are some that survive today in Lithuania.

According to Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka, wooden synagogues in Poland–Lithuania developed during the Renaissance, sometime from the mid-16th to mid-17th century. This period was described as a time of peace and prosperity for the Jewish community of the vast Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which at its peak occupied much of Central and Eastern Europe. The style was particularly common in the eastern territories of the Commonwealth which now constitute Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. Moreover, such synagogues were predominantly found in smaller townships, villages and shtetls rather than larger cities.[3]

Timber was abundant and inexpensive in the heavily forested Commonwealth, but a large part of the motivation for building in wood rather than stone or brick was the great difficulty of obtaining government permission to erect masonry synagogues.[4] The wooden synagogues, which featured multi-layered high roofs, multi-beamed domes, galleries, wooden balconies and arches were built to high standards of craftsmanship.[5]

The synagogues fell victim to obsolescence and neglect over the next centuries. During the Second World War, the Germans burned and destroyed nearly all of the wooden synagogues that were still standing. None remain in Poland today, however, some did survive in Lithuania.[6]

The wooden synagogue was ""an original architectural genre"" that drew on several models, including Poland's wooden building traditions and central plan, masonry synagogues in which four massive masonry pillars that define the Bimah rise to support the roof vaulting.[7] Central pillars support the vaulting of only a handful of wooden synagogues. Instead, in wooden synagogues the vaulting and domes are suspended by elaborate roof trusses. Common features shared by wooden synagogues include the independence of the pitched roof from the design of the interior domed ceiling. The outside of a wooden synagogue gave no hint of the domes and multiple, Baroque vaults that would be found within. The exteriors were decidedly plain, giving no hint of the riot of carving, painting, domes, balconies and vaulting inside. The architectural interest of the exterior lay in the large scale of the buildings, the multiple, horizontal lines of the tiered roofs, and the carved corbels that supported them. The elaborate domed and vaulted ceilings were known as raki'a (Hebrew for sky or firmament) and were often painted blue sprinkled with stars. The Bimah was always placed in the center of the room. Wooden synagogues featured a single, large hall. In contrast to contemporary churches, there was no apse. Moreover, while contemporary churches featured imposing vestibules, the entry porches of the wooden synagogues was a low annex, usually with a simple lean-to roof. In these synagogues, the emphasis was on constructing a single, large, high-domed worship space.[1][2][7][8]

According to art historian Stephen S. Kayser, the wooden synagogues of Poland with their painted and carved interiors were ""a truly original and organic manifestation of artistic expression—the only real Jewish folk art in history"".[9]

According to Louis Lozowick, writing in 1947, the wooden synagogues were unique because, unlike all previous synagogues, they were not built in the architectural style of their region and era, but in a newly evolved and uniquely Jewish style, making them ""a truly original folk expression"", whose ""originality does not lie alone in the exterior architecture, it lies equally in the beautiful and intricate wood carving of the interior"".[10]

Moreover, while in many parts of the world Jews were proscribed from entering the building trades and even from practicing the decorative arts of painting and woodcarving, the wooden synagogues were actually built by Jewish craftsmen.[11] Other research points to certain synagogues being made by Christian master builders. For example, the early history of the Gwoździec Synagogue is unknown and portions of the structure date back to 1650. The original structure was built in a regional style exhibiting both Jewish and Polish vernacular architecture. In the 18th century there was a dramatic reconfiguration of the prayer hall ceiling. It is believed to be the first cupola of its kind. The timber framers are unknown but presumed to be Christian master builders since until the 19th century Jews were excluded from the trade. The liturgical paintings were made by Jewish artists. Isaac, son of Rabbi Judah Leib ha Cohen and Israel, son of Rabbi Mordecai, have inscribed their names on the paintings in the western ceiling.[12][13]

The interior vaulting of the Wolpa Synagogue is described by art historians Maria and Kazimierz Piechotka as having been ""the most magnificent of all known wooden ceilings"" in Europe.[14] Of course, since Christians were free to build with brick and stone, few European buildings of the scale of the Wolpa synagogue were ever built in wood. The walls of the main hall were 7.2 meters high. The vaulting, under a three-tiered roof, rose to a height of fourteen meters in three tiers marked by fancy balustrades. Each tier was made up of several curving sections faced in wooden paneling to form a graceful, tiered and vaulted dome. The vaulted ceiling was supported by the four wooden corner columns that rose form the bimah, and by trusses in the roof.[15]

Art historian Ori Z. Soltes points out that the wooden synagogues, unusual for that period in being large, identifiably Jewish buildings not hidden in courtyards or behind walls, were built not only during a Jewish ""intellectual golden age"" but in a time and place where ""the local Jewish population was equal to or even greater than the Christian population"".[16]

Wooden synagogues can be divided into three types by the plan of the building, according to an article by G.K. Lukomski.[17]

Wooden synagogues may also be divided into three groups according to the shape of the roof and the number of cornices which divide them into stages (of the Mansard type, called in Polish ""podcienie""), i.e., roofs with one, two or three stages.[17]

Examples: synagogue at Lanckorona in Podolie; Polaniec; Pareczow; Orsza; Szkloff; Radoszyce; Pilica; Nowogradek; Przedborz; Zydaczew; Brzozdowice; Pieczenierzyn; Jablonow.

Examples: Gwozdziec; Grodno; Chodorow; Uzlany (Usljany); Kamyenyets; Nasielsk; Njaswisch; Mogilev.

Examples: Nowe-Miasto; Pohrebyszcze; Jedwabne; Narowla; Wolpa; Zabłudów.

The interiors were decorated with wall and ceiling paintings that, in many cases, covered the walls and ceilings entirely, and with elaborately carved wooden Torah arks.[7][8][5]

Thomas Hubka has traced the style of decorative painting in the wooden synagogues to the medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts of Ashkenazi Jewry.[18]

The intricate wooden decoration of the barrel vaulted ceiling of the Przedbórz Synagogue was considered so beautiful that before the Second World War it drew tourists to the small village of Przedbórz.[19]

Architectural historian Rachel Wischnitzer has traced regional variations in wooden synagogue style. The interiors of the wooden synagogues of Lithuania were not as exuberantly painted as were synagogues of other regions. Instead, Lithuanian synagogues were notable for architectural details such as ceilings with the boards laid in decorative herringbone patterns. Several Lithuanian synagogues featured corner pavilions. The wooden synagogues of Galicia were notable for their elaborate wall paintings.[1]

Wooden synagogues were quite abundant, and several famous authors and artists include them in their works.

Adam Mickiewicz gives detailed description of wooden synagogues in his epic poem Pan Tadeusz, Or, the Last Foray in Lithuania; a Story of Life Among Polish Gentlefolk in the Years 1811 and 1812, first published in 1834.

The new inn made an uninspired impression; 
The old one had been built in ancient fashion 
Dreamed up by the carpenters of Tyre, and then 
Spread through the world by the Jews—a style unknown 
To architects in any other place. 
The Jews it was who brought it here to us. 
It's shaped like a ship in front, a temple behind; 
The ship part is a Noah's Ark on land, 
Or, as the vulgar say, a barn—a house 
For sundry creatures (horses, oxen, cows, 
Billy goats); while flocks of poultry dwell upstairs 
With crawling insects too, and snakes in pairs. 
The oddly formed rear section brings to mind 
The Temple of Solomon on the Mount, designed 
By Hiram's carpenters—who for their part 
Had been the first to learn the builder's art. 
Synagogues still are built this way; in turn, 
Their shape is seen in that of inn and barn. 
A roof of thatch and unplaned boards juts high, 
Like a ragged Jewish hat, into the sky. 
Above are long rows of wooden galleries 
On moldering pillars that are mysteries 
Of architecture—leaning to one side 
Like Pisa's famous tower, still they abide, 
Shunning, in fact, the models of Ancient Greece 
For the pillars lack both capital and base. 
They're topped with arches (also made of wood), 
Half-rounded, copying the Gothic mode,
Formed not with burin or with chisel, but by 
The carpenter's ax, deployed most artfully. 
They curve like the arms of sabbath candlesticks. 
At the end are knobs, a little like the box 
That Jews strap to their foreheads when they pray, 
Called ""tzitzit"" in their tongue.

Napoleon Orda, renowned Polish-Lithuanian artist, painted at least two wooden synagogues.

El Lissitzky wrote about the murals in Cold synagogue in Mogilev after his and Issachar Ber Ryback's expedition:

The centerpiece of the whole place is the ceiling. On the western side, by the entrance, there stand giant lions and, behind them, peacocks. The lions hold two shields with inscriptions, the lower one is a memorial by the master for himself. Then there are three northern and three southern panels like a kind of frieze upon which unfurls the lives of predators and prey. Below there is water, upon it the earth, above the earth a sky; in the sky, stars that blossom into flowers. In the water—fish; they are being caught by the birds. On the earth a fox carries a bird in its snout. A bear climbs a tree looking for honey. Birds carry snakes in their beaks. All these flying things and running things—are people. Through their four-footed or feathered masks they look with human eyes. This is a very significant trend in Jewish folk art. Is that not a rabbinical face in the lion’s head in the zodiac paintings of the Mogilev Shul?

""Jewish period"" was very short in the art of El Lissitzky; on the contrary, for Issachar Ber Ryback everyday life of a Jewish shtetl became the foundation of his art. Ryback created several paintings of wooden synagogues, he probably was inspired for these works during the shtetl tour few years earlier.

Marc Chagall claimed that Chaim Segal, the artist who created murals in the Cold synagogue in Mogilev and several other synagogues, was his great-grandfather, and compares his own art to Segal's synagogue murals:

Jews, if they feel like it (I do), may cry that the painters of the shtetl wooden synagogues (why am I not with you in one grave) and the whittlers of the wooden synagogue rattles — ""Hush!"" (I saw it in An-sky's collection, got seared) are gone. But what is really the difference between my crippled Mohilev great-grandfather Segal who painted the Mohilev synagogue and me, who painted the Yiddish theater (a good theater) in Moscow? Believe me, no fewer lice visited both of us as we wallowed on the floor and in workshops. in synagogues and in theater. Furthermore, I am sure that, if I stop shaving, you would see his precise portrait...

By the way, my father [looked like him]. Believe me, I put quite a bit of effort, no less love (and what love!) have we both expended.

The difference is only that he [Segal] took orders for signs and I studied in Paris, about which he also heard something.

Although it was long thought that none of the wooden synagogues survived the destruction of the First and Second World Wars, it is now known that a number do survive, albeit only of the smaller type.[26][27]

Almost all wooden synagogues were destroyed in the 20th century. Some of them were documented during the ethnographic expeditions.

There is a replica of the Wołpa Synagogue in Bilgoraj, and another replica of the synagogue (Połaniec) is in Sanok.

POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw has a partial reconstruction of the Gwoździec Synagogue. The ceiling painting of the synagogue in Chodoriw was reconstructed for the ANU - Museum of the Jewish People (Beit Hatefusot) in Tel Aviv.

In the Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme (Museum of Jewish Art and History) in Paris there are models of several wooden synagogues.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_synagogues_in_the_Polish–Lithuanian_Commonwealth
Seventh Fort,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Fort
Morta of Lithuania,"Morta (died in 1263) was Queen of Lithuania (1253–1262) upon the accession of her husband, King Mindaugas. Very little is known about her life. Probably, Morta was Mindaugas' second wife as Vaišvilkas, the eldest son of Mindaugas, was already a mature man active in international politics when Morta's sons were still young and dependent on the parents.[1] After her death, Mindaugas married her sister, the wife of Daumantas. In revenge, Daumantas allied with Treniota and assassinated Mindaugas and two of Morta's sons in 1263.

Her pagan name is unknown. The only clue into her origin or birthplace is a short mention in the comments following the treaty signed in 1219 between the Lithuanian dukes and Galicia–Volhynia.[2] It says that Mindaugas killed many members of the Bulaičiai family, including Vismantas, whose wife Mindaugas took for himself. The Hypatian Codex elaborates that Vismantas was killed in 1251–1253 during an attack against Vykintas' castle (often assumed to be in Tverai).[2] It is generally assumed that Morta was Vismantas' wife. Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius analyzed toponyms and determined that the Bulaičiai family most likely hailed from the Šiauliai region. Based on this extrapolation, residents of Šiauliai call the city home of Morta.[2]

In the 16th-century Preussische Chronik, it is mentioned that Morta was actually from Sweden since at the time it was a common practice for pagan rulers who were seeking the throne to marry Christian brides from foreign countries. However, historians consider this claim to be untrue, suggesting that German chroniclers only thought so because they could not believe that a Lithuanian pagan could be such a fierce defender of Western Christianity.[3]

Morta's life is briefly described in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle. The Chronicle paints an image of a capable woman who advised her husband in political affairs and even provides several colorful dialogues between her and Mindaugas.[4] According to the Chronicle, she supported Lithuanian conversion to Christianity, opposed Treniota, and defended the Christians when Mindaugas relapsed to his pagan faith. Taking into account her support to the Christians and the fact that her pagan name is unknown, Rimvydas Petrauskas proposed that perhaps Morta was baptized earlier than Mindaugas (he was baptized c. 1252 by the Bishop of Chełmno).[4]

The written sources contain little information on Morta's family and it is not entirely clear how many children she had. Two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, are mentioned once in an act dated August 7, 1261. The act, by which Mindaugas granted all of Selonia to the Livonian Order, could be a medieval forgery by the Order.[1] According to the Hypatian Codex, two sons, Rūklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas in 1263. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these were the same two sons, whose names were distorted by medieval scribes, or whether there were four sons.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morta_of_Lithuania
Saulė,"Saulė (Lithuanian: Saulė, Latvian: Saule) is a solar goddess, the common Baltic solar deity in the Lithuanian and Latvian mythologies. The noun Saulė/Saule in the Lithuanian and Latvian languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Baltic name *Sauliā > *Saulē.[1]

Saulė is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of the sun itself, responsible for all life on Earth. She is the patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. The Lithuanian and Latvian words for ""the world"" (pasaulis and pasaule) are translated as ""[a place] under the Sun"".

Saulė is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to the Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a smith named Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky.[2] Missionary Jerome of Prague (ca. 1369–1440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about the kidnapped Saulė. She was held in a tower by a powerful king and rescued by the zodiac (Signa Zodiaci) using a giant sledgehammer. Jerome swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals.[3]

Saulė and Mėnuo/Mēness (the Moon) were wife and husband. Mėnuo fell in love with Aušrinė (the morning star or Venus). For his infidelity, Perkūnas (thunder god) punished Mėnuo. There are different accounts of the punishment. One version has it that Mėnuo was cut into two pieces, but he did not learn from his mistakes and thus the punishment is repeated every month. Another version claims that Mėnuo and Saulė divorced, but both wanted to see their daughter Žemyna (earth).[4] That is why the Sun shines during the day, while the Moon visits at night. A third version claims that the face of Mėnuo was disfigured by either Dievas (the supreme god) or Saulė.[5]

In other myths, Aušrinė is depicted as a daughter and servant of Saulė. Aušrinė lights the fire for Saulė and makes her ready for another day's journey across the sky. Vakarinė (the evening star) makes the bed for Saulė in the evening. In the Lithuanian mythology, Saulė was mother of other planets: Indraja (Jupiter), Sėlija (Saturn), Žiezdrė (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury).[5]

Saulė's feast was celebrated during the summer solstice. Lithuanian Rasos (turned into Saint Jonas' Festival by Christianity) and Latvian Līgo (turned into Jāņi) involve making wreaths, looking for the magical fern flower, burning bonfires, dancing around and leaping over the fire, and greeting the Sun when it rises at around 4 am next morning.[6] It is the most joyous traditional holiday. The winter solstice is celebrated as the return of Saulė. Christianity absorbed Lithuanian Kūčios and Latvian Ziemassvētki into Christmas. Other celebrations took place around the equinoxes.[5]

In Latvian folk songs, Saule and her daughter(s) are dressed of shawls woven with gold thread and Saule wears shoes of gold.[7] She is also depicted in a silver, gold or silk costume and wearing a sparkling crown.[8]

She is sometimes portrayed as waking up ""red"" (sārta) or ""in a red tree"" during the morning.[9] Saule is also said to own golden tools and garments: slippers, scarf, belt, and a golden boat she uses as her means of transportation.[10] Other accounts ascribe her golden rings, golden ribbons, golden tassels, and even a golden crown.[11]

Saule is also described as being dressed in clothes woven with ""threads of red, gold, silver and white"".[12] In the Lithuanian tradition, the sun is also described as a ""golden wheel"" or a ""golden circle"" that rolls down the mountain at sunset.[13] Also in Latvian riddles and songs, Saule is associated with the color red as if to indicate the ""fiery aspect"" of the sun: the setting and the rising sun are equated with a rose wreath and a rose in bloom due to their circular shapes.[14][11][15][a]

Saulė is portrayed dancing in her gilded shoes on a silver hill and her fellow Baltic goddess Aušrinė is said to dance on a stone for the people on the first day of summer.[17][18] In Lithuania, the Sun (identified as female) rides a car towards her husband, the Moon, ""dancing and emitting fiery sparks"" on the way.[19]

In a myth from Lithuania, a man named Joseph becomes fascinated with Aušrinė appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the ""second sun"", who is actually a maiden that lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair like the Sun.[17] In the Baltic folklore, Saulė is said to live in a silver gated castle at the end of the sea,[20] located somewhere in the east,[21] or to go to an island in the middle of the sea for her nocturnal rest.[22] In folksongs, Saule sinks into the bottom of a lake to sleep at night, in a silver cradle ""in the white seafoam"".[23][b]

The Sun, which has a feminine gender in Baltic languages, is described as an anthromorphized being that rides across the celestial abode in a vehicle, like a carriage or a chariot, which is described as saulės ratai in Lithuanian and saules rati in Latvian.[25]

Saulė also drives a carriage with copper wheels,[26] a ""gleaming copper chariot""[27] or a golden chariot[28] pulled by untiring horses or a ""pretty little sleigh"" (kamaņiņa) made of fish-bones.[29][30] Saulė is also described as driving her shining car on the way to her husband, the Moon.[19] In other accounts, she is said to sail the seas on a silver[31] or a golden boat,[27] which, according to legend, is what her chariot transforms into for her night travels.[21][32] In a Latvian folksong, Saule hangs her sparkling crown on a tree in the evening and enters a golden boat to sail away.[8]

The Sun is associated with horses in Baltic mythology: Lithuanian riddles describe the Sun as a ball with a hundred horses (""šimtas arklių nepavež"") - an image repeated in Latvian songs (""Simts kumeliņu"").[33]

Saulė's horses are also mentioned in several pieces of Baltic folklore. Her horses are said to be of white color;[21] in other accounts they amount to three steeds of golden, silver and diamond colors.[19] In Latvian dainas (folk songs), her horses are described as yellow,[34] of a golden or a fiery color.[32] The sun's steeds are also portrayed as having hooves and bridles of gold in the dainas, and as golden beings themselves or of a bay colour, ""reflect[ing] the hues of the bright or the twilight sky"".[35] When she begins her nocturnal journey through the World Sea, her chariot changes into a boat and ""the Sun swims her horses"",[31] which signifies that ""she stops to wash her horses in the sea"".[36]

Scholarship points that the expressions geltoni žirgeliai or dzelteni kumeliņi ('golden' or 'yellow horses'), which appear in Latvian dainas, seem to be a recurrent poetic motif.[11] According to Nijole Laurinkiene, the expression could refer to a golden or fiery character to the animals.[37]

According to studies by professor Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga and ethnologue Nijolė Laurinkienė [lt], Saule is also depicted in folksongs as a ""mother"" (Lithuanian motinėlė, Latvian māmuliņa)[32] who comforts orphans, which is the reason why the sun takes time to rise.[38] In other folksongs, the personified female Sun is also associated with the color ""white"" (Latv balt-), such as the imagery of a white shirt, the expression ""mīļā, balte"" (""Sun, dear, white""), and the description of the trajectory of the sun (red as it rises, white as it journeys on its way).[39]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saulė
Kaunas Mint,"The Kaunas Mint (Lithuanian: Kauno monetų kalykla) was a Lithuanian mint which produced coins in Kaunas that operated between 1665 and 1667 and again between 1936 and 1939.[1]

The mint was founded on 17 October 1665, during the reign of Grand Duke John II Casimir Vasa of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Building of the mint (10 × 25 meters in size) was located in Kaunas Town Hall Square and was governed by A. G. fon Horn, whose initials GFH were minted on the coins as well.[1] It minted copper shillings (also known as boratynka).[1][2][6] In total, more than 40 million coins were minted in the Kaunas Mint, until 15 January 1667.[1]

In 1936, the Kaunas Mint was reestablished by the Ministry of Finance of Lithuania and produced coins from 16 May 1936 to 1939.[7][8][9][10] In 1936, it minted bronze coins of 1, 2, 5 cents, silver coins of 1 Lithuanian litas (with the date of 1925), 5 litas (with a portrait of Jonas Basanavičius) and 10 litas (with a portrait of Vytautas the Great).[7] In 1938, a commemorative silver coin, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of Independent Lithuania, was minted there.[7] In total, more than 25 million coins were minted in the Kaunas mint, while coins, their stamps and blanks were made in Belgium.[7] The mint was located on the ground floor of the building of the joint-stock company Spindulys, governed by Jonas Karys-Kareckas.[7]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaunas_Mint

Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission,"The Provisional Government Commission of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; also, the Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission (Lithuanian: Lietuvos laikinosios vyriausybės komisija; also Lietuvos Didžiosios Kunigaikštystės vyriausybės komisija, Polish: Komisja Rządu Tymczasowego Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego; also Komisja Rządząca Tymczasowa Litewska; French: Gouvernement provisoire de Lituanie; also Gouvernement général de la Lituanie) was a provisional administrative body for Lithuania, which had been overtaken by Napoleon's Grand Army during the 1812 French invasion of Russia.[1] On 14 July 1812 the Commission formally joined the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, creating the united Kingdom of Poland.

The commission was established on 1 July 1812 by order of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.[2] Its chief tasks included the creation of Lithuanian armed forces, and the provisioning of Napoleon's troops.[2] The governotes (later changed to ""departments"") of Vilnius, Grodno, Minsk and Białystok were attached to the jurisdiction of the government of Lithuania.

Central, regional and local bodies of the civil administration of the 4 provinces were subordinated to him. Departments were divided into divisions headed by sub-prefects. In each of them, and later in the Vitebsk and Mogilev departments (not subordinate to the government, subordinate to the military governor Charpentier), an administrative commission of 3 members, appointed or approved by Napoleon, was organized under the chairmanship of the French quartermaster. 
The structure of municipal (city) self-government was organized according to the example of Vilnius. At the same time, a system of military-administrative management of the region was created. 
The bodies of the Napoleonic administration were mainly involved in the organization of armed formations, provision of troops, and collection of funds.[2]

The Provisional Government of Lithuania, initially, had no connections to Poland.[3]

Supervision of the commission was entrusted to the former French Resident in the Duchy of Warsaw, Commissioner Louis Pierre Édouard Bignon. Actual power, however, was exercised by Dutch General Dirk van Hogendorp, former governor of Java, who was appointed governor of Vilnius.

Napoleon, contrary to the hopes reposed in him by the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, had not restored Polish statehood to the former Polish–Lithuanian lands.  He had merely established, in the conquered territories, a provisional administration, thereby sidestepping final dispositions pending his further conquest of Russia.

Józef Wybicki, sent on 11 July 1812 to Vilnius with a deputation from the Council of the General Confederation, unsuccessfully attempted to get the Emperor to declare the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, including the territories that had been annexed in the Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Napoleon also refused to attach the military units consisting of Lithuanians to the Polish ones.

Only on 14 July 1812 the Commission formally joined the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, creating the united Kingdom of Poland.

After Russian troops invaded Lithuanian territory at the end of 1812, the Commission acted outside Lithuania.

Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1507–1508),"Lithuanian-Muscovite War (1507-1508) also known as the Third Lithuanian-Muscovite War was a war between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania supported by the Kingdom of Poland against the Principality of Moscow.

On February 2, 1507, the Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania passed a resolution on its readiness to declare war on the Principality of Moscow. Casus belli was the Russians' rejection of the Lithuanian ultimatum, calling on Moscow to return all Lithuanian lands captured after 1494. Lithuanian troops carried out three concentrations: one in Smolensk under the command of Albertas Goštautas, another in Polotsk commanded by Stanisław Hlebowicz [pl] and the third one in Minsk under the command of the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Stanisław Kiszka.

In April 1507, Muscovite troops attacked the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, but quickly retreated when King Sigismund I the Old carried out an offensive attack, crossing the Berezina river at the front of his troops. In August, Grand Hetman of Lithuania Stanisław Kiszka gathered his troops in the camp near Drutsk. At the same time, the Crimean Tatars of Khan Meñli I Giray, allied with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, attacked the Principality of Moscow. In October, the Grand Duke of Moscow, Vasili III of Russia, repelled the Tatar attack and attacked the Lithuanian fortresses of Mstsislaw and Krychaw. However, he did not capture these fortresses, threatened by the army of Stanisław Kiszka. In September, Grand Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski of Lithuania escaped from Russian captivity and his command of the Polish-Lithuanian army was restored.

During the 1508 campaign, Lithuanian Court marshal Michael Glinski switched to the side of the Principality of Moscow and unsuccessfully tried to start an uprising against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in Belarus. Muscovite troops besieged Minsk, Orsha and Slutsk. On July 18, the Russians were forced to stop their siege, threatened by the Polish-Lithuanian troops led by Ostrogski and Mikołaj Firlej, who on July 13, 1508, defeated the Muscovite army in the Battle of Orsha [pl].[3] Ostrogski managed to retake Smolensk. At the beginning of August, peace negotiations began, which Sigismund I wanted to support with an armed demonstration. Stanisław Kiszka, at the head of several thousand Polish-Lithuanian cavalry, attacked far into the Muscovite lands. He advanced towards Moscow, capturing Dorogobuzh, Vyazma, Toropets and Biela, approaching Rzhev and Mozhaysk.

On October 8, 1508, perpetual peace was concluded in Moscow. According to it, Gliński returned all his occupied towns,[4] Russia renounced Liubech (and therefore access to the Dnieper)[5] and ceded six border counties.[6] Lithuania, in turn, recognized all Russian conquests during the previous war, including Chernihiv.[7]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian–Muscovite_War_(1507–1508)
Žirmūnai,"Žirmūnai (pronounced [ʑɪrˈmuːnɐi] ⓘ) is the most populous administrative division (elderate) in Vilnius. It is also a neighbourhood in the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius, encompassing the city district of the same name, built in the 1960s.

Žirmūnai's history has been traced to the late 14th century, when a Lithuanian fishing village was founded across the River Neris from Vilnius' Old Town.[2] Several historic sites in Žirmūnai are internationally significant; it is the home of Lithuania's largest Jewish cemetery, as well as the location of mass graves of soldiers belonging to Napoleon's Grande Armée and victims of the NKGB's and MGB's executions after World War II.[3][4] Tuskulėnai Manor, built in 1825, and the surrounding Peace Park  are important historical and cultural attractions in Vilnius.[citation needed]

The area was given the name Žirmūnai during the early 1960s, when it became the site of an award-winning residential construction project; it was the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at the time. The massive Palace of Concerts and Sports and Žalgiris Stadium are other relics of Žirmūnai's Soviet history.[5] Žirmūnai was important to the industrial sector in the USSR; since that time, this function has been replaced or supplanted by newer businesses, including some of Lithuania's leading companies.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai has undergone major renovation and development in the 21st century. Šiaurės miestelis (""North Town"") is an area of Žirmūnai that has rapidly evolved into one of the key business and residential districts of the city. This quarter was used by a number of regimes as a military garrison, and internationally significant historical findings have been made in the area.[citation needed]

The Žirmūnai elderate occupies 5.7 km2 or 1.4% of the total area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The elderate extends for about 4.4 kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5 kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai elderate is only some 450 metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in the centre of the city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary is defined by the following streets (from north to south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary.[6] Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.[citation needed]

Despite the proximity of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline,[7] the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.[citation needed]

The Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris, from a point near Žirmūnai Bridge and continuing downstream, was stabilised during the 1980s with a steeply-sloped concrete net-like structure which includes patches of grass between the ""webbing"" of the net; the lower part of the fortification is a concrete tiled walkway, ending just over 4 kilometres downstream, beyond Liubartas Bridge in Žvėrynas. The walkway is used extensively by walkers, joggers, and cyclists, as well as providing seating for anglers. Construction vehicles sometimes use it to reach work areas. The walkway is submerged during the river floods, mostly in springtime.[citation needed]

As of the census taken in April 2001, the ethnic makeup of Žirmūnai was 59.2% Lithuanian, 16.8% Russian (the third highest percentage among Vilnius' elderates, behind Naujoji Vilnia and Naujininkai), 14.4% Poles, 3.8% Belarusian, 1.7% Ukrainian, 0.8% Jewish, 0.2% Tatar, 0.1% Latvian, 0.1% Armenian, and 2.9% other or unspecified ethnicity.[8]

According to the 2001 census, Žirmūnai was the most populous elderate in Vilnius (47,410 residents, comprising 8.7% of Vilnius' total population[9]) and the third most populous in Lithuania after Šilainiai and Dainava, Kaunas. The population density was 8,317.5/km2. According to the census, there were 21,363 private households in the Žirmūnai elderate,[8] making for an average household size of about 2.2 persons. The population of Žirmūnai has been rapidly increasing, largely due to construction of residential buildings in the Šiaurės miestelis section of the elderate. A former elder of Žirmūnai estimated its 2002 population to be about 60,000 residents – an increase of about 13,000 over the 2001 census figure. This rapid growth has placed a strain on city services.[10]

Žirmūnai is occasionally described as a ""borough of elderly people"" or even a ""borough of elderly women"". There is a certain statistical basis to the claim: according to the data of the April 2001 census,[11] only about 43.5% of Žirmūnai's population were male, the second lowest percentage in Vilnius, after Žvėrynas (43.1%); 27.4% of the population (33.2% of women and 19.9% of men)[8] were of legal retirement age, which was 57.5 years for women and 61.5 years for men at the time. This is the highest percentage in Vilnius; accordingly, Žirmūnai had the lowest percentage of residents that were statistically of working age (defined as over age 15 and up to the retirement age) in Vilnius, only 56.4% in total: 52.8% of women and 61.1% of men.[citation needed]

The heavy proportion of elderly persons in the district may be attributed to the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed male–female ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.[12]

At the time of the 2001 census, persons aged between 0 and 15 years comprised 16.1% of Žirmūnai's population, the second lowest percentage among Vilnius' elderates, slightly higher than Viršuliškės at 15.5%.  However, it is likely that the average age of Žirmūnai's residents has decreased since the last census, and will continue to decrease, as a result of the active construction of new dwellings, which are acquired primarily by younger people. As housing prices rise, retirees are motivated to sell their apartments with the goal of acquiring cheaper housing elsewhere with funds to spare.[citation needed]

In 2005, 2,317 crimes were registered in the Žirmūnai elderate.  This is the third highest figure among Vilnius' elderates, behind the Old Town and Naujamiestis.  Using the population data of the latest available census (2001), this would amount to about 48.9 crimes per 1,000 residents per year (only the eighth highest figure, due to the elderate's large population; Vilnius' total crime rate, using the same population data, would be about 51 crimes per 1,000 residents).  In terms of crime density, 406.5 crimes per 1 square kilometre were registered (the fourth highest figure, behind the Old Town, Naujamiestis and Šnipiškės; Vilnius' total crime density, using the same population data, would be about 70.4).[13]

However, thanks largely to the crime prevention programme Saugus miestas (""Safe City""), crime rates in Žirmūnai, as in all other elderates of Vilnius, are declining. For instance, 886 crimes were registered in Žirmūnai during the first four months of 2005, versus 672 during the same period of 2006, a decline of about 24%.[13] If this trend continues, Žirmūnai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents.[citation needed]

The most frequently registered crimes during the first four months of 2006 were: theft (335 instances, including 19 car thefts, constituting about 50% of the total number of crimes); rape (259 instances or about 38.5% of the total); robbery (44 instances or about 6.5%); and bodily injury (20 instances or about 3%). Percentage data may overlap as one criminal act may have several features, which are registered separately, but the total number of crimes is calculated per incident.[13]

The elderate of Žirmūnai embraces three historical suburbs of Vilnius: Žvejai, Tuskulėnai and Šiaurės miestelis. Fishing village Žvejai dating to the 14th century included the only glass factory in the 16th century Lithuania, as well as the largest Jewish cemetery. It became an integral part of Vilnius in the 16th century. The area south of Žvejai became known after the name of the Tusculanum Manor. Manor itself was a property of noble families and officials, and is the oldest building in Žirmūnai. In the 19th century, a military garrison was established in  the present-day Šiaurės miestelis, which was used by Russian, French and Polish armies. These territories were consolidated into Vilnius city during the  period of rapid growth that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. The Tuskulėnai Manor was used as the KGB officers' apartments back then. In the last years, a housing renovation program was launched in Žirmūnai. Military structures in Šiaurės miestelis of a historical value have been preserved and restored. Šiaurės miestelis became one of the most sought–after residential and commercial areas of Vilnius.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai's southernmost section, which lies on the bank of the River Neris opposite the Vilnius Castle Complex, was part of the settlement known as Žvejai; another part of that settlement is now located within the elderate of Šnipiškės. According to archaeological surveys from 2005, a fishing village may have been located here as early as the late 14th century, giving the area its name, literally, Fishermen; it was later settled by craftsmen and housed the Orthodox Church of St Barbara.[2] During the 16th century, the only glass factory in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was located in the suburb of Žvejai.[14] In 1563, after the construction of the first bridge over the River Neris (at the approximate location of today's Mindaugas Bridge), the suburb of Žvejai became an integral part of the city of Vilnius.[14] During Tsarist rule in the 19th century, the name of Žvejai was superseded by that of Piramont, originating from the small estate of Piramont in the area (now Kalvarijų 1).[15] Piramontskij Alley can be seen in a 1904 map of Vilnius[16] where today's A. Juozapavičiaus Street in the elderate of Šnipiškės is located, close to the boundary of Žirmūnai. The usage of Piramont as a placename gradually became limited to the southern part of Žvejai.[citation needed]

The heritage of Žvejai was retained in the name of Žvejų (""Fishermen's"") Street, which runs alongside the River Neris in southern Šnipiškės and Žirmūnai. However, the Žirmūnai section of this street was renamed Olimpiečių (""Olympians"") in 2000 to commemorate the achievements of Lithuanian Olympic athletes in the Sydney Olympics.[17]

The largest and oldest Jewish cemetery in Lithuania, first mentioned in 1592, was also located in Žvejai. It was known in the local Jewish community as Shnipishok.[18] The Yiddish placename later became associated with the whole borough of Šnipiškės, now bordering Žirmūnai on the west. Although the cemetery was officially closed in 1830 and was subject to gradual deterioration, there were further interments. Vilna Gaon, as well as other famous Vilnian Jews, were interred in the cemetery.[citation needed]

During the years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the area on the right bank of the River Neris opposite the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Antakalnis, a Royal Manor called Derevnictva (Polish: Derewnictwo), was established in the mid-16th century by King Sigismund Augustus as an outpost of the Vilnius Castles. The manor was held by the kings Sigismund III Vasa and Władysław IV Vasa, nobleman M. Piegłowski, the Wołowicz family, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Michał Kazimierz Pac, as well by the Tyzenhaus family after 1741. In the mid-18th century, Lateran monks acquired the manor and named it Tusculanum, after the resort outside the ancient Roman city of Tusculum.[19] (see also: Villa Rufinella) The surrounding forests were used as a game reserve and for sport fishing. Towards the end of the century, the manor was separated into the folwarks of Tuskulėnai, based on the core of the old royal manor, and Derevnictva.[20]

Under the rule of the Russian Empire in the 19th century, the Tuskulėnai Manor was held by various noble families and high-ranking state officials, including Governor General of Lithuanian–Vilna Governorate, Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov. In the mid-19th century the main palace was transformed into a guesthouse that became a cultural center in Vilnius, often visited by Stanislaw Moniuszko and Józef Ignacy Kraszewski.[21] The manor passed into the possession of Julija Safranovich after 1886, and then was held by Olga Melentjeva and her noble family until World War II.[citation needed]

The area surrounding Tuskulėnai Manor was referred to as Tuskulėnai (Russian: Tuskuljany;[16] Polish: Tuskulanum)[22] until World War II. This area was also known as Losiovka or Losiuvka, colloquially named after A. Losev, colonel of Special Corps of Gendarmes and later general of the Russian Empire, who owned the folwark of Tuskulėnai in 1869. The placenames are associated primarily with individual wooden houses, built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some of which are still scattered among the apartment buildings.[23]

A military garrison was built in the approximate location of the modern Šiaurės miestelis (""North Town"", that is, north of Old Vilnius) section of Žirmūnai by the Russian Empire during the 19th century. This area went on to be used as a garrison by a number of armies: Napoleon's Grande Armée in 1812, Tsarist for the rest of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century (see: the 27th infantry division's camp in the map of 1904[16]), the Bolsheviks during World War I, the Polish army in the inter-war period, and the Red Army from the 1950s to 1992.[citation needed]

During the interwar period, when Vilnius was under Polish control, the southern part of Žvejai was known as Pióromont;[22] the entire Žvejai area was referred to as Rybaki (Polish for ""Fishermen""); modern Šiaurės miestelis had been called Plac broni (Polish for the ""Military training ground""); and the old placename of Derewnictwo, dating back to the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, applied to the area north of Tuskulėnai Manor.[24]

A map of Vilnius published in 1942, while the city was under Nazi rule, shows the northern part of Žirmūnai as Paneriškės,[25] the middle section as Kareiviškės (""place of soldiers"") and the southern part, close to the Tuskulėnai Manor, as Mantiškės (""a place named in honour of Mantas""). One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas (Herkus Monte), a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising; today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Šnipiškės elderate ending at the boundary of Žirmūnai.[26]

A Soviet military base was established in the current Šiaurės miestelis section of Žirmūnai during the 1950s. The heavily wooded northernmost part of the elderate was thinly populated until the 1960s.[citation needed]

During the 1960s, Žirmūnai attracted the attention of urban planners; it became the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at that time. Designed in 1962, the district consisted of three microdistricts – residential and industrial sections centred around public facilities and had been the largest residential area in the city.[citation needed]

The first microdistrict, or ""Žirmūnai I"", which is district's middle section, was built in 1962—67 in accordance with a project by architect Birutė Kasperavičienė, who was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1968, together with architect Bronislovas Krūminis and engineers Ṧmuelis Liubeckis and Vaclovas Zubras;[27] it was the first time this award had been presented to the designers of a large-scale residential construction. The second microdistrict, ""Žirmūnai II"", which is the southernmost of the three, was built in 1964—68, its architect being Nijolė Chlomauskienė. And the third, the northernmost microdistrict, ""Žirmūnai III"" designed by architect Laima Burneikienė was built in 1964—69 in the site of the former village of Paneriškės.[28] The city district was then named after the formerly Lithuanian[29] village of Žirmūnai (Zhirmuny), now situated 16 kilometres from the Lithuania–Belarus border in the Voranauski District, Hrodna province of Belarus. This village is where Karol Podczaszyński, an architect and designer of Tuskulėnai Manor, was born. Hence the future district's major street Žirmūnų was named after the village as it is seen in the map of 1942[26] and gave its name to the entire district.[clarification needed]

The new residential housing in the microdistrict consisted almost exclusively of five-story prefabricated concrete block apartment buildings popularly known as khrushchyovkas. Three nine-story high-rise apartment buildings were built in 1969, and several more were constructed later, as well as seven brick-built twelve-storeys. The apartment buildings were meant primarily to accommodate industrial workers who came to Vilnius from other regions of the Lithuanian SSR and from other Soviet Republics. They typify the Brutalist architecture of the era. The principles governing the design of the microdistrict were set forth in books by the University of Moscow planners, for instance in New Element of Populating. En Route to the New City published in the USSR in 1966[30] (although the concept of the ""new element"" has been dated to 1959[31]); the book was later published as The Ideal Communist City in the United States, United Kingdom and Italy.[32] According to the book, the optimal apartment size was about 600 square feet (56 square metres), with one bathroom and two bedrooms. Single-family homes were considered ""too 
autonomous"".[33]

The ancient Jewish cemetery in Žvejai stood in the way of the expansion. Many tombstones were destroyed in 1950 during the construction of Žalgiris Stadium; the cemetery was completely demolished in 1955 in accordance with a decree issued by local authorities in 1948.[2] The bodies of Vilna Gaon and several members of his immediate family were relocated, after receiving special permission from the Soviet authorities; this relocation has been the subject of historical controversy.[34] The cemetery was the subject of an archaeological survey in the late 1990s. A memorial stone was placed in the southeastern portion of the former cemetery with an inscription in Yiddish and Lithuanian, stating that the cemetery was established there in 1478 (this dating is disputed).[citation needed]

An incident in Žirmūnai's history that has been difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris,[35] that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.[citation needed]

Tuskulėnai Manor had been nationalised in 1940 and was later used as KGB officers' apartments and as a kindergarten. During excavations that took place between 1994 and 1996 in its territory, the remains of 706 bodies were found; 40 were identified.[36] The area had been used to hide the bodies of Lithuanian residents – mostly resistance fighters against the Soviet occupation and Nazi collaborators – who had been executed by the NKGB and MGB in the Vilnius' KGB Palace between 1944 and 1947 but also those who died fighting Polish Armia Krajowa soldiers. The remains from the mass grave were placed in a columbarium built underground, beneath an artificial hill, and consecrated in 2004.[citation needed]

In 2001, workers laying telephone line in Šiaurės miestelis, near the former garrison, discovered a mass grave that was found to contain the bodies of about 2,000 soldiers – the remnants of Napoleon's Grande Armée as it retreated from Moscow. In December 1812, temperatures in Vilnius had sunk to −30 °C, and the frozen ground made proper burials impossible. The Grande Armée at that time comprised French, Portuguese, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, and Croats, as well as Lithuanians and Poles.[4] The bones have been intensively studied by forensic pathologists; DNA evidence showed that many of the deaths were caused by typhus.[37] Most of the remains were re-interred in Antakalnis Cemetery. Other findings included buttons stamped with Napoleon's image, crucifixes, wedding rings, belt buckles, boots and pieces of French uniforms. Footage from the location has been used in the TV series Moments in Time produced by Discovery Channel[38] and Meet the Ancestors[39] by BBC.[40] The archaeological surveys were partially sponsored by the producers.[41]

The Red Army military base in Žirmūnai was abandoned in 1992, a few years after Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union; a grace period was granted in order to ensure the orderly resettlement of the soldiers and their families.[citation needed]

Due to the Soviet principles of urban planning, Žirmūnai, according to the 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments.[42] The scarcity of lots means that the number of single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, there were only a few modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai's housing, especially in its central sections, is in need of extensive renovation, due to wear and tear of its low or medium-quality construction. A program to renew old apartment buildings (including the installation of better insulation) is ongoing in Vilnius, partially assisted by the Vilnius City Municipality; the first finished renovation project – a completely renewed 60-apartment building built in 1965 – is located in Žirmūnai.[43] The area is, in some ways, analogous to public housing districts in Chicago and London; although much of the housing was quickly and inexpensively erected in the 1960s, its proximity to downtown Vilnius, its transportation infrastructure, and its access to the River Neris account for its popularity. The principles of Soviet urban planning that led to its growth have converged with the modern concept of ""Smart growth"".[citation needed]

The Šiaurės miestelis section of Žirmūnai is growing rapidly and in 2007 was one of Vilnius' most sought-after residential and commercial areas.[citation needed]

Many of the military structures that were built in the late 19th century in Šiaurės miestelis have been preserved and restored. Meanwhile, much of the construction that was not deemed to be of permanent value, erected during the Soviet times, has been demolished, leaving room for new streets and housing. The combination of military heritage sites and newer construction is a distinctive feature of Šiaurės miestelis.[citation needed]

Reflecting its military history, numerous street names in and around Šiaurės miestelis allude to military concepts, including Kareivių (""Soldiers""), Lakūnų (""Pilots""), Žygio (""March""), Apkasų (""Trenches""), Ulonų (""Light Cavalry""). The new streets built in Šiaurės miestelis during the beginning of the 21st century were named for prominent figures in Lithuanian military history: Povilas Lukšys, Lithuanian army volunteer, the first to perish in the Independence Wars in 1919 with the Bolshevik forces, as well as Kazys Ladyga, Silvestras Žukauskas, Jonas Galvydis-Bikauskas, Vladas Nagevičius, and Jurgis Kubilius, prominent officers of the inter-war Lithuanian Army, whose histories are not directly related to the area. On the contrary, these personalities distinguished themselves by opposing the Bolshevik and Polish armies that were historically garrisoned in Šiaurės miestelis. The naming was suggested by the Ministry of Defence.[44] There are more streets not far from Šiaurės miestelis that bear military-themed names: Raitininkų (""Cavalrymen""), Žvalgų (""Scouts"") and Rinktinės (""Platoon"").[citation needed]

An international dispute arose in the 2000s over construction near the Jewish cemetery, with organizations expressing concerns that gravesites could be disturbed.[45][46]

The educational institutions in Žirmūnai include three secondary schools, all Lithuanian-language. Tuskulėnai Secondary School (Lithuanian: Tuskulėnų vidurinė mokykla, formerly Vilnius' Secondary School No. 31) had 1,463 students in 2006, which made it the fifth largest school in Vilnius. The school features advanced classes in the visual arts. St. Christopher's Gymnasium (Lithuanian: Šv. Kristoforo gimnazija, formerly Vilnius' Secondary School No. 9) was the eighth largest in Vilnius with 1,391 students in 2006. Žirmūnai Gymnasium (Lithuanian: Žirmūnų gimnazija, formerly Vilnius Secondary School No. 7) had 800 students in 2006.[47] The school was granted the title Gymnasium in 2000; it is home to the acclaimed brass band Septima, established in 1966.[48]

There are three elementary schools located in Žirmūnai: Antoni Wiwulski, Emilia Plater, and St. Christopher. Šarūnas Marčiulionis Basketball School and Vilnius Sports School offer physical education. The Vilnius School of Radioelectronics and Precision Mechanics (Lithuanian: Vilniaus radioelektronikos ir tiksliosios mechanikos mokykla)[49] was established in 1965 to prepare workers for Vilma, a manufacturer of electrical products still operating in Žirmūnai. The Vilnius School of Tourism and Commerce (Lithuanian: Vilniaus turizmo ir prekybos verslo mokykla) offers certificates in retailing, basic bookkeeping, hotel and restaurant services, and other business areas. Vilnius Gija Youth School serves those students who have special needs and do not succeed in traditional classroom settings. Žirmūnai also has one of the three Children's Foster Homes in Vilnius.[citation needed]

As of the census taken in April 2001, 26.2% of Žirmūnai's residents aged 10 or older possessed a bachelor's or higher degree.[citation needed]

Tuskulėnai Manor is Žirmūnai's oldest extant architectural structure. The manor was built in 1825, following a design by Karol Podczaszyński in the neoclassical style. It consists of the principal building (the palace), an officina (storage house), and several adjacent buildings, including a small eclectic chapel of St. Theresa located about 100 metres south of the principal building.[50] The ""Little White Manor"", also known as the villa of Franciszek Walicki, was built in 1866 further south from the manor, acquired by Walicki in 1928, and reconstructed to serve as a summer residence.[20] All of these structures have been restored by 2009, and are a part of the 7.5-hectare Peace Park (Rimties parkas) that includes the Tuskulėnai Manor, hosting a museum of martyrology in Lithuania in the second half of the 20th century (a branch of the Lithuanian Museum of Genocide Victims), restored landscaping, as well as the columbarium.[citation needed]

A Museum of Computing was opened in 2001 in Žirmūnai by the Lithuanian software company Sintagma, showcasing the history of Lithuanian computing science and hardware production. It was based on a museum opened in 1985 by Sigma, one of the leading computer manufacturers in the former Soviet Union. The museum's exhibits include EV-80, the first Soviet vacuum tube computing machine manufactured by Sigma, and a copy of the IBM 604.[51]

Three of the 19 brick chapels of the Vilnius Stations of the Cross (Vilniaus Kalvarijos), part of Verkiai Regional Park, are located at the extreme northwestern corner of Žirmūnai, just within the elderate's border. Once destroyed in 1963 and completely rebuilt, the three chapels, symbolizing the Mount of Olives and the Gardens of Gethsemane, are found only 20 meters away from the relatively busy Verkių Street, and about a hundred meters downhill from a group of Soviet multi-storey apartment buildings.[citation needed]

The forested area along the banks of the River Neris in Žirmūnai and its walkways are a popular recreational destination for many Vilnians.[citation needed]

As a primarily residential area, Žirmūnai hosted only 7.4% of Vilnius' public offices in 2003.[52] Žirmūnai is the location of the Personal Identity Documents Centre of Lithuania's Ministry of the Interior which produces all of Lithuania's identity cards, passports, and driver's licenses, as well as residency permits. Issuance of residence permits is controlled by Vilnius City Migration Service, which is housed in Žirmūnai too. The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Šiaurės Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine-related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the Vilnius city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Šiaurės Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

Several notable sports facilities are located in Žirmūnai, including Žalgiris Stadium, Lithuania's largest stadium,[5] and Impuls Plus fitness club. Rowing practices take place on the River Neris; there is a base of operation, as well as several piers, on the Žirmūnai bank of the river. One of Lithuania's largest indoor public swimming pools was situated in Žirmūnai until the 1990s. Part of the annual international Vilnius Marathon course runs along the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris.[53]

The Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports (Koncertų ir sporto rūmai), built in 1971 in the southernmost part of Žirmūnai in the middle of the former cemetery, is an example of Soviet Constructivism[54] and Brutalist architecture[citation needed], remarkable for its vessel-like exterior. The Palace, once one of the architectonic icons of Soviet Vilnius, was, until the 1990s, a major venue for sporting events, especially local and international basketball matches, as well as concerts and shows. Its seating capacity is about 4,400. On 22–23 October 1988 the building hosted the statutory meeting of Sąjūdis, the Lithuanian political organization that led the struggle for Lithuanian independence; on 14–15 January 1991, a public funeral for the victims of the January Events took place at the Palace. Later in the 1990s, the building was used as a temporary shopping mall where space was leased to small entrepreneurs for business exhibitions and fairs. In the 2000s developers announced plans to build multifunctional complexes, incorporating sports, business and residential structures, that would replace Žalgiris Stadium and the Palace of Concerts and Sports; the projects have been stalled due to the inclusion of the Palace into the list ""Registry of Cultural Values"" in July 2006,[55] and related litigation.[56]

The Vilnius Palace of Culture, Entertainment and Sports (an example of Soviet functionalism[57] built in 1980 as the Palace of Culture and Sports of the Ministry of Interior), hosts several amateur art clubs (choirs in particular), and is also used for indoor sports (wrestling, martial arts, artistic gymnastics, volleyball, basketball), as well as lawn tennis, including two clay courts.[citation needed]

Oskaras Koršunovas Theatre has occupied the former Lietuvos Rytas Arena which was the home of Lithuania's starring basketball team Lietuvos Rytas until the 2004 season, and was also used by the former women's basketball team BC Teo. Along with the Vilnius Palace of Culture, Entertainment and Sports, it was used in 2006 as part of the set for 9/11: The Twin Towers,[58] a docudrama about the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, a Dangerous Films production for BBC and Discovery Channel.[59] Ūkio banko teatro arena (""Ūkio Bankas Theater Arena"") is now the venue of performances of Eimuntas Nekrošius of Meno Fortas and Anželika Cholina Dance Theatre.[citation needed]

Southern Žirmūnai's sporting connections are reflected in the names of the streets along the Žirmūnai side of the River Neris: Sporto (""Sports"") and Olimpiečių (""Olympians""). The Palace of Students' Technical Creative Work of the Republic is Lithuania's largest facility for high school students' after-school activities of a technical nature, such as model building and go-kart racing. The Grand Theater of Vilnius (Didysis Vilniaus teatras) is a small theater (its misnomer is intentional) that is formally based in Šiaurės miestelis; it has no venue of its own and holds performances in other theaters.[60]

A building close to the western border of the Žirmūnai elderate, an example of Socialist historicism[61] built soon after the end of World War II, was the home of the Tėvynė (""Motherland"") Cinema until the early 1990s; it has been hosting the New York musical theatre and club since 2004.[62] It is unclear whether this building will be demolished to make way for underground parking lots or saved by virtue of its inclusion into the Registry of Cultural Values.[63]

1,414 businesses, comprising 8.7% of all Vilnius' businesses, were headquartered in the Žirmūnai elderate in 2003.[52] Lithuania's largest electricity distribution network operator, Rytų skirstomieji tinklai, operates from Žirmūnai, as well as  TELE2, one of Lithuania's three mobile communications operators; Ogmios, one of Lithuania's largest retailers and wholesalers of home appliances; and Vilpra, Lithuania's largest dealer of heating equipment.[citation needed]

In 1992, the former prominent Lithuanian basketball player Šarūnas Marčiulionis and his business partners opened the Šarūnas Hotel in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

The Banginis and Rimi Hypermarket, located in Šiaurės miestelis, are among Lithuania's largest shopping centers. Vilniaus duona (""The Bread of Vilnius""), Lithuania's largest baking company, operates one of its bakeries in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

An abundance of automotive service facilities and car dealerships are located in the elderate.

The northern part of Žirmūnai was an important part of the Lithuanian SSR's industrial sector during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The Kuro aparatūros gamykla (Fuel Equipment Factory) is now bankrupt; Sigma, formerly one of the leading manufacturers of electronics and computer components in the Soviet Union, which contributed to the description of the Lithuanian SSR as ""The Soviet Silicon Valley"",[64] continues to operate at a minimum level; and Vilma remains Lithuania's largest manufacturer of electrical products.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai is well-served by Vilnius' bus and trolleybus transportation network. One of Vilnius' trolleybus hubs is located in the northernmost part of Žirmūnai elderate, and Vilniaus Autobusai, Vilnius' main bus operator, is headquartered and has its main depot in Žirmūnai. Žirmūnai suffers from rush hour traffic jams. The street network in the district was primarily designed in the Soviet era for a much lower vehicle traffic.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai is linked to the elderate of Antakalnis by three bridges over the River Neris:  Valakampiai Bridge, the longest bridge in Vilnius, built in 1972; the Šilas Bridge, built in 1999, and Žirmūnai Bridge, built in 1965. The Mindaugas Bridge was built in 2003 to link Žirmūnai with Vilnius' Old Town. Passenger ferry transport on the Neris was active until the 1990s, but is now limited to occasional chartered sightseeing tours from the Mindaugas Bridge to Valakampiai in summer.[citation needed]

For some time in the first half of the 20th century, a narrow-gauge railway traversed Žirmūnai following the approximate course of the modern Minties Street; it crossed over the River Neris on a bridge located near the modern Šilas Bridge, as can be seen in the 1942 map of Vilnius.[26]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Žirmūnai
Lithuanian litas,"The Lithuanian litas (ISO currency code LTL, symbolized as Lt; plural litai (nominative) or litų (genitive) was the currency of Lithuania, until 1 January 2015, when it was replaced by the euro. It was divided into 100 centų (genitive case; singular centas, nominative plural centai). The litas was first introduced on 2 October 1922 after World War I, when Lithuania declared independence, and was reintroduced on 25 June 1993 following a period of currency exchange from the Soviet ruble to the litas with the temporary talonas then in place.[1] The name was modeled after the name of the country (similar to Latvia and its lats). From 1994 to 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1. The litas was pegged to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1 since 2002. The euro was expected to replace the litas by 1 January 2007, but persistent high inflation and the economic crisis delayed the switch.

On 1 January 2015, the litas was switched to the euro at the rate of LTL 3.4528 to 1.[2] Nevertheless, coins and banknotes of the second litas will be exchanged indefinitely into euros by the Bank of Lithuania.[3]

The first litas was introduced on 2 October 1922, replacing the ostmark and ostrubel, both of which had been issued by the occupying German forces during World War I. The ostmark was known as the auksinas in Lithuania.

The litas was established at a value of 10 litų = 1 US dollar and was subdivided into 100-centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the litas appeared to be quite a strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the Lithuanian economy. One litas was covered by 0.150462 grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 litas, backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities.[4] It was required that at least one third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai,[5] rising to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.[6]

In March 1939 Nazi Germany demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaipėda Region (also known as the Memel Territory), which had been detached from Germany after World War I. The Lithuanian government complied, and on 23 March 1939 the area was annexed by Germany.
On the same day the reichsmark replaced the litas as the official currency of the region, with 1 litas being exchanged for 40 pfennig. Until 20 May 1939 inhabitants of the Memelgebiet could exchange litas for reichsmarks.[7]

The litas was replaced by the Soviet ruble in April 1941 after Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union, with 1 litas equal to 0.9 ruble, although the actual value of the litas was about 3 to 5 rubles. Such an exchange rate provided great profit for Soviet military and party officials. Trying to protect the value of the currency, people started to massively buy, which, together with a downfall in production (following nationalization), caused material shortages. Withdrawals were then limited to 250 litų[8] before the litas was completely abolished. In 1941 circulation of litas was completely prohibited.[9]

Coins were introduced in 1925 in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centai, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2, 5-litai, with the litas coins in silver. 10 litų coins were introduced in 1936. All these coins were designed by the sculptor Juozas Zikaras (1881–1944). The litas coins displayed Jonas Basanavičius and Vytautas the Great, which was replaced by a portrait of President Antanas Smetona.

In 1922, the Bank of Lithuania issued notes in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centu, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2 litu, 5 litai, 10, 50, 100 litų. In 1924, 500 and 1000 litų notes were added. Denominations below 5 litai were replaced by coins in 1925.

The litas became Lithuania's currency once more on 25 June 1993, when it replaced the temporary talonas currency at a rate of 1 litas to 100 talonas.

In 1993, banknotes (dated 1991) were issued in denominations of 1 litas, 2, 5 litai, 10, 20, 50, 100 litų. Due to poor designs, these were found to be easily copied and a second series of notes was swiftly introduced in denominations of 1 litas, 2, 5 litai, 10, 20, 50 litų, with only the 100 litų notes of the first series remaining in circulation. 200 litų notes were introduced in 1997, followed by 500 litų in 2000.

In 1993, coins were introduced (dated 1991) in denominations of 1 centas, 2, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2, 5 litai. The 1 centas, 2, 5 centai pieces were minted in aluminium, the 10, 20, 50-centų in bronze and the litas coins were of cupro-nickel. In 1997, nickel-brass 10, 20, 50-centų coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 1 litas, bimetallic 2 and 5 litai in 1998. All had the obverse designs showing the coat of arms in the center and the name of the state ""Lietuva"" in capital letters.

The first coins were minted in the United Kingdom and arrived in Lithuania on 31 October 1990. Later, all coins were minted in the state run ""Lithuanian Mint"", which started its operations in September 1992 and helped to cut the costs of introducing the litas.

Officials started to prepare for the introduction of the litas even before independence was declared, it was thought to introduce the litas alongside the ruble even if Lithuania remained a part of the Soviet Union.[10] In December 1989, artists were asked to submit sketches of possible coin and banknote designs. Also, a list of famous people was compiled in order to determine who should be featured for its currency.

The Bank of Lithuania was established on 1 March 1990. Ten days later, Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union. At first, the Lithuanian government negotiated in vain with François Charles Oberthur, a printing company located in France to print the banknotes. In November 1990, the Bank of Lithuania decided to work with the United States Banknote Corporation (now American Banknote Corporation). In late autumn 1991, the first shipments of litas banknotes and coins arrived in Lithuania.

In November 1991, the Currency Issue Law was passed and the Litas Committee was created. It had the power to fix the date for the litas to come into circulation, the terms for the withdrawal from circulation of the ruble, the exchange rate of the litas and other conditions. Officials waited for a while for the economy to stabilise so as not to expose the young litas to inflation. About 80% of Lithuania's trade was with Russia and the government needed to find a way to smooth the transition away from the ruble zone. Also Lithuania needed to gather funds to form a stabilisation fund.

At first, Lithuania did not have gold or any other securities to back up the litas. Lithuania needed to find about 200 million U.S. dollars to form the stabilisation fund. First, it sought to recover its pre-war gold reserves (about 10 tonnes) from France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, etc. In the interwar period Lithuania stored its gold reserves in foreign banks. After the occupation in 1940 those reserves were deemed ""nobody's"": there was no Lithuania and most Western countries condemned the occupation as illegal and did not recognise the Soviet Union as a successor. The Bank of England, for example, sold the reserves to the Soviets in 1967. However, in January 1992 it announced that this action was a ""betrayal of the people of the Baltic states"" and that it would return the originally deposited amount of gold, now worth about 90 million pounds sterling, to the three Baltic states. Lithuania received 18.5 million pounds or 95,000 ounces of gold and remained a customer of the bank. Similarly, in March 1992 Lithuania reclaimed gold from the Bank of France and later from the Bank of Sweden.

In October 1992, the International Monetary Fund (Lithuania joined this organisation on 29 April 1992) granted the first loan of 23.05 million U.S. dollars[11] to create the stabilisation fund. However, it is estimated that at the time of the introduction of the new currency, Lithuania gathered only $120 million for the stabilisation fund. For a brief while it was kept a secret so as not to further damage the reputation and trust in the litas.

Lietuvos Rytas journalists investigated the production of the litas and found that for a while it was purposely held back. For example, 6 million litas designated to pay for printing the banknotes stayed in a zero interest bearing account for a year in a bank in Sweden. By 1992, the litas was ready for introduction, but the banknotes were of extremely low quality, they could easily be counterfeited with a simple colour printer; especially the 10, 20, and 50 litų banknotes.

Newly elected President Algirdas Brazauskas dismissed the Chair of the Bank of Lithuania, Vilius Baldišis, for incompetence just two months before the introduction of the litas. Baldišis was later charged for negligence that cost Lithuania $3,000,000. Some claim that the Russian secret services were behind the affair. Baldišis' explanation was that he was trying to cut the costs of printing the banknotes and thus did not order better security features. Also, ""U.S. Banknote Corporation"" was accused of violation of the contract terms.[citation needed]

But when the new issue of litas banknotes was redesigned, reprinted, and introduced in June 1993, it was found that the quality of the money was still too low and the banknotes would have to be redesigned further in the future. All these scandals and the small backup of gold reserve (about $120 million instead of $200 million) damaged the reputation of the litas. The newly appointed chair, Romualdas Visokavičius, moved things quickly and won the trust of the public. However, in October he was asked to resign mostly because of his involvement with a private bank ""Litimpex"".

On 25 June 1993, the litas was finally introduced at the rate of 1 litas to 100 talonas. 1 U.S. dollar was worth 4.5 litai and decreased to about 4.2 a couple of weeks later. Even the introduction of the litas was followed by a scandal. The government allowed the changing of unlimited amounts of talonas to the litas without having to show the source of the talonas. This allowed criminal groups to legalize their funds.

In July, circulation of the talonas was stopped and on 1 August 1993, the litas became the only legal tender. Following the reintroduction of the litas, there was an effort to weed out U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by the people and the ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very ""dollarised"" as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.

Due to poor banknote quality (both talonas and early litas) it was easy to counterfeit them. Most shops were forced to acquire ultraviolet lamps to check for forgeries. One group, for example, printed 500 talonas banknotes in Turkey. It is estimated that their notes totaled 140,000 litas.[12]

From 1 April 1994 to 1 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1 (the litas was stable around 3.9 for half a year before the rate was fixed). The main reasons for this fixation was little trust in the emerging monetary system, fear of high fluctuations in currency exchange rates, desire to attract foreign investors, and International Monetary Fund recommendations. The peg was renewable every year. For a while a peg was considered to a basket of currencies: the European Currency Unit. At around this time Lithuania also established a currency board.

Alter successful round of negotiations in 1998 with the European Commission, the idea of aligning with the future currency of European Union. By 1999, the Bank of Lithuania proposed currency board with both US dollar and the euro.

The pegging of the litas and the euro was proposed to be implemented by the second half of 2001.[13]

On 2 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.4528 to 1 (1 LTL = 0.28962 EUR) (it was the rate that the litas and the euro had by the time); this rate was not expected to change – and indeed did not – until the litas was completely replaced by the euro on 1 January 2015.[14] After the peg, Lithuania became a member of the Eurozone de facto. The litas became part of the ERM II on 28 June 2004.[15] the EU's exchange rate mechanism. The design of Lithuanian euro coins had already been prepared.

Lithuania postponed its euro day several times, since the country did not meet the convergence criteria. High inflation—which reached 11% in October 2008, well above the then acceptable limit of 4.2%[16]—contributed to Lithuania's failure to meet the criteria. In 2011, polls showed narrow opposition to the currency.[17] On 23 July 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a decision allowing Lithuania to adopt the euro as its currency on 1 January 2015.[14] Litas and euro were both legal tender in Lithuania until 16 January 2015.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_litas

Lithuanian litas,"The Lithuanian litas (ISO currency code LTL, symbolized as Lt; plural litai (nominative) or litų (genitive) was the currency of Lithuania, until 1 January 2015, when it was replaced by the euro. It was divided into 100 centų (genitive case; singular centas, nominative plural centai). The litas was first introduced on 2 October 1922 after World War I, when Lithuania declared independence, and was reintroduced on 25 June 1993 following a period of currency exchange from the Soviet ruble to the litas with the temporary talonas then in place.[1] The name was modeled after the name of the country (similar to Latvia and its lats). From 1994 to 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1. The litas was pegged to the euro at the rate of 3.4528 to 1 since 2002. The euro was expected to replace the litas by 1 January 2007, but persistent high inflation and the economic crisis delayed the switch.

On 1 January 2015, the litas was switched to the euro at the rate of LTL 3.4528 to 1.[2] Nevertheless, coins and banknotes of the second litas will be exchanged indefinitely into euros by the Bank of Lithuania.[3]

The first litas was introduced on 2 October 1922, replacing the ostmark and ostrubel, both of which had been issued by the occupying German forces during World War I. The ostmark was known as the auksinas in Lithuania.

The litas was established at a value of 10 litų = 1 US dollar and was subdivided into 100-centų. In the face of worldwide economic depression, the litas appeared to be quite a strong and stable currency, reflecting the negligible influence of the depression on the Lithuanian economy. One litas was covered by 0.150462 grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. In March 1923, the circulation amounted to 39,412,984 litas, backed by 15,738,964 in actual gold and by 24,000,000 in high exchange securities.[4] It was required that at least one third of the total circulation would be covered by gold and the rest by other assets. By 1938, 1 U.S. dollar was worth about 5.9 litai,[5] rising to about 20 U.S. cents before its disappearance in 1941.[6]

In March 1939 Nazi Germany demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaipėda Region (also known as the Memel Territory), which had been detached from Germany after World War I. The Lithuanian government complied, and on 23 March 1939 the area was annexed by Germany.
On the same day the reichsmark replaced the litas as the official currency of the region, with 1 litas being exchanged for 40 pfennig. Until 20 May 1939 inhabitants of the Memelgebiet could exchange litas for reichsmarks.[7]

The litas was replaced by the Soviet ruble in April 1941 after Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union, with 1 litas equal to 0.9 ruble, although the actual value of the litas was about 3 to 5 rubles. Such an exchange rate provided great profit for Soviet military and party officials. Trying to protect the value of the currency, people started to massively buy, which, together with a downfall in production (following nationalization), caused material shortages. Withdrawals were then limited to 250 litų[8] before the litas was completely abolished. In 1941 circulation of litas was completely prohibited.[9]

Coins were introduced in 1925 in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centai, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2, 5-litai, with the litas coins in silver. 10 litų coins were introduced in 1936. All these coins were designed by the sculptor Juozas Zikaras (1881–1944). The litas coins displayed Jonas Basanavičius and Vytautas the Great, which was replaced by a portrait of President Antanas Smetona.

In 1922, the Bank of Lithuania issued notes in denominations of 1 centas, 2 centu, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2 litu, 5 litai, 10, 50, 100 litų. In 1924, 500 and 1000 litų notes were added. Denominations below 5 litai were replaced by coins in 1925.

The litas became Lithuania's currency once more on 25 June 1993, when it replaced the temporary talonas currency at a rate of 1 litas to 100 talonas.

In 1993, banknotes (dated 1991) were issued in denominations of 1 litas, 2, 5 litai, 10, 20, 50, 100 litų. Due to poor designs, these were found to be easily copied and a second series of notes was swiftly introduced in denominations of 1 litas, 2, 5 litai, 10, 20, 50 litų, with only the 100 litų notes of the first series remaining in circulation. 200 litų notes were introduced in 1997, followed by 500 litų in 2000.

In 1993, coins were introduced (dated 1991) in denominations of 1 centas, 2, 5 centai, 10, 20, 50-centų, and 1 litas, 2, 5 litai. The 1 centas, 2, 5 centai pieces were minted in aluminium, the 10, 20, 50-centų in bronze and the litas coins were of cupro-nickel. In 1997, nickel-brass 10, 20, 50-centų coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 1 litas, bimetallic 2 and 5 litai in 1998. All had the obverse designs showing the coat of arms in the center and the name of the state ""Lietuva"" in capital letters.

The first coins were minted in the United Kingdom and arrived in Lithuania on 31 October 1990. Later, all coins were minted in the state run ""Lithuanian Mint"", which started its operations in September 1992 and helped to cut the costs of introducing the litas.

Officials started to prepare for the introduction of the litas even before independence was declared, it was thought to introduce the litas alongside the ruble even if Lithuania remained a part of the Soviet Union.[10] In December 1989, artists were asked to submit sketches of possible coin and banknote designs. Also, a list of famous people was compiled in order to determine who should be featured for its currency.

The Bank of Lithuania was established on 1 March 1990. Ten days later, Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union. At first, the Lithuanian government negotiated in vain with François Charles Oberthur, a printing company located in France to print the banknotes. In November 1990, the Bank of Lithuania decided to work with the United States Banknote Corporation (now American Banknote Corporation). In late autumn 1991, the first shipments of litas banknotes and coins arrived in Lithuania.

In November 1991, the Currency Issue Law was passed and the Litas Committee was created. It had the power to fix the date for the litas to come into circulation, the terms for the withdrawal from circulation of the ruble, the exchange rate of the litas and other conditions. Officials waited for a while for the economy to stabilise so as not to expose the young litas to inflation. About 80% of Lithuania's trade was with Russia and the government needed to find a way to smooth the transition away from the ruble zone. Also Lithuania needed to gather funds to form a stabilisation fund.

At first, Lithuania did not have gold or any other securities to back up the litas. Lithuania needed to find about 200 million U.S. dollars to form the stabilisation fund. First, it sought to recover its pre-war gold reserves (about 10 tonnes) from France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, etc. In the interwar period Lithuania stored its gold reserves in foreign banks. After the occupation in 1940 those reserves were deemed ""nobody's"": there was no Lithuania and most Western countries condemned the occupation as illegal and did not recognise the Soviet Union as a successor. The Bank of England, for example, sold the reserves to the Soviets in 1967. However, in January 1992 it announced that this action was a ""betrayal of the people of the Baltic states"" and that it would return the originally deposited amount of gold, now worth about 90 million pounds sterling, to the three Baltic states. Lithuania received 18.5 million pounds or 95,000 ounces of gold and remained a customer of the bank. Similarly, in March 1992 Lithuania reclaimed gold from the Bank of France and later from the Bank of Sweden.

In October 1992, the International Monetary Fund (Lithuania joined this organisation on 29 April 1992) granted the first loan of 23.05 million U.S. dollars[11] to create the stabilisation fund. However, it is estimated that at the time of the introduction of the new currency, Lithuania gathered only $120 million for the stabilisation fund. For a brief while it was kept a secret so as not to further damage the reputation and trust in the litas.

Lietuvos Rytas journalists investigated the production of the litas and found that for a while it was purposely held back. For example, 6 million litas designated to pay for printing the banknotes stayed in a zero interest bearing account for a year in a bank in Sweden. By 1992, the litas was ready for introduction, but the banknotes were of extremely low quality, they could easily be counterfeited with a simple colour printer; especially the 10, 20, and 50 litų banknotes.

Newly elected President Algirdas Brazauskas dismissed the Chair of the Bank of Lithuania, Vilius Baldišis, for incompetence just two months before the introduction of the litas. Baldišis was later charged for negligence that cost Lithuania $3,000,000. Some claim that the Russian secret services were behind the affair. Baldišis' explanation was that he was trying to cut the costs of printing the banknotes and thus did not order better security features. Also, ""U.S. Banknote Corporation"" was accused of violation of the contract terms.[citation needed]

But when the new issue of litas banknotes was redesigned, reprinted, and introduced in June 1993, it was found that the quality of the money was still too low and the banknotes would have to be redesigned further in the future. All these scandals and the small backup of gold reserve (about $120 million instead of $200 million) damaged the reputation of the litas. The newly appointed chair, Romualdas Visokavičius, moved things quickly and won the trust of the public. However, in October he was asked to resign mostly because of his involvement with a private bank ""Litimpex"".

On 25 June 1993, the litas was finally introduced at the rate of 1 litas to 100 talonas. 1 U.S. dollar was worth 4.5 litai and decreased to about 4.2 a couple of weeks later. Even the introduction of the litas was followed by a scandal. The government allowed the changing of unlimited amounts of talonas to the litas without having to show the source of the talonas. This allowed criminal groups to legalize their funds.

In July, circulation of the talonas was stopped and on 1 August 1993, the litas became the only legal tender. Following the reintroduction of the litas, there was an effort to weed out U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by the people and the ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very ""dollarised"" as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.

Due to poor banknote quality (both talonas and early litas) it was easy to counterfeit them. Most shops were forced to acquire ultraviolet lamps to check for forgeries. One group, for example, printed 500 talonas banknotes in Turkey. It is estimated that their notes totaled 140,000 litas.[12]

From 1 April 1994 to 1 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of 4 to 1 (the litas was stable around 3.9 for half a year before the rate was fixed). The main reasons for this fixation was little trust in the emerging monetary system, fear of high fluctuations in currency exchange rates, desire to attract foreign investors, and International Monetary Fund recommendations. The peg was renewable every year. For a while a peg was considered to a basket of currencies: the European Currency Unit. At around this time Lithuania also established a currency board.

Alter successful round of negotiations in 1998 with the European Commission, the idea of aligning with the future currency of European Union. By 1999, the Bank of Lithuania proposed currency board with both US dollar and the euro.

The pegging of the litas and the euro was proposed to be implemented by the second half of 2001.[13]

On 2 February 2002, the litas was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.4528 to 1 (1 LTL = 0.28962 EUR) (it was the rate that the litas and the euro had by the time); this rate was not expected to change – and indeed did not – until the litas was completely replaced by the euro on 1 January 2015.[14] After the peg, Lithuania became a member of the Eurozone de facto. The litas became part of the ERM II on 28 June 2004.[15] the EU's exchange rate mechanism. The design of Lithuanian euro coins had already been prepared.

Lithuania postponed its euro day several times, since the country did not meet the convergence criteria. High inflation—which reached 11% in October 2008, well above the then acceptable limit of 4.2%[16]—contributed to Lithuania's failure to meet the criteria. In 2011, polls showed narrow opposition to the currency.[17] On 23 July 2014, the Council of the European Union adopted a decision allowing Lithuania to adopt the euro as its currency on 1 January 2015.[14] Litas and euro were both legal tender in Lithuania until 16 January 2015.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_litas

History of the Jews in Ukraine,"The history of the Jews in Ukraine dates back over a thousand years; Jewish communities have existed in the modern territory of Ukraine from the time of the Kievan Rus' (late 9th to mid-13th century).[10][11] Important Jewish religious and cultural movements, from Hasidism to Zionism, arose there. According to the World Jewish Congress, the Jewish community in Ukraine is Europe's fourth largest and the world's 11th largest.[3]

At times it flourished, while at other times it faced persecution and anti-Semitic discrimination. In the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–1920), Yiddish became a state language, along with Ukrainian and Russian. At that time, the Jewish National Union was created and the community was granted autonomous status.[12] Yiddish was used on Ukrainian currency between 1917 and 1920.[13] Before World War II, slightly less than one-third of Ukraine's urban population consisted of Jews.[14]

In the westernmost region, Jews were mentioned for the first time in records in 1030. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising between 1648 and 1657, an army of Cossacks massacred and took large numbers of Jews, Roman Catholics, and Uniate Christians into captivity. One estimate (1996) reported that 15,000-30,000 Jews were killed or taken captive, and that 300 Jewish communities were completely destroyed.[15] More recent estimates (2014) report mortality of 3,000-6,000 people between the years 1648–1649.[16]

During 1821 anti-Jewish riots in Odesa followed the death of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch in Constantinople, in which 14 Jews were recorded killed. Some sources claim this episode as the first pogrom.[17] At the start of the 20th century, anti-Jewish pogroms continued, leading to large-scale emigration. In 1915, the imperial Russian government expelled thousands of Jews from the Empire's border areas.[18][19]

During the Russian Revolution and ensuing Civil War, an estimated 31,071 Jews were killed in pogroms between 1918 and 1920.[20] During the Ukrainian People's Republic (1917–21),[21] pogroms continued. In Ukraine, the number of civilian Jews killed by the Ukrainian People's Army under Symon Petliura during the period was estimated at between 35,000 and 100,000.[22]

Pogroms erupted in January 1919 in the northwest province of Volhynia and spread to many other regions[23] and continued until 1921.[24] The actions of the Soviet government by 1927 led to a growing antisemitism.[25]

Total civilian losses in Ukraine during World War II and the German occupation are estimated at seven million. More than one million Soviet Jews, including 225,000 in Belarus,[26] were killed by the Einsatzgruppen and their many Ukrainian supporters. Most of them were killed in Ukraine because most pre-WWII Soviet Jews lived in the Pale of Settlement, of which Ukraine was the biggest part. The major massacres against Jews occurred mainly in the first phase of the occupation, although they continued until the return of the Red Army. In 1959 Ukraine had 840,000 Jews, a decrease of almost 70% from 1941 totals (within Ukraine's current borders). Ukraine's Jewish population continued to decline significantly during the Cold War. In 1989, Ukraine's Jewish population was only slightly more than half of what it was in 1959. During and after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the majority of Jews in 1989 left the country and moved abroad (mostly to Israel).[27] Antisemitism, including violent attacks on Jews, was still a problem in Ukraine in 2012, according to UN report.[28] The country's current president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish.

By the 11th century, Byzantine Jews of Constantinople had familial, cultural, and theological ties with the Jews of Kyiv. For instance, some 11th-century Jews from Kievan Rus participated in an anti-Karaite assembly held in either Thessaloniki or Constantinople.[29] One of the three Kyivan city gates in the times of Yaroslav the Wise was called Zhydovski (Judaic).

In Galicia, Jews were mentioned for the first time in 1030. From the second part of the 14th century, they were subjects of Polish kings and magnates. The Jewish population of Galicia and Bukovina, part of Austria-Hungary, made up 5% of the global Jewish population.

From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in the 10th century through the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, Poland was one of the most diverse countries in Europe. It became home to one of the world's largest and most vibrant Jewish communities. The Jewish community in the territory of Ukraine-proper during the Commonwealth became one of the largest and most important ethnic minority groups in Ukraine.[citation needed]

Ukrainian Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky led a Cossack uprising, known as Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–1657), under the premise that the Poles had sold them as slaves ""into the hands of the accursed Jews."" It is estimated that at that time the Jewish population in Ukraine numbered 51,325.[30] An army of Cossacks massacred and took into captivity numerous Jews, Roman Catholics and Ukrainian Greek Catholics in 1648–49.

A 1996 estimate reports that 15,000-30,000 Jews were killed or taken captive, and that 300 Jewish communities were destroyed.[15] A 2014 estimate reduces the toll to 3,000-6,000 from 1648 to 1649; of these, 3,000-6,000 Jews were killed by Cossacks in Nemirov in May 1648 and 1,500 in Tulczyn in July 1648.[16]

The Cossack Uprising and the Deluge left a deep and lasting impression on Jewish social and spiritual life.[citation needed]

This was a time of mysticism and overly formal rabbinism. The teachings of Israel ben Eliezer, known as the Baal Shem Tov, or BeShT, (1698–1760) had a profound effect on Eastern European Jews.[citation needed] His disciples taught and encouraged a new and fervent brand of Judaism, related to Kabbalah, known as Hasidism. The rise of Hasidism influenced Haredi Judaism, with a continuous influence through many Hasidic dynasties.

A different movement was started by Jacob Frank in the middle of the 18th century. Frank's teachings were unorthodox (such as purification through transgression and adoption of elements of Christianity). He was excommunicated along with his numerous followers. They eventually converted to Catholicism.[31]

The traditional measures used to keep the Russian Empire free of Jews[citation needed] were hindered when the main territory of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was annexed during the partitions of Poland. During the second (1793) and the third (1795) partitions, large populations of Jews were absorbed by the Russian Empire, and Catherine the Great established the Pale of Settlement that included Congress Poland and Crimea.

During 1821 anti-Jewish riots in Odesa after the death of the Greek Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople, 14 Jews were killed. Some sources mark this episode as the first pogrom,[32] while according to others (such as the Jewish Encyclopedia, 1911 ed.) say the first pogrom was an 1859 riot in Odesa. The term became common after a wave of anti-Jewish violence swept the southern Russian Empire (including Ukraine) between 1881 and 1884, after Jews were blamed for the assassination of Alexander II.

In May 1882, Alexander III of Russia introduced temporary regulations called May Laws that remained in effect until 1917. Systematic policies of discrimination, strict quotas on the number of Jews allowed to obtain education and professions caused widespread poverty and mass emigration. In 1886, an edict of Expulsion was applied to Jews in Kyiv. In 1893–1894, some areas of Crimea were removed from the Pale.

When Alexander III died in Crimea on 20 October 1894, according to Simon Dubnow: ""as the body of the deceased was carried by railway to St. Petersburg, the same rails were carrying the Jewish exiles from Yalta to the Pale. The reign of Alexander III began with pogroms and concluded with expulsions.""[33]

Odesa became the home of a large Jewish community during the 19th century, and by 1897 Jews were estimated to account for some 37% of the population.[34]

Jews were over-represented in the Russian revolutionary leadership. However, most were hostile to Jewish culture and Jewish political parties, and were loyal to the Communist Party's atheism and proletarian internationalism, and committed to stamping out any sign of ""Jewish cultural particularism"".

Counter-revolutionary groups, including the Black Hundreds, opposed the Revolution with violent attacks on socialists and pogroms against Jews. A backlash came from the conservative elements of society, notably in spasmodic anti-Jewish attacks – around five hundred were killed in a single day in Odesa. Nicholas II claimed that 90% of revolutionaries were Jews.

At the start of the 20th century, anti-Jewish pogroms continued to occur in cities and towns across the Russian Empire such as Kishinev, Kyiv, Odesa, and many others. Numerous Jewish self-defense groups were organized to prevent the outbreak of pogroms among which the most successful one was under the leadership of Mishka Yaponchik in Odesa.

In 1905, a series of pogroms erupted at the same time as the Revolution against the government of Nicholas II. The chief organizers of the pogroms were the members of the Union of the Russian People (commonly known as the ""Black Hundreds"").[35]

From 1911 to 1913, the antisemitic tenor of the period was characterized by a number of blood libel cases (accusations of Jews murdering Christians for ritual purposes). One of the most famous was the two-year trial of Menahem Mendel Beilis, who was charged with the murder of a Christian boy.[36] The trial was showcased by the authorities to illustrate the perfidy of the Jewish population.[37]

In 1912-1914, S. An-sky led the Jewish Ethnographic Expedition to the Pale, which visited around 70 shtetls in Volyn, Podolia, and Galicia (all in modern Ukraine) gathering folk stories, artifacts, recording music, and making photos, as an attempt to preserve and salvage traditional Ashkenazim culture that was vanishing because of modernization, pogroms, and emigration.

From March to May 1915, in the face of the German army, the government expelled thousands of Jews from the Empire's border areas, mainly the Pale of Settlement.[18][19]

During the 1917 Russian Revolution and the ensuing Russian Civil War, an estimated 70,000 to 250,000 Jewish civilians were killed in atrocities throughout the former Russian Empire. In  modern Ukraine an estimated 31,071 died in 1918–1920.[20]

During the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR, 1917–1921),[21] pogroms continued. In the UPR, Yiddish was an official language,[38] while all government posts and institutions had Jewish members.[38] A Ministry for Jewish Affairs was established (it was the first modern state to do so).[21][38] Rights of Jewish culture were guaranteed.[21] Jewish parties abstained or voted against the Tsentralna Rada's Fourth Universal of 25 January 1918 which was aimed at breaking ties with Bolshevik Russia and proclaiming a sovereign Ukrainian state,[38]  since all Jewish parties were strongly against Ukrainian independence.[38]

In Ukraine alone, the number of civilian Jews killed during the period was estimated to be between 35,000 and 50,000. Archives declassified after 1991 provide evidence of a higher number; in the period from 1918 to 1921, ""according to incomplete data, at least 100,000 Jews were killed in Ukraine in the pogroms.""[39] The Ukrainian People's Republic did issue orders condemning pogroms and attempted to investigate them.[21] But it lacked authority to stop violence.[21] In the last months of its existence it lacked any power to create social stability.[38]

Among the prominent Ukrainian statesmen of this period were Moisei Rafes, Pinkhas Krasny, Abram Revutsky, Moishe Zilberfarb, and many others. (see General Secretariat of Ukraine) The autonomy of Ukraine was openly greeted by the Ukrainian Jewish Volodymyr Zhabotinsky.

Between April and December 1918 the Ukrainian People's Republic was non-existent and overthrown by the Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadsky[21][40] who ended the experiment in Jewish autonomy.[38]

The February 1917 revolution brought a liberal Provisional Government to power in the Russian Empire. On 21 March/3 April, the government removed all ""discrimination based upon ethnic religious or social grounds"".[41] The Pale was officially abolished. The removal of the restrictions on Jews' geographical mobility and educational opportunities led to a migration to the country's major cities.[42]

One week after the 25 October / 7 November 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the new government proclaimed the ""Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples [Nations] of Russia,"" promising all nationalities the rights of equality, self-determination and secession. Jews were not specifically mentioned in the declaration, reflecting Lenin's view that Jews did not constitute a nation.[43]

In 1918, the RSFSR Council of Ministers issued a decree entitled ""On the Separation of Church from State and School from Church"", depriving religious communities of the status of juridical persons, the right to own property and the right to enter into contracts. The decree nationalized the property of religious communities and banned their assessment of religious tuition. As a result, religion could be taught or studied only in private.[44]

On 1 February 1918 the Commissariat for Jewish National Affairs was established as a subsection of the Commissariat for Nationality Affairs. It was mandated to establish the ""dictatorship of the proletariat in the Jewish streets"" and attract the Jewish masses to the regime while advising local and central institutions on Jewish issues. The Commissariat was also expected to fight the influence of Zionist and Jewish-Socialist Parties.[45][46] On 27 July 1918 the Council of People's Commissars issued a decree stating that antisemitism is ""fatal to the cause of the ... revolution"". Pogroms were officially outlawed.[47] On 20 October 1918 the Jewish section of the CPSU (Yevsektsia) was established for the Party's Jewish members; its goals were similar to those of the Jewish Commissariat.[41][48][49][50][51]

During the Hryhoriv Uprising in May 1919, almost 3000 Jews of Yelisavetgrad (today Kropyvnytskyi) were murdered and their property stolen.

In contrast with the Bolshevik government's official policy of equality among citizens, antisemitism remained deeply entrenched in the political and social ideologies of the tsarist counterrevolutionaries, especially among paramilitary groups such as the Black Hundreds. These militias incited and organized pogroms against Russian Jews. The official slogan of the Black Hundreds was ""Bei Zhidov,"" meaning 'Beat the Jews.'[52] Thus, during the Russian Civil War that followed the 1917 Revolution, the Jews became a crucial site of the conflict between revolutionary Reds and counterrevolutionary Whites, particularly in the contested territory of Ukraine. The Bolsheviks' official opposition to antisemitism—coupled with the prominence of Jews such as Leon Trotsky within the Bolshevik ranks—allowed the Christian nationalist movements of both the White Army and the emergent Ukrainian National Republic to link Ukrainian Jews to the despised communism. These connections, combined with the cultural tradition of antisemitism among Russian peasantry,[53] provided ample justification for the Whites to attack Ukraine's Jewish population. Between 1918 and 1921, almost all of the approximately 2,000 pogroms carried out in Ukraine were organized by White Army forces.[54] eyewitnesses reported hearing counterrevolutionary militia members expound slogans such as, ""We beat the Yids, we beat the Commune"", and ""This is the answer to the Bolsheviks for the Red Terror.""[53] Recent studies hold that about 30,000 Jews were killed in these pogroms, while another 150,000 died from wounds sustained during the violence.[54]

The pogroms that erupted in January 1919 in the northwest province of Volhynia spread during February and March to the cities, towns, and villages of many other regions of Ukraine.[23] After Sarny it was the turn of Ovruch, northwest of Kyiv. In Tetiev on 25 March, approximately 4,000 Jews were murdered, half in a synagogue set ablaze by Cossack troops under Colonels Kurovsky, Cherkowsy, and Shliatoshenko.[23] Then Vashilkov (6 and 7 April).[55] In Dubovo (17 June) 800 Jews were decapitated in assembly-line fashion.[23] According to David A. Chapin, the town of Proskurov (now Khmelnitsky), near the city of Sudilkov, ""was the site of the worst atrocity committed against Jews this century before the Nazis."" Pogroms continued until 1921.[24]

On 15 February 1919, during the Ukrainian-Soviet war, Otaman Ivan Semesenko initiated a pogrom Proskurov in which many Jews were massacred on Shabbat (parashah Tesaveh). Semesenko claimed that the pogrom was in retaliation for a previous Bolshevik uprising that he believed was led by Jews.[56]

According to the pinqasim record books those murdered in the pogrom included 390 men, 309 women and 76 children. The number of wounded exceeded 500. Two weeks later Order 131 was published in the central newspaper[clarification needed] by the head of Directorate of Ukraine. In it Symon Petliura denounced such actions and eventually executed Otaman Semesenko by firing-squad in November 1919. Semesenko's brigade was disarmed and dissolved. This event is especially remarkable because it was used to justify Sholem Schwarzbard's assassination of the Ukrainian leader in 1926. Although Petliura's direct involvement was never proven, Schwartzbard was acquitted in revenge. The series of Jewish pogroms around Ukraine culminated in the Kyiv pogroms of 1919 between June and October of that year.[57][58]

In July 1919, the Central Jewish Commissariat dissolved the kehillot (Jewish Communal Councils). The kehillot had provided social services to the Jewish community.[59]

From 1919 to 1920, Jewish parties and Zionist organizations were driven underground as the Communist government sought to abolish all potential opposition.[60][61] The Yevsektsiya Jewish section of the Soviet Communist party was at the forefront of the anti-religious campaigns of the 1920s that led to the closing of religious institutions, the break-up of religious communities and the further restriction of access to religious education.[48] To that end a series of ""community trials"" against the Jewish religion were held. The last known such trial, on the subject of circumcision, was held in 1928 in Kharkiv.[49][50] At the same time, the body worked to establish a secular identity for the Jewish community.[51]

In 1921 many Jews[62] emigrated to Poland, as they were entitled by a peace treaty in Riga to choose the country they preferred. Several hundred thousand joined the already numerous Jewish minority of the Polish Second Republic. Also, during the interwar period, thousands of Jewish refugees from the Soviet Ukraine migrated to Romania.[63][64][65]

On 31 January 1924 the Commissariat for Nationalities' Affairs was disbanded.[66] On 29 August 1924 an official agency for Jewish resettlement, the Commission for the Settlement of Jewish Toilers on the Land (KOMZET), was established. KOMZET studied, managed and funded projects for Jewish resettlement in rural areas.[67][68] A public organization, the Society for the Agricultural Organization of Working Class Jews in the USSR (OZET), was created in January 1925 to help recruit colonists and support the colonization work of KOMZET.[69] For the first few years the government encouraged Jewish settlements, particularly in Ukraine. Support for the project dwindled throughout the next decade.[70] In 1938 OZET was disbanded, following years of declining activity. The Soviets set up three Jewish national raions in Ukraine as well as two in the Crimea – national raions occupied the 3rd level of the Soviet system, but were all disbanded by the end of World War II.[71]

The cities with the largest populations of Jews in 1926 were Odesa, 154,000 or 36.5% of the total population; Kyiv, 140,500 or 27.3%; Kharkiv, 81,500 or 19.5%; and Dnipropetrovsk, 62,000 or 26.7%. In 1931 Lviv's Jewish population numbered 98,000 or 31.9%, and in Chernivtsi, 42,600 or 37.9%.[72]

On 8 April 1929 the new Law on Religious Associations codified all previous religious legislation. All meetings of religious associations were required to have their agenda approved in advance; lists of members of religious associations had to be provided to the authorities.[73] In 1930 the Yevsektsia was dissolved,[51] leaving no central Soviet-Jewish organization. Although the body had served to undermine Jewish religious life, its dissolution led to the disintegration of Jewish secular life as well; Jewish cultural and educational organizations gradually disappeared.[74] When the Soviet government reintroduced the use of internal passports in 1933, ""Jewish"" was considered an ethnicity for those purposes.[75]

The Soviet famine of 1932–1933 affected the Jewish population,[76] and led to a migration from shtetls to overcrowded cities.[77]

As the Soviet government annexed territory from Poland, Romania (both would be incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR after World War II[21]) and the Baltic states,[78] roughly two million Jews became Soviet citizens.[79][80] Restrictions on Jews that had existed in those countries were lifted.[81] At the same time, Jewish organizations in the transferred territories were shut down and their leaders were arrested and exiled.[82] Approximately 250,000 Jews escaped or were evacuated from the annexed territories to the Soviet interior prior to the Nazi invasion.[83]

In 1921, Crimea became an autonomous republic. In 1923, the All-Union Central Committee passed a motion to resettle a large number of the Jewish population from Ukrainian and Belarusian cities to Crimea, numbering 570,400 families. The plan to further resettle Jewish families was confirmed by the Central Committee of the USSR on 15 July 1926, assigning 124 million roubles to the task and also receiving 67 million from foreign sources.[84]

The Soviet initiative of Jewish settlement in Crimea was opposed by Symon Petliura,[85] who regarded it as a provocation. This train of thought was supported by Arnold Margolin[86] who stated that it would be dangerous to set up Jewish colonies there.

The Soviets twice sought to establish Jewish autonomy in Crimea; once, in the 1920s, with the support of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and again in 1944, by the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee.[25][87]

The total number of civilians who died during the war and the German occupation of Ukraine is estimated to be as high as seven million. This estimate includes over one million Jews who were shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen and local Ukrainian collaborators.[88] The excuse of ""Jewish Bolshevism"" was also used to carry them out.[89][90]

The total number of Jews killed in the Holocaust in Eastern Ukraine, or the Ukrainian SSR (within its 1938 borders), is estimated to be slightly less than 700,000 out of a total pre-Holocaust Jewish population of slightly over 1.5 million.[91] Within the borders of Modern Ukraine, the death toll is estimated to be around 900,000.

Ukraine had 840,000 Jews in 1959, a decrease of almost 70% from 1941 (within Ukraine's current borders). Ukraine's Jewish population declined significantly during the Cold War. In 1989, Ukraine's Jewish population was only slightly more than half of what it had been in 1959.

Such immigrants included artists, such as Marina Maximilian Blumin and street artist Klone,[102] as well as activists including Gennady Riger and Lia Shemtov.

In 1989, a Soviet census counted 487,000 Jews living in Ukraine.[103][104] Although discrimination by the state all but halted after Ukrainian independence in 1991, Jews were still discriminated against during the 1990s.[105] For instance, Jews were not allowed to attend some educational institutions.[105] Antisemitism has since declined.[106]

The overwhelming majority of the Jews who remained in Ukraine in 1989 then moved to other countries in the 1990s during and after the collapse of Communism.[27] By 1999 there were various Ukrainian Jewish organizations that disputed each other's legitimacy.[107]

Some 266,300 Ukrainian Jews emigrated to Israel in the 1990s.[106] The 2001 Ukrainian Census counted 106,600 Jews living in Ukraine[108] (the number of Jews also dropped due to a negative birthrate).[106] According to the Public Diplomacy and Diaspora Affairs Minister of Israel, early 2012 there were 250,000 Jews in Ukraine, half of them living in Kyiv.[9] According to the European Jewish Congress, as of 2014, 360,000–400,000 Jews remained.[101]

In November 2007, an estimated 700 Torah scrolls confiscated from Jewish communities during the Soviet era were returned to Jewish communes by state authorities.[109]

The Ukrainian Jewish Committee was established in 2008 in Kyiv to concentrate the efforts of Jewish leaders in Ukraine on resolving the community's strategic problems and addressing socially significant issues. The Committee declared its intention to become one of the world's most influential organizations protecting the rights of Jews and ""the most important and powerful structure protecting human rights in Ukraine"".[110]

In the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary elections, All-Ukrainian Union ""Svoboda"" won its first seats in the Ukrainian Parliament,[111][112][113][114][115][116] garnering 10.44% of the popular vote and the fourth most seats among national political parties;[117][118] This led to concern among Jewish organizations that accused ""Svoboda"" of Nazi sympathies and antisemitism.[119][111][112][113][120][115][116][121] In May 2013, the World Jewish Congress listed the party as neo-Nazi.[122] ""Svoboda"" has denied the charges.[112][123][124][125][126][127][128]

Antisemitic graffiti and violence against Jews were still a problem in 2010.[129]

After the Euromaidan protests, unrest gripped southern and eastern Ukraine, and this escalated in April 2014 into the war in Donbas[130] and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In April 2014, in the city of Donetsk occupied by Russian-backed forces, leaflets were distributed by three masked men as people left a synagogue, ordering Jews to register to avoid losing their property and citizenship ""given that the leaders of the Jewish community of Ukraine support the Banderite junta in Kyiv[a] and are hostile to the Orthodox Donetsk Republic and its citizens"".[131][132][133] After the distribution of the flyers was reported, Denis Pushilin, whom the leaflets claimed had issued the discriminatory order, denied any involvement on behalf of himself and the government of the Donetsk People's Republic. The chief rabbi of the city of Donetsk, Pinchas Vishedski, later called the distribution of the flyers a ""hoax"" that was carried out by an unknown party, adding ""I think it's someone trying to use the Jewish community in Donetsk as an instrument in this conflict. That's why we're upset.""[131]

After the Euromaidan, the number of Ukrainian Jews making aliyah from Ukraine grew 142% during the first four months of 2014 compared to the previous year.[134] 800 people arrived in Israel over January–April, and over 200 signed up for May 2014.[134] However, chief rabbi and Chabad emissary of Kyiv Rabbi Jonathan Markovitch said in late April 2014 ""Today, you can come to Kyiv, Dnipro or Odesa and walk through the streets openly dressed as a Jew, with nothing to be afraid of"".[135]

In August 2014, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported that the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews was organizing chartered flights to allow at least 150 Ukrainian Jews to immigrate to Israel in September. Jewish organizations within Ukraine, as well as the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish Agency for Israel and the Jewish community of Dnipropetrovsk, arranged temporary homes and shelters for hundreds of Jews who fled the war in Donbas in eastern Ukraine. Hundreds of Jews reportedly fled the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk.[136][137]

In 2014 Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Volodymyr Groysman were appointed Governor of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and Speaker of the Parliament respectively.[138][139][140][141] Groysman became Prime Minister of Ukraine in April 2016.[142]

Ukraine elected its first Jewish president in the 2019 presidential election, when then-comedian, head of Kvartal 95 Studio, and lead actor in the TV series Servant of the People Volodymyr Zelenskyy defeated incumbent Petro Poroshenko with 73.23% of the vote, the biggest landslide victory in the history of Ukrainian presidential elections.[143] During the brief overlap of Zelenskyy's and Groysman's terms (20 May to 29 August 2019), Ukraine was the only country in the world apart from Israel to have both a Jewish president and prime minister.[143][144][145]

Ukraine is a major exporter of handmade matzah to the United States.[146][147]

In February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. The Israeli Embassy stayed open on the Sabbath to facilitate the evacuation of Jews. A total of 97 Jews chose to travel to Israel.[148] In addition, 140 Jewish orphans fled to Romania and Moldova.[149][150] 100 Jews fled to Belarus in order to prepare for their eventual move to Israel.[151] On 2 March 2022, the Jewish Agency for Israel reported that hundreds of Jewish war refugees sheltering in Poland, Romania and Moldova were scheduled to leave for Israel the following week.[152] Refugee estimates ranged from 10,000[153] to 15,200 refugees had arrived in Israel.[154] In September 2023 it was reported that over 43,000 Jews from Russia and over 15,000 Jews from Ukraine have fled to Israel.[155] By August 2024, out of an estimated 30,000 Jews who immigrated to Israel since 7 October 2023, 17,000 Jews were from Russia and 900 Jews from Ukraine.[156]

On 22 August 2024, Israeli Ynet news reported that at least 100 Jewish Ukrainian soldiers had been killed fighting Russia since the beginning of the invasion.[157]

As of 2012, Ukraine had the fifth-largest Jewish community in Europe and the twelfth-largest in the world, behind South Africa and ahead of Mexico. The majority live in Kyiv (about half),[9] Dnipro, Kharkiv and Odesa.[158] Rabbis Jonathan Markovitch of Kyiv and Shmuel Kaminetsky[159] of Dnipro are considered to be among the most influential foreigners in the country.[160] Opened in October 2012 in Dnipro, the multifunctional Menorah center is among the world's largest Jewish community centers.[161][162]

A growing trend among Israelis is to visit Ukraine on a ""roots trip"" to learn of Jewish life there.[163] Kyiv is usually mentioned, where it is possible to trace the paths of Sholem Aleichem and Golda Meir; Zhytomyr and Korostyshiv, where one can follow the steps of Haim Nahman Bialik; Berdychiv, where one can trace the life of Mendele Mocher Sforim; Rivne, where one can follow the course of Amos Oz; Buchach – the path of S.Y. Agnon; Drohobych – the place of Maurycy Gottlieb and Bruno Schulz.[163]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Ukraine
Lithuania–Poland border,"The Lithuania–Poland border is the state border between the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Poland. The length of the border is 104 kilometres (65 mi).[1][2] It runs from the Lithuania–Poland–Russia tripoint southeast to the Belarus–Lithuania–Poland tripoint. It is an internal border of the European Union and the Schengen Zone.

It is the only land border that one of the Baltic states (which are members of the EU and NATO) shares with a country that is not a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[3]

In medieval times, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had a vast and often changing border.[4] From the Union of Lublin (1569) to the Partitions of Poland, there was no Polish-Lithuanian border, as both countries were a part of a single federated entity, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[5] During the partitions of Poland era, there were borders between the Congress Poland (Augustów Voivodeship) and territory seized by the Russian Empire (Kovno Governorate and Vilna Governorate). A different border existed between the Second Polish Republic and Lithuania in the period of 1918–1939. Following the Polish–Lithuanian War, from 1922 onward it was stable and had a length of 521 km.[6][7] Suwałki Agreement (1920) established the demarcation line through the Suwałki Region and for the most part it remains the border between Poland and Lithuania in modern times.[8][9] The current border was established in the aftermath of World War II.

In the Suwałki County the settlement of Mejszeszki, located north-west of the town of Wiżajny, was incorporated into Poland. To the north-east of Wiżajny, near the village of Laskowskie, the Lithuanian settlement of Auksztokalnia reached Poland. The border ran the same as in 1939. The area of the commune was inhabited by Lithuanian people. In the Kadaryszki commune, Poland was allocated 4 hectares of land, and changes to the border zone were minimal. Then the border ran through the Zaboryszki commune. In its area, in the town of Trampole, one farm was transferred to Poland. In the Serwy commune, near the village of Wołyńce, 3 pieces of land with an area of 0.5 ha were transferred from Poland to Lithuania. On Gaładuś Lake an island left Poland, in the Giby Commune the following settlements handed over from Poland to the Lithuanian SSR: Kalety, Studzianka, Kodzie, Wolka Rzędowa, Rynkowie, Dąbrowka, Czortek. The border was demarcated without considering elementary economic principles. It resulted in the separation of most agricultural land from habitats and, in some cases, divided habitats. It was planned to create a security belt within a radius of 20 km from the border, from which all national minorities would be removed and repopulated with repatriates. This was intended to prevent the Belarusian population from crossing the border illegally. A similar conclusion was made in the Sokółka County. In Augustów County, the population supported border changes. In Suwałki County, the District Plenipotentiary for delimitation stated that Lithuanians living in the areas which were annexed to Poland were hostile to the authorities and should be removed abroad.[10]

In August 1948, the TASS agency announced a communication on the completion of delimitation of the border. However, the local authorities determined the final shape of the border and belonging of individual villages or their fragments for more than a year and a half. The border since runs along the Marycha River and the current Polish-Lithuanian border, from the point on Marycha, 2 kilometers below the site, to the point where the territories of the Polish and Lithuanian SSR and the area of former East Prussia near the hamlet of Gromadczyzna meet (54.36081715,22.79983067), over a distance of approximately 102 kilometers from a deviation from the previously mentioned border at the village of Graużyny to the north and at the town of Misiszki to the south and a few minor straightening (border posts no. 1789 to 1987), leaving on the Polish side the following settlements: Pozasko, Budwiec, Markiszki, Hołyny, Rachelany, Burbiszki, Borysówka, Poluńce, Berżniki, Wołyńce, Krejwiany, Trompoliszki, Wojciuliszki, Jegliniec, Budzisko, Majdan, Kopowo, Smolnica, Poszeszupie, Butowszczyzna, Krejwiany, Ejszeryszki, Wilkupie, Olszanka Stakuny, Burniszki, Grzybina and Gromadczyna and an island on Lake Gałdauś. The following settlements remained on the Lithuanian (then part of the Soviet Union) side:[10] Helenowo, Ustronie, Podbuwieć, Subacze, Kuciony, Okmiany, Kalwiszki, Tarnówka, Barwisze, Uździenniki, Gralińce, Bielańce, Kibarty, Polance, Buraki, Olkszniany, Giłujsze, Trompole, Zegaryszki, Grungliszki, Durpiej, Czarna Buda, Wołkowizna, Kamionka, Rykosieje, Lubowo, Nowosady, Barwisze, Wartele, Auksztokalne, Ogliniszki, Poszyrwinty, Misiszki and Okszyszki and two islands on Lake Gaładuś. The border crossed the settlement of Graużyny and a number of lakes, in particular Lake Walenicze, Gaładuś, Graużyny (54.3916637 22.9444432) Durajewo and Olgiel up to the tri-point border between Poland, Lithuania and Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) at 54.3633455, 22.79200182.

The border has since remained identical during the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states as well as after the restoration of the independence of Lithuania on 11 March 1990.[11][12][13] On 5 March 1996, both countries signed a treaty on the common border, confirming its status and demarcation, as well as agreeing on the technical cooperation.[14]

Lithuania and Poland joined the Schengen Area in 2007. This meant that all border checkpoints were removed along the border in December 2007, allowing unrestricted border crossing.

On 26 February 2023 Lithuanian customs reinstated third party cargo check points at the Lithuania–Poland border, due increased cargo freight from non-EU countries via Poland and Lithuania to Belarus.[15][16]

To the military planners of NATO, the border area is known as the Suwałki Gap (named after the nearby town of Suwałki) because it represents a military difficulty. It is a flat narrow piece of land, a gap, that is between Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad exclave and that connects the three NATO-member Baltic States to Poland and the rest of NATO.[17] In the event of a Russian attack, the Suwałki Gap would for Russia be important both for connecting Kaliningrad to the rest of Russia, and to prevent military assistance from the other NATO countries to reach the Baltic countries.

In July 2016, two years after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the beginning of the War in Donbass, NATO's member states agreed at the 2016 Warsaw summit to what would become known as the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence.[18][19][20]

A July 2017 NATO exercise was for the first time focused on defense of the gap from a possible Russian attack,[18] and used troops and materiel from US, British, Polish, Lithuanian and Croatian sources.[19]

In September 2017, Russia and Belarus produced the Zapad 2017 exercise.

In the period 1991–2007, there were three road and one rail border crossing between Poland and Lithuania.[21]

On 1 May 2004, when both Poland and Lithuania joined the European Union, this border became an internal border of the European Union.[22] On 21 December 2007, Poland and Lithuania acceded to the Schengen Agreement.[23] After this, crossing the border became easier, as EU internal borders are open to all traffic with little need for control. There are still, however, occasional customs and police controls against smuggling of restricted goods; these  affect only about 1% of travelers.[24][25][26]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania–Poland_border

Žirmūnai,"Žirmūnai (pronounced [ʑɪrˈmuːnɐi] ⓘ) is the most populous administrative division (elderate) in Vilnius. It is also a neighbourhood in the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius, encompassing the city district of the same name, built in the 1960s.

Žirmūnai's history has been traced to the late 14th century, when a Lithuanian fishing village was founded across the River Neris from Vilnius' Old Town.[2] Several historic sites in Žirmūnai are internationally significant; it is the home of Lithuania's largest Jewish cemetery, as well as the location of mass graves of soldiers belonging to Napoleon's Grande Armée and victims of the NKGB's and MGB's executions after World War II.[3][4] Tuskulėnai Manor, built in 1825, and the surrounding Peace Park  are important historical and cultural attractions in Vilnius.[citation needed]

The area was given the name Žirmūnai during the early 1960s, when it became the site of an award-winning residential construction project; it was the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at the time. The massive Palace of Concerts and Sports and Žalgiris Stadium are other relics of Žirmūnai's Soviet history.[5] Žirmūnai was important to the industrial sector in the USSR; since that time, this function has been replaced or supplanted by newer businesses, including some of Lithuania's leading companies.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai has undergone major renovation and development in the 21st century. Šiaurės miestelis (""North Town"") is an area of Žirmūnai that has rapidly evolved into one of the key business and residential districts of the city. This quarter was used by a number of regimes as a military garrison, and internationally significant historical findings have been made in the area.[citation needed]

The Žirmūnai elderate occupies 5.7 km2 or 1.4% of the total area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The elderate extends for about 4.4 kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5 kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai elderate is only some 450 metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in the centre of the city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary is defined by the following streets (from north to south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary.[6] Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.[citation needed]

Despite the proximity of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline,[7] the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.[citation needed]

The Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris, from a point near Žirmūnai Bridge and continuing downstream, was stabilised during the 1980s with a steeply-sloped concrete net-like structure which includes patches of grass between the ""webbing"" of the net; the lower part of the fortification is a concrete tiled walkway, ending just over 4 kilometres downstream, beyond Liubartas Bridge in Žvėrynas. The walkway is used extensively by walkers, joggers, and cyclists, as well as providing seating for anglers. Construction vehicles sometimes use it to reach work areas. The walkway is submerged during the river floods, mostly in springtime.[citation needed]

As of the census taken in April 2001, the ethnic makeup of Žirmūnai was 59.2% Lithuanian, 16.8% Russian (the third highest percentage among Vilnius' elderates, behind Naujoji Vilnia and Naujininkai), 14.4% Poles, 3.8% Belarusian, 1.7% Ukrainian, 0.8% Jewish, 0.2% Tatar, 0.1% Latvian, 0.1% Armenian, and 2.9% other or unspecified ethnicity.[8]

According to the 2001 census, Žirmūnai was the most populous elderate in Vilnius (47,410 residents, comprising 8.7% of Vilnius' total population[9]) and the third most populous in Lithuania after Šilainiai and Dainava, Kaunas. The population density was 8,317.5/km2. According to the census, there were 21,363 private households in the Žirmūnai elderate,[8] making for an average household size of about 2.2 persons. The population of Žirmūnai has been rapidly increasing, largely due to construction of residential buildings in the Šiaurės miestelis section of the elderate. A former elder of Žirmūnai estimated its 2002 population to be about 60,000 residents – an increase of about 13,000 over the 2001 census figure. This rapid growth has placed a strain on city services.[10]

Žirmūnai is occasionally described as a ""borough of elderly people"" or even a ""borough of elderly women"". There is a certain statistical basis to the claim: according to the data of the April 2001 census,[11] only about 43.5% of Žirmūnai's population were male, the second lowest percentage in Vilnius, after Žvėrynas (43.1%); 27.4% of the population (33.2% of women and 19.9% of men)[8] were of legal retirement age, which was 57.5 years for women and 61.5 years for men at the time. This is the highest percentage in Vilnius; accordingly, Žirmūnai had the lowest percentage of residents that were statistically of working age (defined as over age 15 and up to the retirement age) in Vilnius, only 56.4% in total: 52.8% of women and 61.1% of men.[citation needed]

The heavy proportion of elderly persons in the district may be attributed to the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed male–female ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.[12]

At the time of the 2001 census, persons aged between 0 and 15 years comprised 16.1% of Žirmūnai's population, the second lowest percentage among Vilnius' elderates, slightly higher than Viršuliškės at 15.5%.  However, it is likely that the average age of Žirmūnai's residents has decreased since the last census, and will continue to decrease, as a result of the active construction of new dwellings, which are acquired primarily by younger people. As housing prices rise, retirees are motivated to sell their apartments with the goal of acquiring cheaper housing elsewhere with funds to spare.[citation needed]

In 2005, 2,317 crimes were registered in the Žirmūnai elderate.  This is the third highest figure among Vilnius' elderates, behind the Old Town and Naujamiestis.  Using the population data of the latest available census (2001), this would amount to about 48.9 crimes per 1,000 residents per year (only the eighth highest figure, due to the elderate's large population; Vilnius' total crime rate, using the same population data, would be about 51 crimes per 1,000 residents).  In terms of crime density, 406.5 crimes per 1 square kilometre were registered (the fourth highest figure, behind the Old Town, Naujamiestis and Šnipiškės; Vilnius' total crime density, using the same population data, would be about 70.4).[13]

However, thanks largely to the crime prevention programme Saugus miestas (""Safe City""), crime rates in Žirmūnai, as in all other elderates of Vilnius, are declining. For instance, 886 crimes were registered in Žirmūnai during the first four months of 2005, versus 672 during the same period of 2006, a decline of about 24%.[13] If this trend continues, Žirmūnai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents.[citation needed]

The most frequently registered crimes during the first four months of 2006 were: theft (335 instances, including 19 car thefts, constituting about 50% of the total number of crimes); rape (259 instances or about 38.5% of the total); robbery (44 instances or about 6.5%); and bodily injury (20 instances or about 3%). Percentage data may overlap as one criminal act may have several features, which are registered separately, but the total number of crimes is calculated per incident.[13]

The elderate of Žirmūnai embraces three historical suburbs of Vilnius: Žvejai, Tuskulėnai and Šiaurės miestelis. Fishing village Žvejai dating to the 14th century included the only glass factory in the 16th century Lithuania, as well as the largest Jewish cemetery. It became an integral part of Vilnius in the 16th century. The area south of Žvejai became known after the name of the Tusculanum Manor. Manor itself was a property of noble families and officials, and is the oldest building in Žirmūnai. In the 19th century, a military garrison was established in  the present-day Šiaurės miestelis, which was used by Russian, French and Polish armies. These territories were consolidated into Vilnius city during the  period of rapid growth that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. The Tuskulėnai Manor was used as the KGB officers' apartments back then. In the last years, a housing renovation program was launched in Žirmūnai. Military structures in Šiaurės miestelis of a historical value have been preserved and restored. Šiaurės miestelis became one of the most sought–after residential and commercial areas of Vilnius.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai's southernmost section, which lies on the bank of the River Neris opposite the Vilnius Castle Complex, was part of the settlement known as Žvejai; another part of that settlement is now located within the elderate of Šnipiškės. According to archaeological surveys from 2005, a fishing village may have been located here as early as the late 14th century, giving the area its name, literally, Fishermen; it was later settled by craftsmen and housed the Orthodox Church of St Barbara.[2] During the 16th century, the only glass factory in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was located in the suburb of Žvejai.[14] In 1563, after the construction of the first bridge over the River Neris (at the approximate location of today's Mindaugas Bridge), the suburb of Žvejai became an integral part of the city of Vilnius.[14] During Tsarist rule in the 19th century, the name of Žvejai was superseded by that of Piramont, originating from the small estate of Piramont in the area (now Kalvarijų 1).[15] Piramontskij Alley can be seen in a 1904 map of Vilnius[16] where today's A. Juozapavičiaus Street in the elderate of Šnipiškės is located, close to the boundary of Žirmūnai. The usage of Piramont as a placename gradually became limited to the southern part of Žvejai.[citation needed]

The heritage of Žvejai was retained in the name of Žvejų (""Fishermen's"") Street, which runs alongside the River Neris in southern Šnipiškės and Žirmūnai. However, the Žirmūnai section of this street was renamed Olimpiečių (""Olympians"") in 2000 to commemorate the achievements of Lithuanian Olympic athletes in the Sydney Olympics.[17]

The largest and oldest Jewish cemetery in Lithuania, first mentioned in 1592, was also located in Žvejai. It was known in the local Jewish community as Shnipishok.[18] The Yiddish placename later became associated with the whole borough of Šnipiškės, now bordering Žirmūnai on the west. Although the cemetery was officially closed in 1830 and was subject to gradual deterioration, there were further interments. Vilna Gaon, as well as other famous Vilnian Jews, were interred in the cemetery.[citation needed]

During the years of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in the area on the right bank of the River Neris opposite the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Antakalnis, a Royal Manor called Derevnictva (Polish: Derewnictwo), was established in the mid-16th century by King Sigismund Augustus as an outpost of the Vilnius Castles. The manor was held by the kings Sigismund III Vasa and Władysław IV Vasa, nobleman M. Piegłowski, the Wołowicz family, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania Michał Kazimierz Pac, as well by the Tyzenhaus family after 1741. In the mid-18th century, Lateran monks acquired the manor and named it Tusculanum, after the resort outside the ancient Roman city of Tusculum.[19] (see also: Villa Rufinella) The surrounding forests were used as a game reserve and for sport fishing. Towards the end of the century, the manor was separated into the folwarks of Tuskulėnai, based on the core of the old royal manor, and Derevnictva.[20]

Under the rule of the Russian Empire in the 19th century, the Tuskulėnai Manor was held by various noble families and high-ranking state officials, including Governor General of Lithuanian–Vilna Governorate, Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov. In the mid-19th century the main palace was transformed into a guesthouse that became a cultural center in Vilnius, often visited by Stanislaw Moniuszko and Józef Ignacy Kraszewski.[21] The manor passed into the possession of Julija Safranovich after 1886, and then was held by Olga Melentjeva and her noble family until World War II.[citation needed]

The area surrounding Tuskulėnai Manor was referred to as Tuskulėnai (Russian: Tuskuljany;[16] Polish: Tuskulanum)[22] until World War II. This area was also known as Losiovka or Losiuvka, colloquially named after A. Losev, colonel of Special Corps of Gendarmes and later general of the Russian Empire, who owned the folwark of Tuskulėnai in 1869. The placenames are associated primarily with individual wooden houses, built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some of which are still scattered among the apartment buildings.[23]

A military garrison was built in the approximate location of the modern Šiaurės miestelis (""North Town"", that is, north of Old Vilnius) section of Žirmūnai by the Russian Empire during the 19th century. This area went on to be used as a garrison by a number of armies: Napoleon's Grande Armée in 1812, Tsarist for the rest of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century (see: the 27th infantry division's camp in the map of 1904[16]), the Bolsheviks during World War I, the Polish army in the inter-war period, and the Red Army from the 1950s to 1992.[citation needed]

During the interwar period, when Vilnius was under Polish control, the southern part of Žvejai was known as Pióromont;[22] the entire Žvejai area was referred to as Rybaki (Polish for ""Fishermen""); modern Šiaurės miestelis had been called Plac broni (Polish for the ""Military training ground""); and the old placename of Derewnictwo, dating back to the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, applied to the area north of Tuskulėnai Manor.[24]

A map of Vilnius published in 1942, while the city was under Nazi rule, shows the northern part of Žirmūnai as Paneriškės,[25] the middle section as Kareiviškės (""place of soldiers"") and the southern part, close to the Tuskulėnai Manor, as Mantiškės (""a place named in honour of Mantas""). One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas (Herkus Monte), a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising; today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Šnipiškės elderate ending at the boundary of Žirmūnai.[26]

A Soviet military base was established in the current Šiaurės miestelis section of Žirmūnai during the 1950s. The heavily wooded northernmost part of the elderate was thinly populated until the 1960s.[citation needed]

During the 1960s, Žirmūnai attracted the attention of urban planners; it became the first city district in the Lithuanian SSR to be constructed applying urban planning concepts established in the USSR at that time. Designed in 1962, the district consisted of three microdistricts – residential and industrial sections centred around public facilities and had been the largest residential area in the city.[citation needed]

The first microdistrict, or ""Žirmūnai I"", which is district's middle section, was built in 1962—67 in accordance with a project by architect Birutė Kasperavičienė, who was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1968, together with architect Bronislovas Krūminis and engineers Ṧmuelis Liubeckis and Vaclovas Zubras;[27] it was the first time this award had been presented to the designers of a large-scale residential construction. The second microdistrict, ""Žirmūnai II"", which is the southernmost of the three, was built in 1964—68, its architect being Nijolė Chlomauskienė. And the third, the northernmost microdistrict, ""Žirmūnai III"" designed by architect Laima Burneikienė was built in 1964—69 in the site of the former village of Paneriškės.[28] The city district was then named after the formerly Lithuanian[29] village of Žirmūnai (Zhirmuny), now situated 16 kilometres from the Lithuania–Belarus border in the Voranauski District, Hrodna province of Belarus. This village is where Karol Podczaszyński, an architect and designer of Tuskulėnai Manor, was born. Hence the future district's major street Žirmūnų was named after the village as it is seen in the map of 1942[26] and gave its name to the entire district.[clarification needed]

The new residential housing in the microdistrict consisted almost exclusively of five-story prefabricated concrete block apartment buildings popularly known as khrushchyovkas. Three nine-story high-rise apartment buildings were built in 1969, and several more were constructed later, as well as seven brick-built twelve-storeys. The apartment buildings were meant primarily to accommodate industrial workers who came to Vilnius from other regions of the Lithuanian SSR and from other Soviet Republics. They typify the Brutalist architecture of the era. The principles governing the design of the microdistrict were set forth in books by the University of Moscow planners, for instance in New Element of Populating. En Route to the New City published in the USSR in 1966[30] (although the concept of the ""new element"" has been dated to 1959[31]); the book was later published as The Ideal Communist City in the United States, United Kingdom and Italy.[32] According to the book, the optimal apartment size was about 600 square feet (56 square metres), with one bathroom and two bedrooms. Single-family homes were considered ""too 
autonomous"".[33]

The ancient Jewish cemetery in Žvejai stood in the way of the expansion. Many tombstones were destroyed in 1950 during the construction of Žalgiris Stadium; the cemetery was completely demolished in 1955 in accordance with a decree issued by local authorities in 1948.[2] The bodies of Vilna Gaon and several members of his immediate family were relocated, after receiving special permission from the Soviet authorities; this relocation has been the subject of historical controversy.[34] The cemetery was the subject of an archaeological survey in the late 1990s. A memorial stone was placed in the southeastern portion of the former cemetery with an inscription in Yiddish and Lithuanian, stating that the cemetery was established there in 1478 (this dating is disputed).[citation needed]

An incident in Žirmūnai's history that has been difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris,[35] that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.[citation needed]

Tuskulėnai Manor had been nationalised in 1940 and was later used as KGB officers' apartments and as a kindergarten. During excavations that took place between 1994 and 1996 in its territory, the remains of 706 bodies were found; 40 were identified.[36] The area had been used to hide the bodies of Lithuanian residents – mostly resistance fighters against the Soviet occupation and Nazi collaborators – who had been executed by the NKGB and MGB in the Vilnius' KGB Palace between 1944 and 1947 but also those who died fighting Polish Armia Krajowa soldiers. The remains from the mass grave were placed in a columbarium built underground, beneath an artificial hill, and consecrated in 2004.[citation needed]

In 2001, workers laying telephone line in Šiaurės miestelis, near the former garrison, discovered a mass grave that was found to contain the bodies of about 2,000 soldiers – the remnants of Napoleon's Grande Armée as it retreated from Moscow. In December 1812, temperatures in Vilnius had sunk to −30 °C, and the frozen ground made proper burials impossible. The Grande Armée at that time comprised French, Portuguese, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Spaniards, and Croats, as well as Lithuanians and Poles.[4] The bones have been intensively studied by forensic pathologists; DNA evidence showed that many of the deaths were caused by typhus.[37] Most of the remains were re-interred in Antakalnis Cemetery. Other findings included buttons stamped with Napoleon's image, crucifixes, wedding rings, belt buckles, boots and pieces of French uniforms. Footage from the location has been used in the TV series Moments in Time produced by Discovery Channel[38] and Meet the Ancestors[39] by BBC.[40] The archaeological surveys were partially sponsored by the producers.[41]

The Red Army military base in Žirmūnai was abandoned in 1992, a few years after Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union; a grace period was granted in order to ensure the orderly resettlement of the soldiers and their families.[citation needed]

Due to the Soviet principles of urban planning, Žirmūnai, according to the 2001 census data, was among the three Vilnius elderates (the other two being Karoliniškės and Viršuliškės) with the lowest percentage of single-family housing in the city (0.1%). Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments.[42] The scarcity of lots means that the number of single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, there were only a few modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai's housing, especially in its central sections, is in need of extensive renovation, due to wear and tear of its low or medium-quality construction. A program to renew old apartment buildings (including the installation of better insulation) is ongoing in Vilnius, partially assisted by the Vilnius City Municipality; the first finished renovation project – a completely renewed 60-apartment building built in 1965 – is located in Žirmūnai.[43] The area is, in some ways, analogous to public housing districts in Chicago and London; although much of the housing was quickly and inexpensively erected in the 1960s, its proximity to downtown Vilnius, its transportation infrastructure, and its access to the River Neris account for its popularity. The principles of Soviet urban planning that led to its growth have converged with the modern concept of ""Smart growth"".[citation needed]

The Šiaurės miestelis section of Žirmūnai is growing rapidly and in 2007 was one of Vilnius' most sought-after residential and commercial areas.[citation needed]

Many of the military structures that were built in the late 19th century in Šiaurės miestelis have been preserved and restored. Meanwhile, much of the construction that was not deemed to be of permanent value, erected during the Soviet times, has been demolished, leaving room for new streets and housing. The combination of military heritage sites and newer construction is a distinctive feature of Šiaurės miestelis.[citation needed]

Reflecting its military history, numerous street names in and around Šiaurės miestelis allude to military concepts, including Kareivių (""Soldiers""), Lakūnų (""Pilots""), Žygio (""March""), Apkasų (""Trenches""), Ulonų (""Light Cavalry""). The new streets built in Šiaurės miestelis during the beginning of the 21st century were named for prominent figures in Lithuanian military history: Povilas Lukšys, Lithuanian army volunteer, the first to perish in the Independence Wars in 1919 with the Bolshevik forces, as well as Kazys Ladyga, Silvestras Žukauskas, Jonas Galvydis-Bikauskas, Vladas Nagevičius, and Jurgis Kubilius, prominent officers of the inter-war Lithuanian Army, whose histories are not directly related to the area. On the contrary, these personalities distinguished themselves by opposing the Bolshevik and Polish armies that were historically garrisoned in Šiaurės miestelis. The naming was suggested by the Ministry of Defence.[44] There are more streets not far from Šiaurės miestelis that bear military-themed names: Raitininkų (""Cavalrymen""), Žvalgų (""Scouts"") and Rinktinės (""Platoon"").[citation needed]

An international dispute arose in the 2000s over construction near the Jewish cemetery, with organizations expressing concerns that gravesites could be disturbed.[45][46]

The educational institutions in Žirmūnai include three secondary schools, all Lithuanian-language. Tuskulėnai Secondary School (Lithuanian: Tuskulėnų vidurinė mokykla, formerly Vilnius' Secondary School No. 31) had 1,463 students in 2006, which made it the fifth largest school in Vilnius. The school features advanced classes in the visual arts. St. Christopher's Gymnasium (Lithuanian: Šv. Kristoforo gimnazija, formerly Vilnius' Secondary School No. 9) was the eighth largest in Vilnius with 1,391 students in 2006. Žirmūnai Gymnasium (Lithuanian: Žirmūnų gimnazija, formerly Vilnius Secondary School No. 7) had 800 students in 2006.[47] The school was granted the title Gymnasium in 2000; it is home to the acclaimed brass band Septima, established in 1966.[48]

There are three elementary schools located in Žirmūnai: Antoni Wiwulski, Emilia Plater, and St. Christopher. Šarūnas Marčiulionis Basketball School and Vilnius Sports School offer physical education. The Vilnius School of Radioelectronics and Precision Mechanics (Lithuanian: Vilniaus radioelektronikos ir tiksliosios mechanikos mokykla)[49] was established in 1965 to prepare workers for Vilma, a manufacturer of electrical products still operating in Žirmūnai. The Vilnius School of Tourism and Commerce (Lithuanian: Vilniaus turizmo ir prekybos verslo mokykla) offers certificates in retailing, basic bookkeeping, hotel and restaurant services, and other business areas. Vilnius Gija Youth School serves those students who have special needs and do not succeed in traditional classroom settings. Žirmūnai also has one of the three Children's Foster Homes in Vilnius.[citation needed]

As of the census taken in April 2001, 26.2% of Žirmūnai's residents aged 10 or older possessed a bachelor's or higher degree.[citation needed]

Tuskulėnai Manor is Žirmūnai's oldest extant architectural structure. The manor was built in 1825, following a design by Karol Podczaszyński in the neoclassical style. It consists of the principal building (the palace), an officina (storage house), and several adjacent buildings, including a small eclectic chapel of St. Theresa located about 100 metres south of the principal building.[50] The ""Little White Manor"", also known as the villa of Franciszek Walicki, was built in 1866 further south from the manor, acquired by Walicki in 1928, and reconstructed to serve as a summer residence.[20] All of these structures have been restored by 2009, and are a part of the 7.5-hectare Peace Park (Rimties parkas) that includes the Tuskulėnai Manor, hosting a museum of martyrology in Lithuania in the second half of the 20th century (a branch of the Lithuanian Museum of Genocide Victims), restored landscaping, as well as the columbarium.[citation needed]

A Museum of Computing was opened in 2001 in Žirmūnai by the Lithuanian software company Sintagma, showcasing the history of Lithuanian computing science and hardware production. It was based on a museum opened in 1985 by Sigma, one of the leading computer manufacturers in the former Soviet Union. The museum's exhibits include EV-80, the first Soviet vacuum tube computing machine manufactured by Sigma, and a copy of the IBM 604.[51]

Three of the 19 brick chapels of the Vilnius Stations of the Cross (Vilniaus Kalvarijos), part of Verkiai Regional Park, are located at the extreme northwestern corner of Žirmūnai, just within the elderate's border. Once destroyed in 1963 and completely rebuilt, the three chapels, symbolizing the Mount of Olives and the Gardens of Gethsemane, are found only 20 meters away from the relatively busy Verkių Street, and about a hundred meters downhill from a group of Soviet multi-storey apartment buildings.[citation needed]

The forested area along the banks of the River Neris in Žirmūnai and its walkways are a popular recreational destination for many Vilnians.[citation needed]

As a primarily residential area, Žirmūnai hosted only 7.4% of Vilnius' public offices in 2003.[52] Žirmūnai is the location of the Personal Identity Documents Centre of Lithuania's Ministry of the Interior which produces all of Lithuania's identity cards, passports, and driver's licenses, as well as residency permits. Issuance of residence permits is controlled by Vilnius City Migration Service, which is housed in Žirmūnai too. The State Tax Inspectorate has an office in Šiaurės Miestelis, providing services to private as well as legal persons. There are also several medicine-related institutions, such as the Ministry of Health's State Public Health Service, the Vilnius city morgue. The Institute of Forensic Medicine of the Mykolas Romeris University was headquartered in Šiaurės Miestelis as well. The Lithuanian National Olympic Committee, the Vilnius Department of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange at the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Honorary Vice-Consulate of the Kingdom of Spain, and the National Examination Center, established by the Ministry of Education to organize centralized nationwide examinations of high school graduates, all have headquarters in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

Several notable sports facilities are located in Žirmūnai, including Žalgiris Stadium, Lithuania's largest stadium,[5] and Impuls Plus fitness club. Rowing practices take place on the River Neris; there is a base of operation, as well as several piers, on the Žirmūnai bank of the river. One of Lithuania's largest indoor public swimming pools was situated in Žirmūnai until the 1990s. Part of the annual international Vilnius Marathon course runs along the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris.[53]

The Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports (Koncertų ir sporto rūmai), built in 1971 in the southernmost part of Žirmūnai in the middle of the former cemetery, is an example of Soviet Constructivism[54] and Brutalist architecture[citation needed], remarkable for its vessel-like exterior. The Palace, once one of the architectonic icons of Soviet Vilnius, was, until the 1990s, a major venue for sporting events, especially local and international basketball matches, as well as concerts and shows. Its seating capacity is about 4,400. On 22–23 October 1988 the building hosted the statutory meeting of Sąjūdis, the Lithuanian political organization that led the struggle for Lithuanian independence; on 14–15 January 1991, a public funeral for the victims of the January Events took place at the Palace. Later in the 1990s, the building was used as a temporary shopping mall where space was leased to small entrepreneurs for business exhibitions and fairs. In the 2000s developers announced plans to build multifunctional complexes, incorporating sports, business and residential structures, that would replace Žalgiris Stadium and the Palace of Concerts and Sports; the projects have been stalled due to the inclusion of the Palace into the list ""Registry of Cultural Values"" in July 2006,[55] and related litigation.[56]

The Vilnius Palace of Culture, Entertainment and Sports (an example of Soviet functionalism[57] built in 1980 as the Palace of Culture and Sports of the Ministry of Interior), hosts several amateur art clubs (choirs in particular), and is also used for indoor sports (wrestling, martial arts, artistic gymnastics, volleyball, basketball), as well as lawn tennis, including two clay courts.[citation needed]

Oskaras Koršunovas Theatre has occupied the former Lietuvos Rytas Arena which was the home of Lithuania's starring basketball team Lietuvos Rytas until the 2004 season, and was also used by the former women's basketball team BC Teo. Along with the Vilnius Palace of Culture, Entertainment and Sports, it was used in 2006 as part of the set for 9/11: The Twin Towers,[58] a docudrama about the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City, a Dangerous Films production for BBC and Discovery Channel.[59] Ūkio banko teatro arena (""Ūkio Bankas Theater Arena"") is now the venue of performances of Eimuntas Nekrošius of Meno Fortas and Anželika Cholina Dance Theatre.[citation needed]

Southern Žirmūnai's sporting connections are reflected in the names of the streets along the Žirmūnai side of the River Neris: Sporto (""Sports"") and Olimpiečių (""Olympians""). The Palace of Students' Technical Creative Work of the Republic is Lithuania's largest facility for high school students' after-school activities of a technical nature, such as model building and go-kart racing. The Grand Theater of Vilnius (Didysis Vilniaus teatras) is a small theater (its misnomer is intentional) that is formally based in Šiaurės miestelis; it has no venue of its own and holds performances in other theaters.[60]

A building close to the western border of the Žirmūnai elderate, an example of Socialist historicism[61] built soon after the end of World War II, was the home of the Tėvynė (""Motherland"") Cinema until the early 1990s; it has been hosting the New York musical theatre and club since 2004.[62] It is unclear whether this building will be demolished to make way for underground parking lots or saved by virtue of its inclusion into the Registry of Cultural Values.[63]

1,414 businesses, comprising 8.7% of all Vilnius' businesses, were headquartered in the Žirmūnai elderate in 2003.[52] Lithuania's largest electricity distribution network operator, Rytų skirstomieji tinklai, operates from Žirmūnai, as well as  TELE2, one of Lithuania's three mobile communications operators; Ogmios, one of Lithuania's largest retailers and wholesalers of home appliances; and Vilpra, Lithuania's largest dealer of heating equipment.[citation needed]

In 1992, the former prominent Lithuanian basketball player Šarūnas Marčiulionis and his business partners opened the Šarūnas Hotel in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

The Banginis and Rimi Hypermarket, located in Šiaurės miestelis, are among Lithuania's largest shopping centers. Vilniaus duona (""The Bread of Vilnius""), Lithuania's largest baking company, operates one of its bakeries in Žirmūnai.[citation needed]

An abundance of automotive service facilities and car dealerships are located in the elderate.

The northern part of Žirmūnai was an important part of the Lithuanian SSR's industrial sector during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The Kuro aparatūros gamykla (Fuel Equipment Factory) is now bankrupt; Sigma, formerly one of the leading manufacturers of electronics and computer components in the Soviet Union, which contributed to the description of the Lithuanian SSR as ""The Soviet Silicon Valley"",[64] continues to operate at a minimum level; and Vilma remains Lithuania's largest manufacturer of electrical products.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai is well-served by Vilnius' bus and trolleybus transportation network. One of Vilnius' trolleybus hubs is located in the northernmost part of Žirmūnai elderate, and Vilniaus Autobusai, Vilnius' main bus operator, is headquartered and has its main depot in Žirmūnai. Žirmūnai suffers from rush hour traffic jams. The street network in the district was primarily designed in the Soviet era for a much lower vehicle traffic.[citation needed]

Žirmūnai is linked to the elderate of Antakalnis by three bridges over the River Neris:  Valakampiai Bridge, the longest bridge in Vilnius, built in 1972; the Šilas Bridge, built in 1999, and Žirmūnai Bridge, built in 1965. The Mindaugas Bridge was built in 2003 to link Žirmūnai with Vilnius' Old Town. Passenger ferry transport on the Neris was active until the 1990s, but is now limited to occasional chartered sightseeing tours from the Mindaugas Bridge to Valakampiai in summer.[citation needed]

For some time in the first half of the 20th century, a narrow-gauge railway traversed Žirmūnai following the approximate course of the modern Minties Street; it crossed over the River Neris on a bridge located near the modern Šilas Bridge, as can be seen in the 1942 map of Vilnius.[26]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Žirmūnai
Edmundas Antanas Rimša,"Edmundas Antanas Rimša  (December 15, 1948 in Skirai, Rokiškis district) is a Lithuanian historian, specialist of heraldics, sfragistics and genealogy.

In 1977, Rimša graduated from Vilnius University and began working at the Ministry of Culture of the Lithuanian SSR. In 1981, he began working at the Lithuanian History Institute. In 1993 he received Ph.D. for his doctoral thesis Coat of Arms in the History of Lithuanian Cities. He has been teaching at Vilnius University (from 1991) and Vytautas Magnus University (in 1995–98). Rimša works as a consultant at Vilnius Academy of Fine Arts and as an expert of coins design at the Bank of Lithuania.[1]

Rimša is a member of the editorial board of academic journals Lietuvos istorijos metraštis (Lithuanian History Annals) and Numizmatika, published by the Lithuanian National Museum. He is a member of the Poland Heraldry Association[2] and the chairman of the Lithuanian Heraldry Commission.

For his book Lietuvos Didžiosios Kunigaikštystės miestų antspaudai, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas.

History of eugenics,"The history of eugenics is the study of development and advocacy of ideas related to eugenics around the world. Early eugenic ideas were discussed in Ancient Greece and Rome. The height of the modern eugenics movement came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

According to Plutarch, in Sparta every proper citizen's child was inspected by the council of elders, the Gerousia, which determined whether or not the child was fit to live.[1] If the child was deemed unfit, the child was thrown into a chasm.[2][3] Plutarch is the sole historical source for the Spartan practice of systemic infanticide motivated by eugenics.[4] While infanticide was practiced by Greeks, no contemporary sources support Plutarch's claims of mass infanticide motivated by eugenics.[5] In 2007 the suggestion that infants were dumped near Mount Taygete was called into question due to a lack of physical evidence. Anthropologist Theodoros Pitsios' research found only bodies from adolescence up to the age of approximately 35.[6][7]

Plato's political philosophy included the belief that human reproduction should be cautiously monitored and controlled by the state through selective breeding.[8][9]

According to Tacitus (c. 56 – c. 120), a Roman of the Imperial Period, the Germanic tribes of his day killed any member of their community they deemed cowardly, unwarlike or ""stained with abominable vices"", usually by drowning them in swamps.[10][11] Modern historians see Tacitus' ethnographic writing as unreliable in such details.[12][13]

Another question entirely is why eugenics rose, and did so in ways whose complexity still grounds a highly active field of study in intellectual history today.

In 1798, Thomas Malthus proposed his hypothesis in An Essay on the Principle of Population.

He argued that although human populations tend to increase, the happiness of a nation requires a like increase in food production. ""The happiness of a country does not depend, absolutely, upon its poverty, or its riches, upon its youth, or its age, upon its being thinly, or fully inhabited, but upon the rapidity with which it is increasing, upon the degree in which the yearly increase of food approaches to the yearly increase of an unrestricted population.""[14]

However, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:

We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.

Famine seems to be the last, the most dreadful resource of nature. The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction, and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and tens of thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.

The idea of progress was at once a social, political and scientific theory. The theory of evolution, as described in Darwin's The Origin of Species, provided for many social theorists the necessary scientific foundation for the idea of social and political progress. The terms evolution and progress were often used interchangeably in the 19th century.[19]

Dysgenics  refers to any decrease in the prevalence of traits deemed to be either socially desirable or generally adaptive to their environment due to selective pressure disfavouring their reproduction.[20]

In 1915 the term was used by David Starr Jordan to describe the supposed deleterious effects of modern warfare on group-level genetic fitness because of its tendency to kill physically healthy men while preserving the disabled at home.[21][22] Similar concerns had been raised by early eugenicists and social Darwinists during the 19th century, and continued to play a role in scientific and public policy debates throughout the 20th century.[23]

More recent concerns about supposed dysgenic effects in human populations were advanced by the controversial psychologist and self-described ""scientific racist""[24] Richard Lynn, notably in his 1996 book Dysgenics: Genetic Deterioration in Modern Populations, which argued that changes in selection pressures and decreased infant mortality since the Industrial Revolution have resulted in an increased propagation of deleterious traits and genetic disorders.[25][26]

Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911) systematized these ideas and practices according to new knowledge about the evolution of man and animals provided by the theory of his half-cousin Charles Darwin during the 1860s and 1870s. After reading Darwin's Origin of Species, Galton built upon Darwin's ideas whereby the mechanisms of natural selection were potentially thwarted by human civilization. He reasoned that, since many human societies sought to protect the underprivileged and weak, those societies were at odds with the natural selection responsible for extinction of the weakest, and only by changing these social policies could society be saved from a ""reversion towards mediocrity"", a phrase he first coined in statistics and which later changed to the now-common ""regression towards the mean"".[31] (Incidentally, Galton also coined the phrase ""nature versus nurture"".)

Galton first sketched out his theory in the 1865 article ""Hereditary Talent and Character"", then elaborated further in his 1869 book Hereditary Genius.[32] He began by studying the way in which human intellectual, moral, and personality traits tended to run in families. Galton's basic argument was that ""genius"" and ""talent"" were hereditary traits in humans, although neither he nor Darwin yet had a working model of this type of heredity. He concluded that, since one could use artificial selection to exaggerate traits in other animals, one could expect similar results when applying such models to humans. As he wrote in the introduction to Hereditary Genius:

I propose to show in this book that a man's natural abilities are derived by inheritance, under exactly the same limitations as are the form and physical features of the whole organic world. Consequently, as it is easy, notwithstanding those limitations, to obtain by careful selection a permanent breed of dogs or horses gifted with peculiar powers of running, or of doing anything else, so it would be quite practicable to produce a highly gifted race of men by judicious marriages during several consecutive generations.[33]

Galton claimed that the less intelligent were more fertile than the more intelligent of his time. Galton did not propose any selection methods; rather, he hoped a solution would be found if social mores changed in a way that encouraged people to see the importance of breeding. He first used the word eugenic in his 1883 Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development,[34] a book in which he meant ""to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with 'eugenic' questions"". He included a footnote to the word ""eugenic"" which read:

That is, with questions bearing on what is termed in Greek, eugenes namely, good in stock, hereditary endowed with noble qualities. This, and the allied words, eugeneia, etc., are equally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a brief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no means confined to questions of judicious mating, but which, especially in the case of man, takes cognizance of all influences that tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word eugenics would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a neater word and a more generalized one than viriculture which I once ventured to use.[35]

In 1908, in Memories of my Life, Galton defined eugenics as ""the study of agencies under social control that may improve or impair the racial qualities of future generations, either physically or mentally"",[36] a definition agreed in consultation with a committee that included the biometrician Karl Pearson. It was slightly at odds with Galton's preferred definition, given in a lecture to the newly formed Sociological Society at the London School of Economics in 1904: ""the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage"".[37] The latter definition, which encompassed nurture and environment as well as heredity, was favoured by broadly left-wing, liberal elements of the ensuing ideological divide.[38]

Galton's formulation of eugenics was based on a strong statistical approach, influenced heavily by Adolphe Quetelet's ""social physics"". Unlike Quetelet,  Galton did not exalt the ""average man"" but decried him as mediocre. Galton and his statistical heir Karl Pearson developed what was called the biometrical approach to eugenics, which developed new and complex statistical models (later exported to wholly different fields) to describe the heredity of traits. However, with the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's laws of heredity, two separate camps of eugenics advocates emerged, one of statisticians, the other of biologists. Statisticians thought the biologists had exceptionally crude mathematical models, while biologists thought the statisticians knew little about biology.[39]

Eugenics eventually referred to human selective reproduction with an intent to create children with desirable traits, generally through the approach of influencing differential birth rates. These policies were mostly divided into two categories: positive eugenics, the increased reproduction of those seen to have advantageous hereditary traits; and negative eugenics, the discouragement of reproduction by those with hereditary traits perceived as poor. Negative eugenic policies in the past have ranged from paying those deemed to have bad genes to voluntarily undergo sterilization, attempts at segregation, compulsory sterilization, and even genocide. Positive eugenic policies have typically taken the form of awards or bonuses for ""fit"" parents who have another child. Relatively innocuous practices such as marriage counseling had early links with eugenic ideology. Eugenics is superficially related to what later became known as Social Darwinism. While both claimed intelligence was hereditary, eugenics asserted new policies were needed to actively change the status quo towards a more ""eugenic"" state, while the Social Darwinists argued that society itself would naturally ""check"" the problem of ""dysgenics"" if no welfare policies were in place—for example, the poor might reproduce more but would have higher mortality rates.[40]

Charles Davenport (1866-1944), a scientist from the United States, stands out as one of history's leading eugenicists. He took eugenics from a scientific idea to a worldwide movement implemented in many countries.[41] Davenport obtained funding from the Carnegie Institution, to establish the Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor in 1904[42] and the Eugenics Records Office in 1910, which provided the scientific basis for later Eugenic policies such as enforced sterilization.[43] He was instrumental in building  the International Federation of Eugenics Organizations (IFEO) in 1925, and became its first president.[44] While Davenport was located at Cold Spring Harbor and received money from the Carnegie Institute of Washington, the organization known as the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) started to become an embarrassment after the well-known debates between Davenport and Franz Boas. Davenport continued to occupy the same office and the same address at Cold Spring Harbor, but his organization now became known as the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, which currently retains the archives of the Eugenics Record Office.[45] However, Davenport's racist[clarification needed] views were not supported by all geneticists at Cold Spring Harbor, including H. J. Muller, Bentley Glass, and Esther Lederberg.[46]

In 1932, Davenport welcomed Ernst Rüdin, a prominent Swiss eugenicist and race scientist, as his successor in the position of President of the IFEO.[47]  Rüdin, director of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Institute for Psychiatry), a Kaiser Wilhelm Institute located in Munich,[48] was a co-founder (with his brother-in-law Alfred Ploetz) of the German Society for Racial Hygiene.[49] Ploetz recommended a ""racial hygiene"" system in which panels of physicians decided whether to grant individuals citizenship or euthanasia.[50] Other prominent figures in eugenics who were associated with Davenport included Harry Laughlin (United States), Havelock Ellis (United Kingdom), Irving Fischer (United States), Eugen Fischer (Germany), Madison Grant (United States), Lucien Howe (United States), and Margaret Sanger (United States, founder of a New York health clinic that later became Planned Parenthood).  Later Sanger commissioned the first birth control pill.[51]

In September 1903, an ""Inter-departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration"" chaired by Almeric W. FitzRoy was appointed by the government ""to make a preliminary enquiry into the allegations concerning the deterioration of certain classes of the population as shown by the large percentage of rejections for physical causes of recruits for the Army"", and gave its Report to both houses of parliament in the following year.[52] Among its recommendations, originating from professor Daniel John Cunningham, were an anthropometric survey of the British population. The Catholic church was opposed to eugenics, as illustrated in the writings of Father Thomas John Gerrard.[53]

Eugenics was supported by many prominent figures of different political persuasions before World War I (and as positive eugenics after the War), including: Liberal economists William Beveridge and John Maynard Keynes; Fabian socialists such as the Irish author George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Havelock Ellis, Beatrice Webb and Sidney Webb and other literary figures such as D. H. Lawrence; and Conservatives such as the future Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Arthur Balfour.[54] The influential economist John Maynard Keynes was a prominent supporter of eugenics, serving as Director of the British Eugenics Society, and  writing that eugenics is ""the most important, significant and, I would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists"".[55]

Francis Galton explained during a lecture in 1901 the groupings which are shown in the opening figure and indicated the proportion of society falling into each group, along with their perceived genetic worth. Galton suggested that negative eugenics (i.e. an attempt to prevent them from bearing offspring) should be applied only to those in the lowest social group (the ""Undesirables""), while positive eugenics applied to the higher classes. However, he appreciated the worth of the higher working classes to society and industry.[citation needed]

The 1913 Mental Deficiency Act proposed the mass segregation of the ""feeble minded"" from the rest of society.[56] Sterilisation programmes were never legalised, although some were carried out in private upon the mentally ill by clinicians who were in favour of a more widespread eugenics plan.[57] The Act, however, enabled the formation of residential schools for the ""feeble minded"" by social workers such as Mary Dendy.[58]

Those in support of eugenics shifted their lobbying of Parliament from enforced to voluntary sterilization, in the hope of achieving more legal recognition.[57] In 1931, Labour Party Member of Parliament Major A. G. Church, proposed a Private Member's Bill to legalise the operation for voluntary sterilization. This was rejected by 167 votes to 89.[59] In 1934, the Brock Report of the Departmental Committee on Sterilisation recommended sterilisation of disabled people but the Report's recommendations were not followed by changes to the law.[60]

Two universities (University College London and Liverpool University) established courses on eugenics. The Galton Institute, affiliated to UCL, was headed by Galton's protégé, Karl Pearson.[61]

In 2008, the British Parliament passed a law prohibiting couples from choosing deaf and disabled embryos for implantation.[62]

In 2012, the British Parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act 2012. The law created various caps on welfare payments, most prominently the two-child benefits cap, with the government's stated aims being to push non-working parents into employment, reduce the number of children born to parents in receipt of state benefits and minimise the cost of welfare to taxpayers. The policy has been critiqued by researchers as an attempt to restrict the reproductive rights of poorer citizens, as well as being a major source of child and family poverty since 2017.[63][64][65]

One of the earliest modern advocates of eugenics (before it was labeled as such) was Alexander Graham Bell. In 1881 Bell investigated the rate of deafness on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. From this he concluded that deafness was hereditary in nature and, through noting that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children, tentatively suggested that couples where both were deaf should not marry, in his lecture Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race presented to the National Academy of Sciences on 13 November 1883.[66][67] However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders' Association (ABA). The committee unequivocally extended the principle to humans.[68]

Another scientist considered the ""father of the American eugenics movement"" was Charles Benedict Davenport.[69]  In 1904 he secured funding for the Station for Experimental Evolution, later renamed the Carnegie Department of Genetics.  It was also around that time that Davenport became actively involved with the ABA. This led to Davenport's first eugenics text, ""The science of human improvement by better breeding"", one of the first papers to connect agriculture and human heredity.[69] Davenport later went on to set up a Eugenics Record Office (ERO), collecting hundreds of thousands of medical histories from Americans, which many considered to have a racist and anti-immigration agenda.[69] Davenport and his views were supported at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as late as 1963, when his views began to be de-emphasized.

As the science continued in the 20th century, researchers interested in familial mental disorders conducted a number of studies to document the heritability of such illnesses as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Their findings were used by the eugenics movement as proof for its cause. State laws were written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to prohibit marriage and force sterilization of the mentally ill in order to prevent the ""passing on"" of mental illness to the next generation. These laws were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1927 and were not abolished until the mid-20th century.  All in all, 60,000 Americans were sterilized.[70]

Michigan became the first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill on May 16, 1897. However, the law did not pass. The proposed law, which called for the mandatory castration of defined types of criminals and ""degenerates,"" fails to pass in the legislature but sets a precedent for similar laws.[71] In 1907 Indiana became the first of more than thirty states to adopt legislation aimed at compulsory sterilization of certain individuals.[72] Although the law was overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court in 1921,[73] the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a Virginia law allowing for the compulsory sterilization of patients of state mental institutions in 1927.[74]

Beginning with Connecticut in 1896, many states enacted marriage laws with eugenic criteria, prohibiting anyone who was ""epileptic, imbecile or feeble-minded"" from marrying. In 1898 Charles B. Davenport, a prominent American biologist, began as director of a biological research station based in Cold Spring Harbor where he experimented with evolution in plants and animals. In 1904 Davenport received funds from the Carnegie Institution to found the Station for Experimental Evolution. The Eugenics Record Office (ERO) opened in 1910 while Davenport and Harry H. Laughlin began to promote eugenics.[75]

W. E. B. Du Bois maintained the basic principle of eugenics: that different persons have different inborn characteristics that make them more or less suited for specific kinds of employment, and that by encouraging the most talented members of all races to procreate would better the ""stocks"" of humanity.[76][77]

The Immigration Restriction League (founded in 1894) was the first American entity associated officially with eugenics. The League sought to bar what it considered dysgenic members of certain races from entering America and diluting what it saw as the superior American racial stock through procreation. They lobbied for a literacy test for immigrants, based on the belief that literacy rates were low among ""inferior races"". Literacy test bills were vetoed by President William McKinley in 1897 and by President Woodrow Wilson in 1913 and 1915; eventually, President Wilson's second veto was overruled by Congress in 1917. Membership in the League included: A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard University, William DeWitt Hyde, president of Bowdoin College, James T. Young, director of Wharton School, and David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University. The League allied themselves with the American Breeder's Association to gain influence and further its goals and in 1909 established a eugenics committee chaired by David Starr Jordan with members Charles Davenport, Alexander Graham Bell, Vernon Kellogg, Luther Burbank, William Earnest Castle, Adolf Meyer, H. J. Webber and Friedrich Woods.[78] The ABA's immigration legislation committee, formed in 1911 and headed by League's founder Prescott F. Hall, formalized the committee's already strong relationship with the Immigration Restriction League.[78]

In years to come, the ERO collected a mass of family pedigrees and concluded that those who were unfit came from economically and socially poor backgrounds. Eugenicists such as Davenport, the psychologist Henry H. Goddard and the conservationist Madison Grant (all well respected in their time) began to lobby for various solutions to the problem of the ""unfit"". (Davenport favored immigration restriction and sterilization as primary methods; Goddard favored segregation in his The Kallikak Family; Grant favored all of the above and more, even entertaining the idea of extermination.)[79] Though their methodology and research methods are now understood as highly flawed, at the time this was seen as legitimate scientific research.[80] It did, however, have scientific detractors (notably, Thomas Hunt Morgan, one of the few Mendelians to explicitly criticize eugenics), though most of these focused more on what they considered the crude methodology of eugenicists, and the characterization of almost every human characteristic as being hereditary, rather than the idea of eugenics itself.[81]

Some states sterilized ""imbeciles"" for much of the 20th century. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1927 Buck v. Bell case that the state of Virginia could sterilize individuals under the Virginia Sterilization Act of 1924. The most significant era of eugenic sterilization was between 1907 and 1963, when over 64,000 individuals were forcibly sterilized under eugenics legislation in the United States.[82] A favorable report on the results of sterilization in California, the state with the most sterilizations by far, was published in book form by the biologist Paul Popenoe and was widely cited by the Nazi government as evidence that wide-reaching sterilization programs were feasible and humane.

Such legislation was passed in the U.S. because of widespread public acceptance of the eugenics movement, spearheaded by efforts of progressive reformers.[83] Over 19 million people attended the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, open for 10 months from February 20 to December 4, 1915.[84] The PPIE was a fair devoted to extolling the virtues of a rapidly progressing nation, featuring new developments in science, agriculture, manufacturing and technology. A subject that received a large amount of time and space was that of the developments concerning health and disease, particularly the areas of tropical medicine and race betterment (tropical medicine being the combined study of bacteriology, parasitology and entomology while racial betterment being the promotion of eugenic studies). Having these areas so closely intertwined, it seemed that they were both categorized in the main theme of the fair, the advancement of civilization. Thus in the public eye, the seemingly contradictory areas of study were both represented under progressive banners of improvement and were made to seem like plausible courses of action to better American society.[85]

The state of California was at the vanguard of the American eugenics movement, performing about 20,000 sterilizations or one-third of the 60,000 nationwide from 1909 up until the 1960s.[84] By 1910, there was a large and dynamic network of scientists, reformers and professionals engaged in national eugenics projects and actively promoting eugenic legislation. The American Breeder's Association was the first eugenic body in the U.S., established in 1906 under the direction of biologist Charles B. Davenport. The ABA was formed specifically to ""investigate and report on heredity in the human race, and emphasize the value of superior blood and the menace to society of inferior blood"". Membership included Alexander Graham Bell, Stanford president David Starr Jordan and Luther Burbank.[86]

When Nazi administrators went on trial for war crimes in Nuremberg after World War II, they attempted to justify the mass sterilizations (over 450,000 in less than a decade) by citing the United States as their inspiration.[70] The Nazis had claimed American eugenicists inspired and supported Hitler's racial purification laws, and failed to understand the connection between those policies and the eventual genocide of the Holocaust.[87]

The idea of ""genius"" and ""talent"" is also considered by William Graham Sumner, a founder of the American Sociological Society (now called the American Sociological Association). He maintained that if the government did not meddle with the social policy of laissez-faire, a class of genius would rise to the top of the system of social stratification, followed by a class of talent. Most of the rest of society would fit into the class of mediocrity. Those who were considered to be defective (mentally delayed, handicapped, etc.) had a negative effect on social progress by draining off necessary resources. They should be left on their own to sink or swim. But those in the class of delinquent (criminals, deviants, etc.) should be eliminated from society (""Folkways"", 1907).

However, methods of eugenics were applied to reformulate more restrictive definitions of white racial purity in existing state laws banning interracial marriage: the so-called anti-miscegenation laws. The most famous example of the influence of eugenics and its emphasis on strict racial segregation on such ""anti-miscegenation"" legislation was Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924.[citation needed] The U.S. Supreme Court overturned this law in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia, and declared anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional.

With the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, eugenicists for the first time played an important role in the Congressional debate as expert advisers on the threat of ""inferior stock"" from eastern and southern Europe.[88]  While eugenicists did support the act, they were also backed by many labor unions.[89] The new act, inspired by the eugenic belief in the racial superiority of ""old stock"" white Americans as members of the ""Nordic race"" (a form of white supremacy), strengthened the position of existing laws prohibiting race-mixing.[90] Eugenic considerations also lay behind the adoption of incest laws in much of the U.S. and were used to justify many anti-miscegenation laws.[91]

Stephen Jay Gould asserted that restrictions on immigration passed in the United States during the 1920s (and overhauled in 1965 with the Immigration and Nationality Act) were motivated by the goals of eugenics. During the early 20th century, the United States and Canada began to receive far higher numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. It has been argued that this stirred both Canada and the United States into passing laws creating a hierarchy of nationalities, rating them from the most desirable Anglo-Saxon and Nordic peoples to the Chinese and Japanese immigrants, who were almost completely banned from entering the country.[92] Others, however, argued that Congress gave virtually no consideration to these factors, and claim the restrictions were motivated primarily by a desire to maintain the country's cultural integrity against the heavy influx of foreigners.[93]

In the US, eugenics supporters included Theodore Roosevelt.[94] Research was funded by distinguished philanthropies and carried out at prestigious universities.[95] It was taught in college and high school classrooms.[96]  In its time eugenics was touted by some as scientific and progressive;[83] the natural application of knowledge about breeding to the arena of human life. Before the realization of death camps in World War II, the idea that eugenics would lead to genocide was not taken seriously by the average American.

The policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their parents emerged from an opinion based on Eugenics theory in late 19th and early 20th century Australia that the 'full-blood' tribal Aborigine would be unable to sustain itself, and was doomed to inevitable extinction, as at the time huge numbers of aborigines were in fact dying out, from diseases caught from European settlers.[97] An ideology at the time held that mankind could be divided into a civilizational hierarchy. This notion supposed that Northern Europeans were superior in civilization and that Aborigines were inferior. According to this view, the increasing numbers of mixed-descent children in Australia, labeled as ""half-castes"" (or alternatively ""crossbreeds"", ""quadroons"", and ""octoroons"") should develop within their respective communities, white or aboriginal, according to their dominant parentage.[98]

In the first half of the 20th century, this led to policies and legislation that resulted in the removal of children from their tribe.[99]
The stated aim was to culturally assimilate mixed-descent people into contemporary Australian society. In all states and territories legislation was passed in the early years of the 20th century which gave Aboriginal protectors guardianship rights over Aborigines up to the age of sixteen or twenty-one. Policemen or other agents of the state (such as Aboriginal Protection Officers), were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their communities into institutions. In these Australian states and territories, half-caste institutions (both government or missionary) were established in the early decades of the 20th century for the reception of these separated children.[100][101] The 2002 movie Rabbit-Proof Fence portrays a true story about this system and the harrowing consequences of attempting to overcome it.

In 1922, A.O. Neville was appointed the second Western Australia State Chief Protector of Aborigines. During the next quarter-century, he presided over the now notorious 'Assimilation' policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their parents.

Neville believed that biological absorption was the key to 'uplifting the Native race'. Speaking before the Moseley Royal Commission, which investigated the administration of Aboriginals in 1934, he defended the policies of forced settlement, removing children from parents, surveillance, discipline and punishment, arguing that ""they have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of the surgeon's knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the patient's will"". In his twilight years, Neville continued to actively promote his policy. Towards the end of his career, Neville published Australia's Coloured Minority, a text outlining his plan for the biological absorption of aboriginal people into white Australia.[102][103]

The idea of  Social Darwinism was widespread among Brazil's leading scientists, educators, social thinkers, as well as many elected officials, in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This led to the ""Politica de Branqueamento"" (Whitening Policies) set in practice in Brazil in the early part of the 20th century. This series of laws intended to enlarge the numbers of the white race in Brazil through miscegenation with European immigrants.

The first official organized movement of eugenics in South America was a Eugenics Conference in April 1917, which was followed in January 1918 by the founding of the São Paulo Society of Eugenics. This society worked with health agencies and psychiatric offices to promote their ideas. The year 1931 saw the foundation of the ""Comitê Central de Eugenismo"" (Central Committee on Eugenics) presided by Renato Kehl. Among its suggestions were an end to the immigration of non-whites to Brazil, and the spread of policies against miscegenation.[105]

The ideas of the Central Committee on Eugenics clashed with the Whitening Policies of the beginning of the 20th century. While the Whitening Policies advocated miscegenation in order to reduce the numbers of pure Africans in Brazil in favor of mulattos, who were expected to then produce white off-spring – a policy very similar to the ""uplifting the Native race"" in Australia – the Central Committee on Eugenics advocated no miscegenation at all and separation between the whites and non-whites in Brazil. When it became obvious that the future of Brazil was in industrialization (just as it was for other countries around the world), Brazil had to face whether they had a working force capable of being absorbed by an industrial society. [dubious – discuss][citation needed]

A new ideology was needed to counter such racialist claims. This ideology, known as Lusotropicalism, was associated with Gilberto Freyre, and became popular throughout the Portuguese Empire: specifically, Brazil and Angola. Lusotropicalism claimed that its large population of mixed-race people made Brazil the most capable country in tropical climates to carry out a program of industrialization.[dubious – discuss] Its mixed-race population had the cultural and intellectual capabilities provided by the white race,[citation needed] which could not work in tropical climates, combined with the physical ability to work in tropical climates, provided by the African black race. This excluded the fact that white prisoners, working under penal servitude in Puerto Rico, seemed quite capable of working in a tropical environment. [citation needed]

In the first decades of the twentieth century, the work of the Rockefeller Foundation was decisive for the implementation of public health initiatives in Brazil, especially in the so-called public health movement. At that time, Brazilian eugenics was the same as public health, as expressed in the maxim ""to sanitize is to eugenize"".[106]

In Canada, the eugenics movement gained support early in the 20th century as prominent physicians drew a direct link between heredity and public health.[107] Eugenics was enforced by law in two Canadian provinces. In Alberta, the Sexual Sterilization Act was enacted in 1928, focusing the movement on the sterilization of mentally deficient individuals, as determined by the Alberta Eugenics Board.[108] The campaign to enforce this action was backed by groups such as the United Farm Women's Group, including key member Emily Murphy.[109]

As in many other former British Empire colonies, eugenic policies were linked to racist (and racialist) agendas pursued by various levels of government, such as the forced sterilization of Canada's indigenous peoples and specific provincial government initiatives, such as Alberta's eugenics program. As a brief illustration, in 1928 the province of Alberta started an initiative, ""…allowing any inmate of a native residential school to be sterilized upon the approval of the school Principal. At least 3,500 Indian women are sterilized under this law.""[110] As of 2011, research into extant archival records of sterilization and direct killing of First Nations youth (through intentional transmission of disease and other means) under the residential school program is ongoing.[111]

Individuals were assessed using IQ tests like the Stanford-Binet. This posed a problem to new immigrants arriving in Canada, as many had not mastered the English language, and often their scores denoted them as having impaired intellectual functioning. As a result, many of those sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were immigrants who were unfairly categorized.[112] The province of British Columbia enacted its own Sexual Sterilization Act in 1933. As in Alberta, the British Columbia Eugenics Board could recommend the sterilization of those it considered to be suffering from ""mental disease or mental deficiency"".[113]

Although not enforced by laws as it was in Canada's western provinces, an obscenity trial in Depression-era Ontario, can be seen as an example of the influence of eugenics in Ontario. Dorothea Palmer, a nurse working for the Parents Information Bureau – a privately funded birth control organization based out of Kitchener, Ontario – was arrested in the predominantly Catholic community of Eastview, Ontario in 1936. She was accused of illegally providing birth control materials and knowledge to her clients, primarily poor women. The defense at her trial was mounted by an industrialist and influential eugenicist from Kitchener, A.R. Kaufman. Palmer was acquitted in early 1937. The trial lasted less than a year, and later became known as The Eastview Birth Control Trial, demonstrating the influence of the eugenics lobby in Ontario.

The popularity of the eugenics movement peaked during the Depression when sterilization was widely seen as a way of relieving society of the financial burdens imposed by defective individuals.[114] Although the eugenics excesses of Nazi Germany diminished the popularity of the eugenics movement, the Sexual Sterilization Acts of Alberta and British Columbia were not repealed until 1972.[115]

Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler was well known for eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a ""pure"" Aryan race through a series of programs that ran under the banner of racial hygiene. Among other activities, the Nazis performed extensive experimentation on live human beings to test their genetic theories, ranging from simple measurement of physical characteristics to the research for Otmar von Verschuer carried out by Karin Magnussen using ""human material"" gathered by Josef Mengele on twins and others at Auschwitz death camp.[116] During the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazi regime used forced sterilization on hundreds of thousands of people whom they viewed as mentally ill, an estimated 400,000 between 1934 and 1937. The scale of the Nazi program prompted one American eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of their program, with one complaining that ""the Germans are beating us at our own game.""[117]

The Nazis went further, however, murdering tens of thousands of the institutionalized disabled through compulsory ""euthanasia"" programs such as Aktion T4. They used gas chambers and lethal injections to murder their victims.[118]

They also implemented a number of ""positive"" eugenics policies, giving awards to Aryan women who had large numbers of children and encouraged a service in which ""racially pure"" single women could deliver illegitimate children. Allegations that such women were also impregnated by SS officers in the Lebensborn were not proven at the Nuremberg trials, but new evidence (and the testimony of Lebensborn children) has established more details about Lebensborn practices.[119] Also, ""racially valuable"" children from occupied countries were forcibly removed from their parents and adopted by German people. Many of their concerns for eugenics and racial hygiene were also explicitly present in their systematic murder of millions of ""undesirable"" people, especially Jews who were singled out for the Final Solution, this policy led to the horrors seen in the Holocaust.[120]

The scope and coercion involved in the German eugenics programs along with a strong use of the rhetoric of eugenics and so-called ""racial science"" throughout the regime created an indelible cultural association between eugenics and the Third Reich in the post-war years.[121]

The ideas of eugenics and race were used, in part, as justification for German colonial expansion throughout the world. Germany, as well as Great Britain, sought to seize the colonial territories of other 'dying' empires which could no longer protect their possessions. Examples included China, the Portuguese Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Empire and the Danish Empire.

Thus the colonies Germany required for her bursting population, as markets for her overproductive industries and sources of vital raw materials, and as symbols of her world power would simply have to be taken from weaker nations, so the pan-Germans asserted publicly and the German government believed secretly.[122]

German colonies in Africa from 1885 to 1918 included German South-West Africa (present-day Namibia), Kamerun (present-day Cameroon), Togoland (present-day Togo) and German East Africa (present-day Tanzania. Rwanda and Burundi). Genocide was carried out there, against the Herero people of present-day Namibia and later a programme of research in physical anthropology was conducted using their skulls.

The rulers of German South West Africa carried out a programme of genocide against the aboriginal Herero people. One of the officials enacting this program was General Adrian Dietrich Lothar von Trotha.

The 1918 British ""Bluebook"" documented the genocide that took place at Shark Island and Windhoek Concentration Camps, including photographs.[125] The Bluebook was used as a negotiating tool by the British at the end of World War I to gain control of what had been German Southwest Africa, after Germany was defeated.[126]

Skulls of the Herero were collected from Rehoboth, Namibia in about 1904, for the purpose of demonstrating the supposed physical inferiority of these people. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute used the Herero skulls by 1928.[127]

The physical anthropologists used measurements of skull capacity, etc., in an attempt to prove that Jews, Blacks and Italians were inherently ""inferior"" to Whites. Examples of such activity were found from about 1928 at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics. This contrasted with a lot of 19th-century German anthropology which was generally more cosmopolitan.[128]

Eugen Fischer of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics and his students carried out ""Bastard studies"" anthropological studies of mixed race people throughout the German colonial empire, including the colonies in Africa and the Pacific.[129] Fischer also worked with the United States eugenicist Charles Davenport.

Rita Hauschild, a doctoral student and then staff member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Human Heredity, Anthropology, and Eugenics, carried out ""bastard studies"", anthropometric studies of mixed-heritage populations in Trinidad and Venezuela, in pursuit of the Nazi doctrine of ""racial hygiene"". Her research was at first confined to Tovar, Venezuela, a former German colony, and was extended to Trinidad with support from the UK Foreign Office. The populations studied, in 1935 to 1937, were ""Chinese-Negro hybrids"" in Trinidad, ""Chinese-Indian"" and ""Chinese-Negro"" ""hybrids"" in Venezuela.[130] In addition, Johannes Schaeuble engaged in ""bastard studies"" in Chile.

In the early part of the Shōwa era, Japanese governments executed a eugenics policy to limit the birth of children with ""inferior"" traits, as well as aiming to protect the life and health of mothers.[131] The Race Eugenic Protection Law was submitted from 1934 to 1938 to the Imperial Diet. After four amendments, this draft was promulgated as the National Eugenic Law  in 1940 by the Konoe government.[132] According to the Eugenic Protection Law (1948), sterilization could be enforced on criminals ""with genetic predisposition to commit crime"", patients with genetic diseases such as total color-blindness, hemophilia, albinism and ichthyosis, and mental affections such as schizophrenia, and manic-depressiveness, and those with epilepsy.[133] Mental illnesses were added in 1952.

The Leprosy Prevention laws of 1907, 1931 and 1953, the last one only repealed in 1996, permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums where forced abortions and sterilization were common, even if the laws did not refer to it, and authorized punishment of patients ""disturbing peace"", as most Japanese leprologists believed that vulnerability to the disease was inheritable.[134] There were a few Japanese leprologists such as Noburo Ogasawara who argued against the ""isolation-sterilization policy"" but he was denounced as a traitor to the nation at the 15th conference of the Japanese Association of Leprology in 1941.[135]

One of the last eugenic measures of the Shōwa regime was taken by the Higashikuni government. On 19 August 1945, the Home Ministry ordered local government offices to establish a prostitution service for Allied occupation soldiers to preserve the ""purity"" of the ""Japanese race"". The official declaration stated: ""Through the sacrifice of thousands of ""Okichis"" of the Shōwa era, we shall construct a dike to hold back the mad frenzy of the occupation troops and cultivate and preserve the purity of our race long into the future...""[136]

Early in the Japanese administration of Korea, staff at the Japanese Association of Leprology attempted to discourage marriage between Japanese women and Korean men who had been recruited from the peninsula as laborers following its annexation by Japan in 1910. In 1942, a survey report argued that ""the Korean laborers brought to Japan... are of the lower classes and therefore of inferior constitution...By fathering children with Japanese women, these men could lower the caliber of the Yamato minzoku"".[137] However, eugenics pioneer Unno Kōtoku of Ryukyu University influentially argued based on heterosis in plants that exclusive Japanese endogamy might cause ""degeneration"" of the Japanese race. Since he regarded intermarriage with white or black people as ""disastrous"", he advocated intermarriage with Koreans, whose ""inferior"" physical characteristics would be subsumed by the ""superior"" Japanese, according to his thinking.[138] Japanese-Korean intermarriage was promoted by the government in Korea using serological studies that claimed to prove that Japanese and Koreans had the same pure ancestral origin.[139]

After independence in the late 1940s, both North and South Korea continued to perpetuate the idea of an ethnically homogeneous Korean nation based on a divine single bloodline.[140] This ""pure-blood-ism"" (순혈주의) is a source of pride for many Koreans, and informs Korean nationalism, politics, and foreign relations.[141][142] In South Korea, an ethnic nationalism tinged with pure blood ideology sustained the dictatorships of Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee,[143] and it still serves as a unifying ideology, as Brian Reynolds Myers argues, in North Korea.[140] Deep-seated cultural biases originating in eugenics policies result in discrimination against multiracial people in South Korea, according to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.[144][145]

In the 20th century, the idea of eugenics was imported to South Korea from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.[146][147] During the 1970s and 80s, the military dictatorships of the Fourth and Fifth Republics of South Korea established various internment and concentration camps, most famously the so-called Brothers Home, which forcibly detained people from the lower classes (often falsely accused of being homeless).[148] Additionally, from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s, these dictatorships, as well as the currently ruling Sixth Republic which succeeded them, sterilized mentally ill and intellectually disabled individuals; the exact number of individuals sterilized is not known. A law imposed by Park Chung-Hee permitting the involuntary sterilization of mentally ill or mentally retarded South Koreans was repealed only in 1997.[149]

Eugenics was one of many ideas and programs debated in the 1920s and 1930s in Republican China, as a means of improving society and raising China's stature in the world.  The principal Chinese proponent of eugenics was the prominent sociologist Pan Guangdan, and a significant number of intellectuals entered into the debate, including Gao Xisheng, biologist Zhou Jianren, sociologist Chen Da, and Chen Jianshan, and many others.[150][151] Chen Da is notable for the link he provides to the family planning policy and One Child Policy enacted in China after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.

Other countries that adopted some form of eugenics program at one time include Sweden, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland with programs to sterilize people the government declared to be mentally deficient.[157] In Denmark, the first eugenics law was passed in 1926, under the Social Democrats, with more legislation being passed in 1932. Though the sterilization was initially voluntary (at least theoretically), the law passed in 1932 allowed for involuntary sterilization of some groups.[158]

Beginning in the late 1920s, greater appreciation of the difficulty of predicting characteristics of offspring from their heredity, and scientists' recognition of the inadequacy of simplistic theories of eugenics, undermined whatever scientific basis had been ascribed to the social movement. As the Great Depression took hold, criticism of economic value as a proxy for human worth became increasingly compelling.[159] After the experience of Nazi Germany, many ideas about ""racial hygiene"" and ""unfit"" members of society were discredited.[160] The Nuremberg Trials against former Nazi leaders revealed to the world many of the regime's genocidal practices and resulted in formalized policies of medical ethics and the 1950 UNESCO statement on race. Many scientific societies released their own similar ""race statements"" over the years, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, developed in response to abuses during the Second World War, was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 and affirmed, ""Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.""[161] In continuation, the 1978 UNESCO declaration on race and racial prejudice states that the fundamental equality of all human beings is the ideal toward which ethics and science should converge.[162]

In reaction to Nazi abuses, eugenics became almost universally reviled in many of the nations where it had once been popular (however, some eugenics programs, including sterilization, continued quietly for decades). Many pre-war eugenicists engaged in what they later labeled ""crypto-eugenics"", purposefully taking their eugenic beliefs ""underground"" and becoming respected anthropologists, biologists and geneticists in the postwar world (including Robert Yerkes in the U.S. and Otmar von Verschuer in Germany).[citation needed] Californian eugenicist Paul Popenoe founded marriage counseling during the 1950s, a career change which grew from his eugenic interests in promoting ""healthy marriages"" between ""fit"" couples.[163][better source needed]

In 1957, a special meeting of Britain's Eugenics Society discussed ways to stem losses in membership, including the suggestion ""that the Society should pursue eugenic ends by less obvious means, that is by a policy of crypto-eugenics, which was apparently proving successful with the US Eugenics Society"". In February 1960 the Council resolved to pursue ""activities in crypto-eugenics...vigorously"" and ""specifically"" to increase payments to the Family Planning Association and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The subsequent sale of a birth-control clinic (the bequest of Dr Marie Stopes) to Dr Tim Black and the change of Society's name to Galton Institute (on the grounds that it was ""less evocative"") align with the Society's crypto-eugenic policy.[164]

The American Life League, an opponent of abortion, charges that eugenics was merely ""re-packaged"" after the war, and promoted anew in the guise of the population-control and environmentalism movements. They claim, for example, that Planned Parenthood was funded and cultivated by the Eugenics Society for these reasons. Julian Huxley, the first Director-General of UNESCO and a founder of the World Wildlife Fund, was also a Eugenics Society president and a strong supporter of eugenics.[165]

[E]ven though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable. --Julian Huxley[166]

High school and college textbooks from the 1920s through the 1940s often had chapters touting the scientific progress to be had from applying eugenic principles to the population. Many early scientific journals devoted to heredity in general were run by eugenicists and featured eugenics articles alongside studies of heredity in nonhuman organisms.  Even the names of some journals changed to reflect new attitudes. For example, Eugenics Quarterly became Social Biology in 1969 (the journal still exists today, though it looks little like its predecessor). Notable members of the American Eugenics Society (1922–94) during the second half of the 20th century included Joseph Fletcher, originator of Situational ethics; Clarence Gamble of the Procter & Gamble fortune; and Garrett Hardin, a population control advocate and author of the essay The Tragedy of the Commons.

In the United States, the eugenics movement had largely lost most popular and political support by the end of the 1930s, while forced sterilizations mostly ended in the 1960s with the last performed in 1981.[167] Many US states continued to prohibit biracial marriages with ""anti-miscegenation laws"" such as Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, until they were overruled by the Supreme Court in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia.[168] The Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, which was designed to limit the immigration of ""dysgenic"" Italians, and eastern European Jews, was repealed and replaced by the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965.[169]

However, some prominent academics continued to support eugenics after the war. In 1963 the Ciba Foundation convened a conference in London under the title ""Man and His Future"", at which three distinguished biologists and Nobel laureates (Hermann Muller, Joshua Lederberg, and Francis Crick) all spoke strongly in favor of eugenics.[170][better source needed] A few nations, notably the Canadian province of Alberta, maintained large-scale eugenics programs, including forced sterilization of mentally handicapped individuals, as well as other practices, until the 1970s.[171]

Beginning in the 1980s, the history and concept of eugenics were widely discussed as knowledge about genetics advanced significantly, making practical genetic engineering, which has been widely used to produce genetically modified organisms, with genetically modified foods being most visible to the general public. Endeavors such as the Human Genome Project made the effective modification of the human species seem possible again (as did Darwin's initial theory of evolution in the 1860s, along with the rediscovery of Mendel's laws in the early 20th century).  Article 23 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities prohibits compulsory sterilization of disabled individuals and guarantees their right to adopt children.

A few scientific researchers such as psychologist Richard Lynn, psychologist Raymond Cattell, and scientist Gregory Stock have openly called for eugenic policies using modern technology, but they represent a minority opinion in current scientific and cultural circles.[172] One attempted implementation of a form of eugenics was a ""genius sperm bank"" (1980–99) created by Robert Klark Graham, from which nearly 230 children were conceived (the best-known donors were Nobel Prize winners William Shockley and J. D. Watson). After Graham died in 1997 funding ran out, and within two years his sperm bank had closed.[173]

Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray's book The Bell Curve argued that immigration from countries with low national IQ is undesirable. According to Raymond Cattell, ""when a country is opening its doors to immigration from diverse countries, it is like a farmer who buys his seeds from different sources by the sack, with sacks of different average quality of contents"".[174]

with the People's Republic of China's 1950 Marriage Law stating that ""impotence, venereal disease, mental disorder and leprosy"", as well as any other diseases seen by medical science as making a person unfit to marry, were grounds for prohibition from marriage. The 1980 law dropped all specific conditions bar leprosy, and the 2001 law now specifies no conditions, simply approval by a medical doctor.[175]

Various provinces began to pass laws barring certain classes of people, such as the mentally delayed, from reproducing in the late 1980s.[175] The Chinese Maternal and Infant Health Care Law (1994), which has been referred to as the ""Eugenic Law"" in the West, required a health check prior to marriage. Carriers of certain genetic diseases were allowed to marry only if they are sterilized, or agree to use some other form of long-term contraception.[176] Though the requirement for the health check has been dropped at the national level, it continues to be required by some provinces. Local medical doctors make the decision on who is ""unfit"" to marry.[175] Much Western comment on the law has been critical, but many Chinese geneticists are supportive of the policy.[177]

In the Chinese province of Sichuan in 1999, a sperm bank called Notables' Sperm Bank opened, with professors as the only permitted donors. The semen bank was approved by the authority for family planning in the provincial capital Chengdu.[178]

In postwar Japan, the Eugenic Protection Law (ja:優生保護法, Yusei Hogo Hō) was enacted in 1948 to replace the National Eugenic Law of 1940.[179] The main provisions allowed for the surgical sterilization of women, when the woman, her spouse, or family member within the 4th degree of kinship had a serious genetic disorder, and where pregnancy would endanger the life of the woman. The operation required consent of the woman, her spouse and the approval of the Prefectural Eugenic Protection Council.[180]

The law also allowed for abortion for pregnancies in the cases of rape, leprosy, hereditary-transmitted disease, or if the physician determined that the fetus would not be viable outside of the womb. Again, the consent of the woman and her spouse were necessary. Birth control guidance and implementation was restricted to doctors, nurses and professional midwives accredited by the Prefectural government. The law was also amended in May 1949 to allow abortions for economic reasons at the sole discretion of the doctor, which in effect fully legalized abortion in Japan.[180]

Although the law's wording is unambiguous, it was used by local authorities as justification for measures enforcing forced sterilization and abortions upon people with certain genetic disorders, as well as leprosy, as well as an excuse for legalized discrimination against people with physical and mental handicaps.[181]

In Russia, one supporter of preventive eugenics is the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, who justifies forced sterilization of women, which is practiced in Moscow psychoneurological nursing homes. He states that “one needs a more strictly adjusted and open control for the practice of preventive eugenics, which, in itself, is, in its turn, justifiable.”[182] In 1993, the health minister of the Russian Federation issued the order that determined the procedure of forced abortion and sterilization of disabled women and the need for court decision to perform them.[183] The order was repealed by the head of Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation Tatyana Golikova in 2009.[183] Therefore, now women can be subjected to compulsory sterilization without court decision, according to the Perm Krai ombudswoman Tatyana Margolina.[183] In 2008, Tatyana Margolina reported that 14 women with disabilities were subjected to compulsory medical sterilization in Ozyorskiy psychoneurological nursing home whose director was Grigori Bannikov.[183] The sterilizations were performed not on the basis mandatory court decision appropriate for them, but only on the basis of the application by the guardian Bannikov.[184] On 2 December 2010, the court has not found corpus delicti in the compulsory medical sterilizations performed by his consent.[183]

Dor Yeshorim, a program which seeks to reduce the incidence of Tay–Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Fanconi anemia, familial dysautonomia, glycogen storage disease, Bloom Syndrome, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, and mucolipidosis IV among certain Jewish communities, is another screening program which has drawn comparisons with liberal eugenics.[185] In Israel, at the expense of the state, the general public is advised to carry out genetic tests to diagnose these diseases early in the pregnancy. If a fetus is diagnosed with one of these diseases, among which Tay–Sachs is the most commonly known, the pregnancy may be terminated, subject to consent.

Most other Ashkenazi Jewish communities also run screening programs because of the higher incidence of genetic diseases. In some Jewish communities, the ancient custom of matchmaking (shidduch) is still practiced, and some matchmakers require blood tests so that they can avoid making matches between individuals who share the same recessive disease traits. In order to attempt to prevent the tragedy of infant death which always results from being homozygous for Tay–Sachs, associations such as the strongly observant Dor Yeshorim (which was founded by Rabbi Joseph Ekstein, who lost four children to the disease) with the purpose of preventing others from suffering the same tragedy test young couples to check whether they carry a risk of passing on fatal conditions.

If both the young man and woman are Tay–Sachs carriers, it is common for the match to be broken off. Judaism,[dubious – discuss] like numerous other religions, discourages abortion unless there is a risk to the woman, in which case her needs take precedence. The effort is not aimed at eradicating the hereditary traits, but rather at the occurrence of homozygosity. The actual impact of this program on allele frequencies is unknown, but little impact would be expected because the program does not impose genetic selection. Instead, it encourages disassortative mating.

Which ideas should be described as ""eugenic"" are still controversial. Bio-ethicists Stephen Wilkinson and Eve Garrard note that due to its history, ""there's no overwhelming argument for completely abandoning the term 'eugenics', but concerns remain about ambiguity, confusion and manipulation, and the consequent failure to respect people's autonomy."" The pair argue that anyone using the term ""must at least be clear about what they mean by it and be prepared to offer a clear definition. Otherwise unnecessary confusion and disagreement may ensue.""[186]

Modern inquiries into the potential use of genetic engineering have led to an increased invocation of the history of eugenics in discussions of bioethics, most often as a cautionary tale. Some suggest that even non-coercive eugenics programs are inherently unethical.[187]

James D. Watson, the first director of the Human Genome Project, initiated the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications Program (ELSI) which has funded a number of studies into the implications of human genetic engineering (along with a prominent website on the history of eugenics), because:

In putting ethics so soon into the genome agenda, I was responding to my own personal fear that all too soon critics of the Genome Project would point out that I was a representative of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that once housed the controversial Eugenics Record Office. My not forming a genome ethics program quickly might be falsely used as evidence that I was a closet eugenicist, having as my real long-term purpose the unambiguous identification of genes that lead to social and occupational stratification as well as genes justifying racial discrimination.[188]

Philosopher Philip Kitcher, writing in 1997, has described the use of genetic screening by parents as making possible a form of ""voluntary"" eugenics.[189] In 2006, Richard Dawkins stated that breeding humans for traits is possible and society should not be afraid to debate the ethical differences between breeding a child for an ability versus forcing a child to gain an ability through training.[190]

Historian Nathaniel C. Comfort wrote in 2012, ""The eugenic impulse drives us to eliminate disease, live longer and healthier, with greater intelligence, and a better adjustment to the conditions of society.""[191] Comfort claims, ""the health benefits, the intellectual thrill and the profits of genetic biomedicine are too great for us to do otherwise.""[191]

Bill McKibben suggests that emerging reprogenetic technologies would be disproportionately available to those with greater financial resources, thereby exacerbating the gap between rich and poor and creating a ""genetic divide"".[192] Lee M. Silver, a biologist and science writer who coined the term ""reprogenetics"" and supports its applications, has expressed concern that these methods could create a two-tiered society of genetically-engineered ""haves"" and ""have nots"" if social democratic reforms lag behind implementation of reprogenetic technologies.[193]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_eugenics
History of Belarus,"The lands of Belarus during the Middle Ages became part of Kievan Rus' and were split between different regional principalities, including Polotsk, Turov, Vitebsk, and others. Following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, these lands were absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which later was merged into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 16th century.

Following the Partitions of Poland in the 18th century, Belarusian territories became part of the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, different states arose competing for legitimacy amid the Russian Civil War, ultimately ending with the consolidation of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union when it was founded in 1922.

The republic was devastated as a result of the German occupation during World War II, and its territory was expanded after Western Belorussia was annexed by the Soviet Union as a result of the war. Belarus became an independent state in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Archaeological discoveries show what is now Belarus had human inhabitants during the Paleolithic and Neolithic ages.[1]

The history of Belarus begins with the migration and expansion of the Slavic peoples through Eastern Europe between the 6th and 8th centuries. East Slavs settled on the territory of present-day Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, assimilating local Baltic (Yotvingians, Dnieper Balts), Finns (in Russia) and steppe nomads (in Ukraine) already living there, their early ethnic integrations contributed to the gradual differentiation of the East Slavs. These East Slavs, pagan, animistic, agrarian people, had an economy which included trade in agricultural produce, game, furs, honey, beeswax and amber.

The modern Belarusian ethnos was probably formed on the basis of the three Slavic tribes—Kryvians, Drehovians, and Radzimians—as well as several Baltic tribes.[2]

The common cultural bond of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and written Church Slavonic (a literary and liturgical Slavic language developed by 8th-century missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius) fostered the emergence of a new geopolitical entity, Kievan Rus' — a loose-knit multi-ethnic network of principalities,[3] established along pre-existing trade routes, with major centers in Novgorod (now in Russia), Polotsk (now in Belarus) and Kiev (now in Ukraine).

Between the 9th and 12th centuries, the Principality of Polotsk (now in northern Belarus) emerged as the dominant center of power in the territory of Belarus, while the Principality of Turov south of it was a lesser power.

The Principality of Polotsk repeatedly asserted its sovereignty in relation to the other centers of Rus', becoming a political capital, the episcopal see of a bishopric and the controller of vassal territories among Balts in the west. The city's Cathedral of the Holy Wisdom (1044–66), though completely rebuilt over the years, remains a symbol of this independent-mindedness, rivaling churches of the same name in Novgorod and Kiev, referring to the original Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (and hence to claims of imperial prestige, authority and sovereignty). Cultural achievements of the Polotsk period include the work of the nun Euphrosyne of Polotsk (1120–1173), who built monasteries, transcribed books, promoted literacy and sponsored art (including local artisan Lazar Bohsha's famous ""Cross of Euphrosyne"", a national symbol and treasure stolen during World War II), and the prolific, original Church Slavonic sermons and writings of Bishop Kirill of Turov (1130–1182).

In the 13th century, the fragile unity of Kievan Rus' disintegrated due to nomadic incursions from Asia, which climaxed with the Mongol sacking of Kiev in 1240, leaving a geopolitical vacuum in the region. The East Slavs had splintered into a number of independent and competing principalities. Due to military conquest and dynastic marriages, the western principalities of Rus' in modern Belarus were acquired by the expanding Grand Duchy of Lithuania, beginning with the rule of Lithuanian King Mindaugas (1240–1263). From the 13th to 15th century, the principalities were either conquered or willingly joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

The Lithuanians' smaller numbers in this medieval state gave the Ruthenians (later Belarusians and Ukrainians) an important role in the everyday cultural life of the state.[citation needed] Owing to the prevalence of East Slavs and the Eastern Orthodox faith among the population in eastern and southern regions of the state, the Ruthenian language was a widely used colloquial language.

The East Slavic variety of the language (rus'ka mova, Old Belarusian or West Russian Chancellery language), gradually influenced by Polish, was the language of administration in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from at least Vytautas' reign until the late 17th century when it was replaced by Polish.[4]

This period of political breakdown and reorganization also saw the rise of written local vernaculars in place of the literary and liturgical Church Slavonic language, a further stage in the evolving differentiation between the Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian languages.

Several Lithuanian monarchs — the last being Švitrigaila in 1432–36 — relied on the Eastern Orthodox Ruthenian majority, while most monarchs and magnates increasingly came to reflect the opinions of the Roman Catholics.

Construction of Orthodox churches in some parts of present-day Belarus had been initially prohibited, as was the case in Vitebsk in 1480. On the other hand, further unification of the mostly Orthodox Grand Duchy with mostly Catholic Poland led to liberalization and a partial solving of the religious problem. In 1511, King and Grand Duke Sigismund I the Old granted the Orthodox clergy an autonomy previously enjoyed only by Catholic clergy. The privilege was enhanced in 1531, when the Orthodox church was no longer responsible to the Catholic bishop and instead the metropolitan was responsible only to the sobor of eight Orthodox bishops, the Grand Duke and the Patriarch of Constantinople. The privilege also extended the jurisdiction of the Orthodox hierarchy over all Orthodox people.[5]

In such circumstances, a vibrant Ruthenian culture flourished, mostly in the major cities of present-day Belarus.[6]
Despite the legal usage of the Ruthenian language, which was used as a chancellery language in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, literature was mostly non-existent, apart from several chronicles.

The Union of Lublin in 1569 led to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to become an influential player in European politics and the largest multinational state in Europe. While present-day Ukraine and Podlaskie became subjects of the Polish Crown, present-day Belarusian territories were still regarded as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The new polity was dominated by densely populated Poland, which had 134 representatives in the Sejm as compared to 46 representatives from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania retained significant autonomy, and was governed by a separate code of laws called the Lithuanian Statutes, which codified both civil and property rights. Of the territory of present-day Belarus, Mogilev was the largest urban centre, followed by Vitebsk, Polotsk, Pinsk, Slutsk, and Brest, whose population exceeded 10,000. In addition, Vilna (Vilnius), the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, also had a significant Ruthenian population.[7]

With time, the ethnic pattern did not evolve much. Throughout their existence as a separate culture, Ruthenians formed in most cases the rural population, with power held by the local szlachta and boyars, often of Lithuanian, Polish or Russian descent. By this time, a significant Jewish presence had also formed in this region of German Jews fleeing persecution from the Northern and Baltic Crusaders.  Since the Union of Horodlo of 1413, the local nobility was assimilated into the traditional clan system by means of the formal procedure of adoption by the szlachta (Polish gentry).[citation needed] Eventually, it formed a significant part of the szlachta. Initially[when?] mostly Ruthenian and Orthodox,[citation needed] with time most of them became polonized. This was especially true for major magnate families (Sapieha and Radziwiłł clans being the most notable), whose personal fortunes and properties often surpassed those of the royal families and were huge enough to be called a state within a state.

Also, with time religious conflicts started to arise. The gentry with time started to adopt Catholicism while the common people by large remained faithful to Eastern Orthodoxy. Initially the Warsaw Compact of 1573 codified the preexisting freedom of worship. However, the rule of an ultra-Catholic King Sigismund III Vasa was marked by numerous attempts to spread Catholicism, mostly through his support for counterreformation and the Jesuits. Possibly to avoid such conflicts, in 1595 the Orthodox hierarchs of Kiev signed the Union of Brest, breaking their links with the Patriarch of Constantinople and placing themselves under the Pope. Although the union was generally supported by most local Orthodox bishops and the king himself, it was opposed by some prominent nobles and, more importantly, by the nascent Cossack movement. This led to a series of conflicts and rebellions against the local authorities. The first of such happened in 1595, when the Cossack insurgents under Severyn Nalyvaiko took the towns of Slutsk and Mogilev and executed Polish magistrates there. Other such clashes took place in Mogilev (1606–10), Vitebsk (1623), and Polotsk (1623, 1633).[8] This left the population of the Grand Duchy divided between Greek Catholic and Greek Orthodox parts. At the same time, after the schism in the Orthodox Church (Raskol), some Old Believers migrated west, seeking refuge in the Rzeczpospolita, which allowed them to freely practice their faith.[9]

From 1569, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth suffered a series of Tatar raids, the goal of which was to loot, pillage and capture slaves into jasyr. The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi-permanent warfare until the 18th century. Some researchers estimate that altogether more than 3 million people, predominantly Ukrainians but also Russians, Belarusians and Poles, were captured and enslaved during the time of the Crimean Khanate.[citation needed]

Despite these conflicts, the literary tradition of Belarus evolved. Until the 17th century, the Ruthenian language, the predecessor of modern Belarusian, was used in the Grand Duchy as a chancery language, that is, the language used for official documents. Afterwards, it was replaced with the Polish language, commonly spoken by the upper classes. Both Polish and Ruthenian cultures gained a major cultural centre with the foundation of the Academy of Vilna. At the same time, the Belarusian lands entered a path of economic growth, with the formation of numerous towns that served as centres of trade on the east–west routes.[citation needed]

Eventually, by 1795, Poland was partitioned by its neighbors. Thus, a new period in Belarusian history began, with all its lands annexed by the Russian Empire.

Under Russian administration, the territory of Belarus was divided into the governorates (guberniyas) of Minsk, Vitebsk, Mogilev, and Grodno. Belarusians were active in the guerrilla movement against Napoleon's occupation.[10] With Napoleon's defeat, Belarus again became a part of Imperial Russia and its guberniyas constituted part of the Northwestern Krai. The independence seeking 1830 and 1863 uprisings of the gentry were subdued by the government forces.[11]

Although under Nicholas I and Alexander III the national cultures were repressed due to the policies of de-Polonization[12] and Russification,[11] which included the return to Orthodoxy, the 19th century signifies the rise of the modern Belarusian nation and self-confidence. A number of authors started publishing in the Belarusian language, including Jan Czeczot, Władysław Syrokomla and Konstanty Kalinowski. In 1862-1863 Kalinowski published first newspaper in modern Belarusian language, Mużyckaja prauda (Peasants' Truth), in a Latin script.[13]

In the second half of the 19th century, the Belarusian economy, like that of the entire Europe, was experiencing significant growth due to the spread of the Industrial Revolution to Eastern Europe,[14] particularly after the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and the construction of railways in the late 19th century (with Minsk, Vitebsk, Grodno, Pinsk and Gomel becoming significant industrial centres.[15]

On 21 February 1918, Minsk was captured by German troops. World War I was the short period when Belarusian culture started to flourish. German administration allowed schools with Belarusian language, previously banned in Russia; a number of Belarusian schools were created until 1919 when they were banned again by the Polish military administration.[citation needed] At the end of World War I, when Belarus was still occupied by Germans, according to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the short-lived People's Republic of Belarus was pronounced on 25 March 1918, as part of the German Mitteleuropa plan.

In December 1918, Mitteleuropa was obsolete as the German Empire withdrew from the Ober-Ost territory, and for the next few years in the newly created power vacuum the territories of Belarus would witness the struggle of various national and foreign factions. On 3 December 1918 the Germans withdrew from Minsk. On 10 December 1918 Soviet troops occupied Minsk. The Rada (Council) of the People's Republic of Belarus went into exile, first to Kaunas, then to Berlin and finally to Prague. On 2 January 1919, the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia was declared. On 17 February 1919 it was disbanded. Part of it was included into Russian SFSR, and part was joined to the Lithuanian SSR to form the LBSSR, Lithuanian–Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, informally known as Litbel, whose capital was Vilnius. While Belarus National Republic faced off with Litbel, foreign powers were preparing to reclaim what they saw as their territories: Polish forces were moving from the West, and Russians from the East. When Vilnius was captured by Polish forces on 17 April 1919, the capital of the Soviet puppet state Litbel was moved to Minsk. On 17 July 1919 Lenin dissolved Litbel because of the pressure of Polish forces advancing from the West. Polish troops captured Minsk on 8 August 1919.

The Republic of Central Lithuania was a short-lived political entity within a territory now split between modern Lithuania and Belarus. It was the last attempt to restore Lithuania in the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower). The republic was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division of the Polish Army under Lucjan Żeligowski. Centered on the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vilna (Lithuanian: Vilnius, Polish: Wilno), for 18 months the entity served as a buffer state between Poland, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area.[16] After a variety of delays, a disputed election took place on 8 January 1922, and the territory was annexed to Poland. Żeligowski later in his memoir which was published in London in 1943 condemned the annexation of Republic by Poland, as well as the policy of closing Belarusian schools and general disregard of Marshal Józef Piłsudski's confederation plans by Polish ally.[17]

Some time in 1918 or 1919, Sergiusz Piasecki returned to Belarus, joining Belarusian anti-Soviet units, the ""Green Oak"" (in Polish, Zielony Dąb), led by Ataman Wiaczesław Adamowicz (pseudonym: J. Dziergacz). When on 8 August 1919, the Polish Army captured Minsk, Adamowicz decided to work with them. Thus Belarusian units were created, and Piasecki was transferred to a Warsaw school of infantry cadets. In the summer of 1920, during the Polish–Soviet War, Piasecki fought in the Battle of Radzymin.

The frontiers between Poland, which had established an independent government after World War I, and the former Russian Empire were not recognized by the League of Nations. Poland's Józef Piłsudski, who envisioned the formation of an Intermarium federation as a Central and East European bloc that would be a bulwark against Germany to the west and Russia to the east, carried out a Kiev offensive into Ukraine in 1920. This met with a Red Army counter-offensive that drove into Polish territory almost to Warsaw, Minsk itself was re-captured by the Soviet Red Army on 11 July 1920 and a new Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was declared on 31 July 1920. Piłsudski, however, halted the Soviet advance at the Battle of Warsaw and resumed his eastward offensive. Finally the Treaty of Riga, ending the Polish–Soviet War, divided Belarus between Poland and Soviet Russia. Over the next two years, the People's Republic of Belarus prepared a national uprising, ceasing the preparations only when the League of Nations recognized the Soviet Union's western borders on 15 March 1923. The Soviets terrorised Western Belarus, the most radical case being Soviet raid on Stołpce. Poland created Border Protection Corps in 1924.

The Polish part of Belarus was subject to Polonization policies (especially in the 1930s), while the Soviet Belarus was one of the original republics which formed the USSR. For several years, the national culture and language enjoyed a significant boost of revival in the Soviet Belarus[citation needed]. A Polish Autonomous District was also formed. This was however soon ended during the Great Purge, when almost all prominent Belarusian national intelligentsia were executed, many of them buried in Kurapaty. Thousands were deported to Asia. As the result of Polish operation of the NKVD tens of thousands people of many nationalities were killed. Belarusian orthography was Russified in 1933 and use of Belarusian language was discouraged as exhibiting anti-soviet attitude.[18]

In West Belarus, up to 30,000 families of Polish veterans (osadniks) were settled in the lands formerly belonging to the Russian tsar family and Russian aristocracy.[19] Belarusian representation in Polish parliament was reduced as a result of the 1930 elections. Since the early 1930s, the Polish government introduced a set of policies designed to Polonize all minorities (Belarusians, Ukrainians, Jews, etc.)[citation needed]. The usage of Belarusian language was discouraged and the Belarusian schools were facing severe financial problems. In spring of 1939, there already was neither single Belarusian official organisation in Poland nor a single exclusively Belarusian school (with only 44 schools teaching Belarusian language left).[20]

When the Soviet Union invaded Poland on September 17, 1939, following the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol, Western Byelorussia, which was part of Poland, is included in the BSSR. Similarly to the times of German occupation during World War I, Belarusian language and Soviet culture enjoyed relative prosperity in this short period. Already in October 1940, over 75% of schools used the Belarusian language, also in the regions where no Belarus people lived, e.g. around Łomża, what was Ruthenization.[21] Western Belarus was sovietised, tens of thousands were imprisoned in Gulag camps, exiled and many were executed as ""enemies of the people"". The victims were mostly Polish and Jewish.[22][23]

After twenty months of Soviet rule, Nazi Germany and its Axis allies invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Soviet authorities immediately evacuated about 20% of the population of Belarus, killed thousands of prisoners and destroyed all the food supplies.[24] The country suffered particularly heavily during the fighting and the German occupation. Minsk was captured by the Germans on 28 June 1941. Following bloody encirclement battles, all of the present-day Belarus territory was occupied by the Germans by the end of August 1941.

During World War II, the Nazis attempted to establish a puppet Belarusian government, Belarusian Central Rada, with the symbolics similar to BNR. In reality, however, the Germans imposed a brutal racist regime, burning down some 9,000 Belarusian villages, deporting some 380,000 people for slave labour, and killing hundreds of thousands of civilians more. Local police took part in many of those crimes. Almost the whole, previously very numerous, Jewish populations of Belarus that did not evacuate were killed. One of the first uprisings of a Jewish ghetto against the Nazis occurred in 1942 in Belarus, in the small town of Lakhva.

Since the early days of the occupation, a powerful and increasingly well-coordinated Belarusian resistance movement emerged. Hiding in the woods and swamps, the partisans inflicted heavy damage to German supply lines and communications, disrupting railway tracks, bridges, telegraph wires, attacking supply depots, fuel dumps and transports and ambushing German soldiers. Not all anti-German partisans were pro-Soviet.[25] In the largest[citation needed] partisan sabotage action of the entire Second World War, the so-called Asipovichy diversion of 30 July 1943 four German trains with supplies and Tiger tanks were destroyed. To fight partisan activity, the Germans had to withdraw considerable forces behind their front line. On 22 June 1944 the huge Soviet offensive Operation Bagration was launched, Minsk was re-captured on 3 July 1944, and all of Belarus was regained by the end of August. Hundred thousand of Poles were expelled after 1944. As part of the Nazis' effort to combat the enormous Belarusian resistance during World War II, special units of local collaborationists were trained by the SS's Otto Skorzeny to infiltrate the Soviet rear. In 1944 thirty Belarusians (known as Čorny Kot (Black Cat) and personally led by Michał Vituška) were airdropped by the Luftwaffe behind the lines of the Red Army, which had already liberated Belarus during Operation Bagration. They experienced some initial success due to disorganization in the rear of the Red Army, and some other German-trained Belarusian nationalist units also slipped through the Białowieża Forest in 1945. The NKVD, however, had already infiltrated these units. Vituška himself was hunted down, captured and executed, although he continued to live on in Belarusian nationalist hagiography.[26]

In total, Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population in World War II including practically all its intellectual elite. About 9,200 villages and 1.2 million houses were destroyed. The major towns of Minsk and Vitsebsk lost over 80% of their buildings and city infrastructure. For the defence against the Germans, and the tenacity during the German occupation, the capital Minsk was awarded the title Hero City after the war. The fortress of Brest was awarded the title Hero-Fortress.

After the end of War in 1945, Belarus became one of the founding members of the United Nations Organisation. Joining Belarus was the Soviet Union itself and another republic Ukraine. In exchange for Belarus and Ukraine joining the UN, the United States had the right to seek two more votes, a right that has never been exercised.[27]

More than 200,000 ethnic Poles left or were expelled to Poland in late 1940s and late 1950s, some killed by the NKVD or deported to Siberia.[citation needed] [28] Armia Krajowa and post-AK resistance was the strongest in the Grodno, Vawkavysk, Lida and Shchuchyn regions.[29]

The Belarusian economy was completely devastated by the events of the war. Most of the industry, including whole production plants were removed either to Russia or Germany. Industrial production of Belarus in 1945 amounted for less than 20% of its pre-war size. Most of the factories evacuated to Russia, with several spectacular exceptions, were not returned to Belarus after 1945. During the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union first rebuilt and then expanded the BSSR's economy, with control always exerted exclusively from Moscow. During this time, Belarus became a major center of manufacturing in the western region of the USSR. Huge industrial objects like the BelAZ, MAZ, and the Minsk Tractor Plant were built in the country. The increase in jobs resulted in a huge immigrant population of Russians in Belarus. Russian became the official language of administration and the peasant class, which traditionally was the base for Belarusian nation, ceased to exist.[18]

On 26 April 1986, the Chernobyl disaster occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine situated close to the border with Belarus. It is regarded as the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power. It produced a plume of radioactive debris that drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia. Large areas of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia were contaminated, resulting in the evacuation and resettlement of roughly 200,000 people. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus. The effects of the Chernobyl accident in Belarus were dramatic: about 50,000 km2 (or about a quarter of the territory of Belarus) formerly populated by 2.2 million people (or a fifth of the Belarusian population) now require permanent radioactive monitoring (after receiving doses over 37 kBq/m2 of caesium-137). 135,000 persons were permanently resettled and many more were resettled temporarily. After 10 years since the accident, the occurrences of thyroid cancer among children increased fifteenfold (the sharp rise started in about four years after the accident).[30]

On 27 July 1990, Belarus declared its national sovereignty, a key step toward independence from the Soviet Union. Around that time, Stanislav Shushkevich became the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, the top leadership position in Belarus.

On 25 August 1991, after the failure of the August Coup in Moscow, Belarus declared full independence from the USSR by granting the declaration of state sovereignty a constitutional status that it did not have before.[31]

On 8 December 1991, Shushkevich met with Boris Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, in Belavezhskaya Pushcha, to formally declare the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

Post-Soviet countries have signed a series of treaties and agreements to settle the legacy of the former Soviet Union multilaterally and bilaterally.

A new Belarusian constitution enacted in early 1994 paved the way for the first democratic presidential election on 23 June and 10 July. Alexander Lukashenko was elected president of Belarus. Having assumed the rights and responsibilities of the Soviet Union on the territory of Byelarus,[32] in December 1994 Lukashenko signed the Budapest Memorandum along with Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States acting as guarantors and thereby denuclearized the nation.[33][34][35][36]

The 1996 referendum resulted in amendments to the constitution that removed key powers from the parliament.

In 1999 opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar disappeared and were presumably killed. In 2001,  Lukashenko was re-elected as president in elections described as undemocratic by Western observers. At the same time, the west began criticizing him as authoritarian. In 2006, Lukashenko was once again re-elected in presidential elections again criticized as flawed by most European Union countries.

In 2010, Lukashenko was re-elected once again in presidential elections which were again described as falsified by most EU countries and organizations such as the OSCE. A peaceful protest against the electoral flaws turned into a riot when demonstrators tried to storm a government building. The police used batons to quell the riot. Seven presidential candidates and hundreds of rioters were arrested by KGB.[37]

Lukashenko's disputed victory in the country's 2020 presidential election led to widespread allegations of vote rigging, which strongly amplified anti-government protests, the largest during his rule.[38] Protesters have faced violent persecution by the authorities. A statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office on 1 September cited more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, as well as reports of sexual abuse and rape.[39] Several protesters were killed. Following the contested election, Lukashenko is not recognized by the United Kingdom, the European Union, or the United States as the legitimate president of Belarus.[40][41]

On 23 May 2021, Ryanair Flight 4978 was diverted by the Belarusian government to Minsk National Airport, where two of its passengers, opposition activist and former editor-in-chief of the Telegram channel Nexta Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, were arrested by authorities.[42] In summer of the same year, Belarusian authorities organized the 2021–2022 Belarus–European Union border crisis consisting of an influx of tens of thousands of immigrants, primarily from Iraqi Kurdistan, to Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland via those countries' borders with Belarus.[43]

Belarus allowed its territory to be used by the Russian army in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to stage and launch forces from the north into Ukraine.[44]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Belarus

Lithuanian Reserve Battalion,"The Lithuanian Reserve Battalion (Lithuanian: Lietuvių atsargos batalionas) was a Lithuanian unit of the Russian Army that operated in Smolensk from late 1917 to early 1918.[1] This battalion was one of the first 20th-century Lithuanian military units, together with the Lithuanian Dragoon Half-Regiment.[1]

In historiography, the unit has also been called the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion in Smolensk (Lithuanian: Lietuvių atsargos batalionas Smolenske).[2]

The unit began to be formed in late 1917 – early 1918 under the care of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Soldiers' Union in Smolensk.[1] Smolensk was the place where the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion was organised because it was further away from the Eastern Front.[1] The city also had warehouses of war supplies and a large concentration of Lithuanian war refugees.[1] The Lithuanian community in Smolensk supported the battalion with its own funds throughout its existence.[2]

On 19 November 1917, the Ministry of War of Russia gave permission to form a Lithuanian infantry regiment.[2] However, due to the beginning of the October coup, work briefly stopped and resumed only on December 5, when the commander of the Minsk military district ordered the formation of a Lithuanian reserve battalion that was 4 companies strong.[2] This meant that instead of a regiment, only a reserve battalion was allowed to be formed.[1] The commander of the Minsk military district also ordered that all of the district's Lithuanian soldiers be sent to the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion.[1] The battalion actually started functioning only on December 15, when Jasaitis, the owner of the Vilija factory, gave horses, carriages, kitchen and other things to it.[2] Colonel Jurgis Kubilius was appointed as the battalion's commander.[1]

From January 1918, the number of soldiers greatly increased and the 600-man strong battalion was fully formed that month.[1][2] It had four infantry companies, supply and communications units.[1] The soldiers were taught courses about Lithuanian language, Lithuanian history, geography, in addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic.[1] The education was nationally oriented.[1]

Service in the battalion was difficult for the soldiers not only because of poverty but also because of the Bolshevik agitation led by R. Rasikas.[2] The Bolshevik authorities demanded that an election of commanders be held and a battalion committee be elected.[2] However, the Lithuanian soldiers behaved in a principled manner and elected all former commanding officers into their former positions.[2] Dissatisfied with such behaviour by the soldiers, the Bolsheviks stopped providing supplies or paying salaries to the battalion.[2] The officers lived and ate together with the soldiers.[2]

After the announcement of the demobilization of the Russian army on 31 January 1918, an attempt was made by the Bolshevik authorities to include the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion in the army of Soviet Russia.[1] Due to the refusal of the battalion command, the supply of food and ammunition was cut off to the battalion was cut off on February 8.[1]

After failing to incite the battalion to join the ranks of the Red Army, the Bolsheviks began to threaten to liquidate it.[2] Not wanting the soldiers to suffer, the Lithuanian officers decided to disband the battalion.[2] On 5 March 1918, an order was received from the headquarters of the Minsk Military District to demobilize the battalion's soldiers, and a liquidation commission was appointed.[1]

Some of the soldiers went to Lithuania before April 8, most of whom joined the Lithuanian Army, while others transferred to the Red Army.[1]

At least 18 future volunteers of the Lithuanian Army served in the Lithuanian Reserve Battalion: Divisional General Jurgis Kubilius, Colonel Mykolas Kalmantas, Lieutenant Colonel Kleopas Mikalauskas, Reserve Captains Liudas Žukauskas, Petras Šernas, Reserve Lieutenants Emilis Šneideraitis, Petras Gureckas, Reserve Officers Paulius Pranckūnas and Kazys Nasevičius, Reserve Corporals Bronius Grudzinskas and Jonas Keleris, Reserve Non-Commissioned Officers Stasys Butkus and Jonas Avėnas, Reserve Junior Non-commissioned Officer Stasys Čepauskas, Reserve Privates Petras Bugailiškis, Feliksas Zaremba, Jonas Butkys and Mykolas Paulavičius.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Reserve_Battalion
Lithuania Davis Cup team,"The Lithuania men's national tennis team represents Lithuania in Davis Cup tennis competition and are governed by the Lithuanian Tennis Association.

Lithuania has never been a tennis country – no tennis player from Lithuania entered ATP top 500 until 2008. However, the situation is changing in recent years. Currently young Lithuanian players are winning the greatest tennis victories in the history of Lithuania. As expected, this led to the increasing popularity of tennis in the country. Now, Lithuania has a few very high quality players.

In 2012 Lithuania competed in the third group of Davis Cup, where they won all three ties and got promoted to the second group. It played seven times  there. Also, it has competed in the third group for 13 times. And once have been promoted to group one, where Lithuania team is currently playing.

Player information and rankings as of 8 March 2015[update]

Lithuania started its Davis Cup history in 1994 with competing in the Europe and Africa zone of Group III.

Lithuania started 2009 Davis Cup with their first ever victory in Group II. In the first round, Lithuania defeated Georgia 3–2[1] in front of a home crowd in a recently built SEB arena. All work was done by the youngest members of the Lithuanian team – 18-year-old Ričardas Berankis won both of his singles matches[2][3] and 16-year-old Dovydas Šakinis defeated the leader of Georgian team Irakli Labadze in the decisive rubber.[4] For the second round match-up, Lithuania went to Otočec to play against Slovenia. However, the Slovenian team with Grega Žemlja and Blaž Kavčič was too strong for Lithuania, which won only one set in five matches, and the tie ended 0–5.[5][6]

In 2010 Lithuania had its better performance. For the first round match-up Lithuania drew the top seeded British team in Lithuania. With James Ward defeating Laurynas Grigelis, Great Britain winning the doubles match and Berankis winning both of his singles matches the tie came to the decisive rubber. Grigelis won a five-setter against Daniel Evans[7] and against all odds Lithuania celebrated a 3–2[8] victory over Great Britain.[9][10] Lithuania's next round was against Irish team led by Conor Niland and James McGee in Dublin. Lithuania celebrated after the second day when Berankis and Grigelis won the first three matches and secured the tie.[11] Ireland won the remaining dead rubbers with Lithuania winning the tie 3–2.[12][13] In the third round Lithuania had a rematch of last year's tie against Slovenia, only this time Slovenian team came to Vilnius. The best two Lithuanian tennis players Berankis and Grigelis represented Lithuania in all five matches but they won only two of them – Berankis defeated Blaž Kavčič in the first rubber and Lithuania came back from two sets to love down in the doubles match. Eventually, Lithuania ended up losing 2–3[14] and Slovenia was promoted to the first group.[15]

Lithuania came into the 2011 Davis Cup with high hopes but the dreams were crashed in the first round tie against Estonia in Tallinn. During the second rubber Grigelis got a knee injury and not only lost the match but also had to skip the remaining tie.[16] Grigelis was replaced by Dovydas Šakinis who was still recovering from pneumonia so couldn't play his best tennis. Although Berankis won both of his singles matches,[17] Lithuania lost the tie 2–3.[18][19] The fourth rubber between Berankis and Jürgen Zopp took 3 hours 46 minutes and it was the longest rubber for both teams in their histories. After the first round loss Lithuania faced a relegation play-off against Morocco in Vilnius, where neither Berankis[20] nor Grigelis[21] helped Lithuania. The Lithuanian team, with only one ranked player and all players being under 19, lost to Morocco 0-5[22][23] which led to the relegation to the third group for the following year.

In 2012, Lithuania was competing in Group III. In the group stage Lithuania defeated Andorra and San Marino without losing a set. For the promotion play-off Lithuania faced the Greek team. In the first rubber Grigelis lost a tough match to Theodoros Angelinos but Berankis restored the parity by defeating Paris Gemouchidis. In the decisive rubber, Lithuanian leaders won a doubles match and the tie ended 2–1. Lithuania got promoted to the Group II for the following year.[24]

In 2013, Lithuania was drawn to play against Cyprus in the first round of the Europe/Africa Zone Group II.

In 2014 Lithuania team defeated South Africa, Norway and Bosnia and Herzegovina and was promoted to Europe/Africa Zone Group I for the first time in 2015.

Statesmen (conspiracy theory),"The Statesmen, or Statesmen Clan (Lithuanian: ""valstybininkai"", ""valstybininkų"" klanas, generally written with quote marks) is a conspiracy theory which claims that a deep state of unelected officials, based in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the State Security Department of Lithuania (VSD), seeks to influence the actions of elected officials, protect each other in power and take control of Lithuania.[1] The conspiracy theory emerged in 2006, after the death of VSD officer Vytautas Pociūnas in Belarus, who the theory claims was a whistleblower of the clan's activities.[2] The conspiracy theory was promoted by politicians in the Homeland Union (TS-LKD).[1]

Though primarily connected with investigations from 2006 to 2010, the theory has experienced a revival since 2019, after opponents of the Homeland Union claimed that the ""clan"" remains active and is pressuring the Šimonytė Cabinet.[3]

According to Valdas Vasiliauskas, editor-in-chief of Lietuvos žinios (later a Member of the Seimas for the Way of Courage party), the Statesmen are ""a clan-like group of persons connected by constant mutual relations, distribution of roles and tasks among group members"", it is a highly organized and hierarchical organization (Vasiliauskas identified Albinas Januška as its leader), has control of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the State Security Department, the President of Lithuania, the military, police, the political sciences faculty of Vilnius University and is connected with the courts, political parties and the media.[5]

Pociūnas was generally described as a whistleblower, a VSD official who was aware of the conspiracy and was killed for attempting to reveal it to the media. The specific information differed. In 2008, Vasiliauskas claimed that Pociūnas investigated the connections between the ""Statesmen"" and the energy company Dujotekana, as well as the company's influence in government institutions.[5] Later, in 2014, he claimed that Pociūnas was aware about the CIA black site in Antaviliai, near Vilnius, and the alleged bribes to VSD officials which allowed its creation.[6]

It had been alleged that the ""Statesmen"" were responsible for the fall of Brazauskas Cabinet II and convinced members of the Labour Party to support the formation of the Kirkilas Cabinet.[1] Viktor Uspaskich accused ""statesmen"" of attempting to destroy his political career and his party via Labour's ""dark accounting"" case.[7] Rolandas Paksas, President of Lithuania impeached in 2004, claimed that he opposed the ""statesmen"" during his presidency and was removed for refusing to allow the establishment of the Antaviliai CIA black site.[8] In 2007, he claimed that ""statesmen"" conspired to raise attention towards LGBT rights in Lithuania to distract attention from their case.[9]

According to Rasa Juknevičienė, Member of the Seimas from the Homeland Union, the deep state emerged after the 1998 Russian financial crisis and the 2000 Lithuanian parliamentary election, which spurned a group of individuals to ""take the reins of the state to their hands"" with Russian financial support.[10] Vasiliauskas claimed that the conspiracy formed as early as 1990, within the deputies of the Supreme Council of Lithuania, also known as the Reconstituent Seimas, including members of the former Communist Party of Lithuania.[5] Antanas Valionis claimed that ""TS-LKD campaign against the so-called Statesmen"" could have been motivated by the struggles of business groups in the energy sector in 2000–2006 and VSD investigations into previous unexplained violent acts, such as the Bražuolė bridge bombing in 1994 and the bombing of the editorial office of Lietuvos rytas in 1995. According to the politician, the TS-LKD interpreted this as a conspiracy against them.[11]

Though the pejorative term ""valstybininkas"" (""Statesman"", meaning an official who belongs to a group of influential figures seeking personal gain) has been used in Lithuanian media since at least 2005,[12] the conspiracy theory emerged after Vytautas Pociūnas, a VSD officer stationed in Brest, Belarus, was found dead after falling out of the window of Hotel Intourist on 23 August 2006.[13] The death was ruled an accident, but it was rumoured that Pociūnas was killed for his alleged investigations into a deep state within the Lithuanian government and institutions, and their anti-state activities.[2] It became more prominent after an investigation into Pociūnas' death by the State Prosecutor's Office was closed in late 2006 after a very quick investigation (including a claim that Pociūnas fell out of a window while urinating, which was interpreted as a smear campaign),[14] and after an Ekstra magazine interview of VSD deputy director Darius Jurgelevičius in September 2006, in which he commented on the public interest in the Pociūnas case:

There are many nuances and details. And if all this rummaging around in those bones continues, moments that will not add honor to the whole thing will start to emerge. I think someone is trying to make a big show, but the result, I believe, will be disappointing. Unfortunate.[15]

Numerous protests were held in support of Pociūnas and his surviving family, and the final annual commemoration of his death was held in 2016.[16] The death was also followed by an investigation by the Seimas National Security and Defense Committee (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos Seimo nacionalinio saugumo ir gynybos komitetas, NSGK) into VSD activity, initiated by Homeland Union Member of the Seimas Rasa Juknevičienė.[17]

On 4 December 2006, NSGK published their conclusion on the activities of the State Security Department. 33 active (in December 2006) and 4 former VSD officials, Seimas members Andrius Kubilius, Jurgis Razma, Antanas Valionis, former secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Albinas Januška, former Director General of VSD, ambassador to Spain Mečys Laurinkus, consul general in Grodno Daiva Mockuvienė, television journalist Joana Lapėnienė, Vytautas Pociūnas's wife Liudvika Pociūnienė and brother Algimantas Pociūnas, and signatory of the Act of March 11 Algirdas Endriukaitis testified before the committee.[18]

The investigation was controversial. Januška resigned from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claiming that he is unable to answer public criticism while keeping state secrets, but was immediately reappointed as advisor to Gediminas Kirkilas. NSGK members unsuccessfully demanded certificates from the VSD related to possible corrupt connections of high-ranking officials. Refused, the politicians turned to President Valdas Adamkus hoping to convince him to temporarily suspend the then head of the VSD, Arvydas Pocius, whose decision not to provide information was assessed as a mockery of the Seimas. However, the president refused to meet with members of the Seimas. During the investigation, independent journalists published information regarding the suspects' alleged membership in the KGB and connections with the Russian state energy company Gazprom.[1]

In the committee's opinion, Pociūnas was removed from his previous duties within the VSD and assigned to Belarus in order to stop corruption investigations he was conducting in the transport and energy sectors. In addition, the committee stated that

certain signs identified during the parliamentary investigation allow to assume that some VSD investigations, actions of directors and officials in some cases may have been carried out or their results used for the benefit of certain political groups, in other cases - to influence these political groups or politicians themselves.[18][19]

The committee's opinion statement first coined the term ""statesman"" to refer to individuals allegedly involved, to Albinas Januška, without a negative connotation.[20]

The term ""statesmen"" was originally claimed by the accused politicians and civil servants themselves, to express their patriotism. Mečys Laurinkus commented on the existence of a group which ""formulated tasks"" for the State Security Department on 30 October 2007:

In many democratic states, there is a mechanism for forming tasks for the intelligence service and even reviewing them annually. These are special groups of politicians in the government or presidency. There is no such mechanism in Lithuania, the VSD works according to the Law on the Fundamentals of National Security, like a radar signaling an impending threat.
It is effective, but very expensive, and it also duplicates the work of other services. Several influential Lithuanian politicians, who are quite rightly called by the honorable name of ""statesmen"", took the initiative of formulating tasks. Unusual, new, but very necessary work has received distorted evaluations from both inside and outside the institution.[21]

This was taken by various politicians in the country to be a confirmation of the existence of the conspiracy, and Member of the Seimas Algimantas Matulevičius (Civic Democracy Party), in charge of a parliamentary investigation into VSD activity, described it as an unconstitutional act. Laurinkus later claimed that he does not remember the existence of such a scandal.[22]

Vytautas Pociūnas' widow, Liudvika Pociūnienė, requested the reopening of the terminated investigation in November 2006, claiming that it lacked detail and was not impartial. She was joined by Member of the Seimas Saulius Pečeliūnas (TS-LKD), who formed a nonpartisan civil society organization, Rally of Citizens (Lithuanian: Piliečių santalka), claiming to combat perceived cliques in the government and a ""nomenklatura more powerful than the law"".[23] Both complaints were dismissed by the General Prosecutor's Office in July 2007 on lacking grounds.[24]

Pociūnienė received support throughout the political spectrum. Vytautas Landsbergis, former leader of the Homeland Union, asserted that the conclusions of the prosecutor's office that Pociūnas died in an accident were ""worthless"", and the New Union (Social Liberals) lodged a demand that the General Prosecutor's Office should make the materials of the investigation file public.[25] On 17 August 2007, Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas announced the formation of a special work committee which would investigate the circumstances of Pociūnas' death, led by publicist Vytautas Ališauskas and staffed by Seimas and European Parliament members from several political parties.[26] New forensic and medical experts were hired after Pociūnas' widow and the press criticized the negligence of the forensic experts during the initial investigation.

The renewed investigation was slow and controversial. It was criticized by President Valdas Adamkus as a threat to the independence of the prosecution system.[27] The committee could only meet in 2008 due to conflicting schedules of the committee members (including two EP members, who worked in Brussels and could only participate on Fridays), and several of the committee's members resigned before the first meeting due to this inactivity.[28] Meanwhile, at the order of court, the General Prosecutor's Office renewed investigation into the case, which doubled the work of the committee. It was shut down in March 2008.[29] An independent investigation commission was organized by Sąjūdis in July 2008.[30] Vygaudas Ušackas alleged that asking for Landsbergis's support to be selected as Minister of Foreign Affairs in October 2008, he was requested to ""eliminate the Statesmen element administered by Albinas Januška"".[31]

On 24 February 2009, the case was closed again and the General Prosecutor's Office reaffirmed that Pociūnas' death was an accident. Liudvika Pociūnienė once again protested the verdict.[30] On 9 June 2009, the Vilnius District Court ordered the prosecutors to reopen the case a third time.[32] Under court order, the case was also reclassified as a murder case. After investigations into official documents, over 100 witnesses questioned and experiments organized in the Inturist hotel in Brest, the case was closed as an accident again on 1 February 2013.[33] Pociūnienė requested the case to be reopened again, but her request was dismissed.[34]

On 26 March 2008, an article titled ""Lithuania Has Been Taken Over by the Statesmen Clan?"" (Lithuanian: ""Lietuvą užvaldė „valstybininkų"" klanas?"") was published on the newspaper Lietuvos žinios. This article compiled a list of 43 civil servants, diplomats, advisors of then-president Valdas Adamkus, VSD employees, businessmen, political scientists, and members of the Seimas, who were allegedly members of a single hierarchical structured ""clan"" which seeks to take over the state.[5] According to editor-in-chief Valdas Vasiliauskas, it was published under a pseudonym to ""protect the author from possible retaliation"".[35]

In the same month, Mečys Laurinkus published an open letter for Vytautas Landsbergis, requesting him to use his authority to end ""the idiotic persecution of some civil servants that has been going on for almost two years now"". Laurinkus also asked the leadership of TS-LKD to mention a single crime committed by the alleged ""statesmen"".[36]

An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the formation of the Kirkilas Cabinet was proposed in the Seimas in 2008, but was voted down.[1] Discussion of the ""List of Statesmen"" and the high point of the conspiracy theory coincided with the 2008 Lithuanian parliamentary election, which was seen as an opportunity for ""De-Albinization"".[37] Several parties vowed to destroy the conspiracy's perceived power in their electoral campaigns. Opponents of the perceived ""statesmen"" described themselves as ""patriots"" (Lithuanian: ""pilietininkai"").[38] Both sides alleged that the other side was influenced or controlled by corporations and foreign interests - ""statesmen"" referred to the holding company MG Baltic and chemical company Achema, while ""patriots"" referred to Dujotekana and the business alliance ""VP Ten"", led by Nerijus Numavičius. Both sides accused the other of collusion with Russia.[39]

The election was won by the Homeland Union, which was joined by the Liberal and Centre Union, the National Resurrection Party and the Liberal Movement in a centre-right ""Coalition for Change"" (Lithuanian: Permainų koalicija), which formed the Kubilius Cabinet II.[40]

In November 2008, VSD director Povilas Malakauskas informed the newly appointed Homeland Union prime minister Andrius Kubilius of the existence of an alleged anti-state group called ""Hawks"" (Lithuanian: ""vanagai"").[41] ""Hawks"" were journalists and politicians affiliated with the political right who were actively involved in the alleged ""unmasking"" of ""statesmen"" activity. Valdas Vasiliauskas, journalist Tomas Čyvas, Darius Kuolys (later founder of the Lithuanian List), Audrius Bačiulis, Virgis Valentinavičius (advisor of Andrius Kubilius), Vladas Laučius (chief editor of news portal Alfa.lt, previously consultant for MG Baltic Media) and others were alleged as members of this counter-conspiracy.[42] Alleged members of this group claimed that this was a VSD attempt to control the media and influence politicians.[43]

Edvardas Čiuldė claimed that ""hawks"" represented the interests of large media companies and were financed by the alcohol producer Stumbras, owned by MG Baltic.[44]

Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of Lithuania from 2009 to 2019, won the 2009 Lithuanian presidential election with an anti-systemic platform and was supported by the Homeland Union.[45] After her inauguration, several state officials implicated in the conspiracy theory were removed from office. In August 2009, in a controversial decree, she fired deputy director of the VSD Darius Jurgelevičius, while Mečys Laurinkus was accused of politicking in diplomatic service and recalled from the Lithuanian embassy in Georgia in late 2009.[1] Valdas Vasiliauskas described it as ""a war between the President and the Statesmen"".[46]

Albinas Januška retired from politics in late 2008 to herd sheep in a farm near Zarasai, but continued to unofficially advise politicians on state affairs.[47]

By late 2010, the Homeland Union dropped their interest in the ""statesmen"" conspiracy theory and ceased investigations in government institutions such as the VSD,[48] although it was still maintained by independent ""hawk"" journalists,[43] the Civic Democracy Party[49] and the Way of Courage party.[50]

According to declassified VSD information, officials allegedly a part of the ""Statesmen"" group (including Albinas Januška and Raimondas Lopata) attempted to appoint Mindaugas Bastys as Minister of Agriculture in the Butkevičius Cabinet in 2012.[51]

In early 2023, the conspiracy theory was revived after the publication of the book ""The Whistleblower and the President"" (Lithuanian: Pranešėjas ir prezidentas) by Dovydas Pancerovas and Birutė Davidonytė, which described alleged business and VSD involvement in the Gitanas Nausėda campaign during the 2019 Lithuanian presidential election, including illegal collection of personal information. After the publication of the book, MPs of the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union alleged that the book was published to discredit the incumbent president and proposed an investigation into ""statesmen"" activity,[52] but the proposal did not find support even among the opposition.[2]

In January 2024, Gitanas Nausėda's chief advisor Frederikas Jansonas claimed that appointments to vacant ambassador positions are delayed due to ""statesmen"" sabotage, and alleged that the conspiracy group is allied with the Šimonytė Cabinet. He identified members of the government, such as Žygimantas Pavilionis, as individuals listed in the 2008 ""List of the Statesmen"".[53] Albinas Januška dismissed the allegations.[54]

Proponents of the conspiracy theory generally refer to individuals named in the ""List of the Statesmen"" (Lithuanian: ""valstybininkų"" sąrašas), which lists the alleged deep state's members and supporters.[55] The list was originally published by the newspaper Lietuvos žinios on 26 March 2008:[5]

The newspaper also claimed that other, unmentioned figures are affiliated with the conspiracy within political parties, in the legal system and in business.[5]

The Statesmen conspiracy theory was pronounced during the 2008 Lithuanian parliamentary election. In their 2008 election programs, the Civic Democracy Party vowed to ""destroy the ""statesmen clan"""", and Order and Justice claimed that they ""seek power in order to restore the state to the people, which they were robbed by the ""statesmen"" clan"".[56] The conspiracy was also frequently referred to by politicians of the Homeland Union, such as Rasa Juknevičienė, as well as President Dalia Grybauskaitė, who connected it with Russian influence in the Lithuanian government.[10]

During Kubilius Cabinet II, the death of Vytautas Pociūnas was brought up by Conservative politicians, such as Jurgis Razma, as waving the bloody shirt to support reforms to the State Security Department and the dissolution of the national energy company LEO LT.[57]

The Statesmen conspiracy theory emerged at a similar time as the Case of Drąsius Kedys, another controversial legal case which led to public protest against perceived corruption and ""clans"" in the state apparatus. According to controversial journalist and TV presenter Rūta Janutienė, in both cases, ""the victim is turned into the culprit of the accident, labels of alcoholics and drug addicts are attached to the deceased"".[58] Tomas Čyvas claimed that state security services connected to the conspiracy were responsible for separating Drąsius Kedys and his daughter.[41] Similarly, the investigation into the unexplained assassination of VSD officer Juras Abromavičius took place in 2007, and some journalists and conspiracy theorists stated that they were committed by the same ""mafia clan"".[59]

Vytautas Pociūnas' widow, Liudvika Pociūnienė, became a member of TS-LKD and was elected as a Member of the Seimas in the 2020 Lithuanian parliamentary election.[60]

A 2006 November file on the resignation of Albinas Januška by the United States embassy in Lithuania was leaked from a document cache by WikiLeaks. In it, US officials express their surprise at Januška's resignation, mention his influence in the Kirkilas Cabinet and state theories about his resignation by questioned Lithuanian officials, including possible Russian involvement. According to the document,

Whenever a prominent official in Lithuania becomes the victim of a scandal, it is usual to blame Russia. We may never know why this mysterious official resigned. What still confuses us is that A. Januska resigned because of such hard-to-prove and unfounded accusations. For all we know, he could have overcome this situation if he had wanted to. However, we believe that this Svengali of Lithuania will remain active and influential in the circles of Lithuanian domestic and foreign politics in the future.[61]

A previously unnamed street in the Pilaitė district in Vilnius was named Vytautas Pociūnas Street in 2016.[62]

Švyturys Camp,"Švyturys Camp (Švyturio stovykla) is an educational and cultural camp organized by Lithuanian National Guard, a non-profit organisation, for Lithuanian-American youth. Held for the first time in 2024, the camp brought together participants aged 12 to 17 from U.S. states to be taught survival skills, basic first aid, and Lithuanian history.[1][2][3] Participant activities include Lithuanian flag-raising ceremonies, singing the national anthem of Lithuania, and lectures on Lithuanian history and culture.[2][3][4][5]

The camp aims to expand cultural education and preserve identity within the Lithuanian diaspora. Many second and third-generation Lithuanian Americans struggle to maintain connections with their heritage, and this camp offers a way to reinvigorate that relationship through immersive experiences.[6][7]

In 2024, Švyturys Camp was nominated for an award for initiatives promoting Lithuanian statehood and civic engagement.[4]

Augustinas Janulaitis,"Augustinas Janulaitis (1878–1950) was a Lithuanian attorney, judge, and university professor who specialized in the legal history of Lithuania.

Janulatis studied law at the University of Moscow but was expelled for participating in the 1899 Russian student strike. He was active in Lithuanian public life. He smuggled and distributed prohibited Lithuanian press and performed in America in the Bathhouse, the first Lithuanian play staged in Palanga. For such activities, he was arrested by the Tsarist police but escaped to East Prussia in 1902 and later Switzerland. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in 1901 and edited its newspaper Darbininkų balsas. He returned to Lithuania in 1906 and managed to complete his law degree at the University of Moscow in 1907. He then worked as an attorney and was active in public life in Vilnius.

At the start of the Lithuanian–Soviet War in December 1918, he briefly served as the acting Minister of Foreign Affairs. He then moved to Kaunas where he was appointed as a judge to the Supreme Tribunal of Lithuania. In 1919–1920, Janulaitis helped organizing the Higher Courses which were reorganized into the University of Lithuania in 1922. He taught mainly the legal history of Lithuania and became dean of the Faculty of Law in 1935. He was the founder and long-term chairman of the Lithuanian Historical Society. Janulaitis was a prolific author and published more than 660 books, articles, and other works.

He was transferred to Vilnius University in January 1940. He was one of the first academic members admitted to the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in 1941. However, the Soviets criticized him for his apolitical stance and for publishing an anti-communist book in 1925. Reportedly, he was not arrested because he was terminally ill with cancer. He died in May 1950.

Augustinas Janulaitis was born on 31 March [O.S. 19 March] 1878 in Malavėnai [lt] near Šiauliai, then part of the Russian Empire.[1] The family had 13 children, nine of whom reached adulthood and five completed university education.[2] He was the youngest son.[3] His siblings included Catholic priest Pranciškus Janulaitis [lt], ophthalmologist Veronika Alseikienė, and dentist Julija Biliūnienė.[4]

In 1886, he enrolled at the Šiauliai Gymnasium. As a high school student, he collected 144 Lithuanian folk songs, 73 of which were published in the journal of the Lithuanian Literary Society in 1898–1899.[5] He started compiling a collection of Lithuanian war songs, but it was not published.[6] He was expelled from the gymnasium in 1893 because he had violated the Lithuanian press ban – he was found in the possession of Lithuanian-language publications. He then moved to Riga and graduated from the Nicholas I Gymnasium in Riga [lv] in 1896. He studied law at the University of Moscow until 1899 when he was expelled for participating in the Russian student strike.[1]

As a student, Janulaitis actively participated in the Lithuanian National Revival. He participated in a campaign organized by Lithuanian periodicals Varpas and Ūkininkas to get the press ban lifted.[1] Janulaitis distributed proclamations and collected signatures for petitions to the Tsar. He also smuggled and distributed Lithuanian publications in and near Šiauliai.[1] Vaclovas Biržiška, at the time a student at the Šiauliai Gymnasium, later credited Janulaitis as the person who introduced him to Lithuanian publications.[7] Janulaitis' articles were printed in Varpas, Ūkininkas, Vienybė lietuvninkų. His associates included Povilas Višinskis, Petras Avižonis, Jonas Biliūnas.[3]

In August 1899, he played the role of Antanas in America in the Bathhouse in Palanga – the first Lithuanian-language theater performance in present-day Lithuania. He reprised the role when the play was staged again in Liepāja in January 1900.[8] He also staged a Lithuanian play based on Marriage by Nikolai Gogol in Šiauliai.[1] Such activities attracted attention from the Tsarist police which investigated Liudas Vaineikis. Janulaitis was arrested in 1900 when the police found an anti-Tsarist brochure and a list of Lithuanian books in his apartment.[1] He spent about 6.5 months in prisons in Liepāja and Aizpute. He was released on a 300 ruble bail.[8] In February 1902, he was sentenced to three years of exile to Siberia, but he managed to escape to East Prussia, then to Scotland and Switzerland where he continued to study law at the University of Bern until 1905.[8]

He joined the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in 1901 and was elected to its Central Committee (he left the party in 1922).[8] From May 1902 to the end of 1905, Janulaitis edited Darbininkų balsas, the newspaper of the Social Democratic Party printed by Martynas Jankus.[9] Janulaitis became the first to translate into Lithuanian The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (published by Jankus in 1904).[10] Later, in 1912, he also translated and published Socialism: Utopian and Scientific by Engels. These two translations were the first translations of classical communist literature into Lithuanian.[11] In 1900–1905, Janulaitis published several political brochures mainly based on works by Polish authors. Written for the general public, these publications reflected socialist and nationalist ideas.[12]

In 1906, Janulaitis returned to Lithuania with a fake passport.[1] He was caught at the border and tried in Vilnius for importing prohibited publications from Germany. He was sentenced to ten months in prison.[1] He served the time in Lukiškės Prison. He then managed to get readmitted to the University of Moscow and complete his law degree in 1907.[8] In 1907–1916 and 1918–1919, Janulaitis lives in Vilnius and practiced as an attorney. He worked as an assistant attorney to Jonas Vileišis and Tadeusz Wróblewski before obtaining the full attorney license in 1912.[1]

Janulaitis continued to be active in Lithuanian cultural life. Together with Mykolas Biržiška, he briefly edited Žarija [lt], a periodical of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. He also published numerous articles in Vilniaus žinios, Lietuvos žinios, Visuomenė. He collected and prepared for publication works of his brother-in-law Jonas Biliūnas.[1] He joined the Lithuanian Scientific Society in 1908 and was elected to its board in 1914–1918.[13] He presented ten research papers at the society, second only to its founder Jonas Basanavičius who presented 15.[14] In 1915, Janulaitis was elected to a commission of the Scientific Society tasked with the publication of Lithuanian textbooks.[15] He was also a member of the Lithuanian Literary Society.[16]

When Germany occupied Vilnius during World War I, Janulaitis joined the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers.[17] In March 1916, he became a member of the commission that organized a census in Vilnius to determine the city's ethnic composition.[18] He was associated with a small Lithuanian political club which debated Lithuania's post-war future.[19] For this involvement,[20] he was arrested in November 1916.[21] The location of his imprisonment is variously given as either a prisoner camp in Czersk (East Prussia) or a concentration camp in Vokė (Lithuania).[8] During this time, he translated Outline of Sociology by Ludwig Gumplowicz which was published in 1929.[22] He was released in late 1917 and returned to Vilnius in early 1918.[1] He worked as editorial staff of Darbo balsas [lt][21] and taught at the Lithuanian Gymnasium in Vilnius.[23]

At the start of the Lithuanian–Soviet War in December 1918, Lithuanian Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Augustinas Voldemaras departed for Germany to ask for financial assistance. Janulaitis was the administrator of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, in Voldemaras' absence, became the acting minister.[8] However, his government career lasted only about three weeks as the government evacuated to Kaunas while Janulaitis remained in Vilnius.[24]

In April 1918, a group of jurists agreed to assist the Council of Lithuania.[1] In May 1918, Janulaitis, as a member of this commission, presented the council with a historical overview of courts in Lithuania and particularly of the medieval Lithuanian Tribunal.[25] This overview was used by the Lithuanian government to establish a new court system that replaced the Russian system that existed since the judicial reform of Alexander II in 1864.[25] Janulaitis published the medieval law on the tribunal in 1927.[26]

Janulaitis was appointed as chairman of the Vilnius District Court, but could not start the work due to the Lithuanian–Soviet War.[27] He was briefly arrested by the authorities of the newly proclaimed Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in January 1919.[28] He moved to Kaunas and was appointed as a judge to the Supreme Tribunal of Lithuania on 26 May 1919. He was the second judge to join the court and was its acting chairman until Antanas Kriščiukaitis arrived to Kaunas in June 1919.[27][29] In December 1919, Janulaitis became a member of the commission tasked with drafting the Constitution of Lithuania which was adopted in 1922.[30]

He worked at the tribunal until 6 May 1925 when he was reassigned as chairman of the District Court of Panevėžys.[1] This was done by Prime Minister Antanas Tumėnas without the consent of Janulaitis and it caused a political scandal. Opponents of Tumėnas accused him of intervening in court affairs and undermining tribunal's independence.[31] Janulaitis was returned to the Supreme Tribunal on 24 September 1926.[1]

In 1933–1935, Janulaitis worked as an attorney. He prepared cassation cases and often represented the Ministry of Agriculture.[1] He was dismissed as an attorney in September 1935. He briefly resumed attorney work in 1944.[1]

In 1919–1920, Janulaitis was a member of the commission tasked with organizing the Higher Courses. Once the courses were established, Janulaitis headed their legal section and taught legal history.[32] When the courses were reorganized into the University of Lithuania in 1922, he became chair of the Department of the Legal History of Lithuania at the new university.[24] He taught primarily the legal history of Lithuania (which was a mandatory class for first-year law students), but also taught selected topics from the history of Lithuania (e.g. history of serfdom, Uprising of 1831).[33] His legal history lectures were not published as a textbook, therefore students printed some lectures notes in 1932–1933.[34]

He was recognized as a tenured professor in 1924 and received doctorate in law in 1932. He became dean of the Faculty of Law in 1935.[24] He was offered the position back in 1922, but refused because at the time he did not have an advanced degree and worked as a judge.[35] He also lectured at the Dotnuva Agricultural Academy and Higher Officers' Courses.[24] He edited university's academic law journals Teisės mokslų bibliotekos darbai (27 volumes in 1924–1939), Teisės fakulteto darbai (volumes 2–10 in 1928–1939), and Teisės ir ekonomijos studijos (2 volumes in 1936–1938).[36] In 1921, he was elected to the editorial board of historical journal Mūsų senovė.[37]

In 1922–1925, Janulaitis was chairman of the State Archaeological Commission.[1] He resigned from the commission in protest of lack of funding.[38] In May 1929, the founding meeting of the Lithuanian Historical Society was held in Janulaitis apartment.[39] He became society's long-term chairman and editor of its journal Praeitis (two volumes in 1930 and 1933). The society became inactive after the history section was established at the Institute for Lithuanian Studies.[39] Janulaitis was also chairman of the history section at the Military Science Society[40] as well as a board member of the Lithuanian Society of Lawyers [lt].[41] He was a member of the Masonic lodge established by Michał Pius Römer in Kaunas in 1920.[42] Janulaitis was a member of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union and was elected to its court of honor in 1936–1937 and 1938–1940.[43]

To further his historical research, Janulaitis collected old historical documents.[21] He conducted his research at several archives, including in Berlin (1921–1922), Polish Library in Paris[44] (1924), Königsberg (1935).[45] He also participated in various conferences, including the congress of Baltic attorneys in Kaunas in 1931,[46] the conference of Baltic historians in Riga in 1937 and the 8th International Congress of Historical Sciences in Zürich in 1938.[45]

When Lithuania gained Vilnius, he was transferred to Vilnius University in January 1940.[47] After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, he signed a public statement of support for the Union of the Working People of Lithuania in the rigged elections to the People's Seimas in July 1940.[48] Despite this, the new Soviet regime demoted Janulaitis (Vaclovas Biržiška replaced him as the dean of the Law Faculty).[49] Janulaitis and twelve others became the first members of the newly established Lithuanian Academy of Sciences in April 1941.[50]

In 1945, Janulaitis became the dean of the History Philology Faculty of Vilnius University[51] but was dismissed in July 1946.[52] The Soviets criticized Janulaitis for ""twisting the history of Lithuania"" and ""inciting prejudice among the students against the Russian nation.""[53] In 1947, Antanas Sniečkus, the First Secretary of the Lithuanian Communist Party, accused Janulaitis of keeping an apolitical stance and avoiding expressing opinions on the current political situation. Sniečkus indicated that Janulaitis had expressed his political opinions in the past and specifically pointed out to anti-communist Lietuva ir šiuolaikinė Rusija (Lithuania and Modern Russia) published in 1925.[54] Janulaitis published other works critical of Russia and communism. For example, in 1946–1947, he wrote a manuscript which criticized efforts of Russian historians to portray the Lithuanians as a Russian people.[55] During the Soviet period, Janulaitis published just one short article about the historian Teodor Narbutt,[51] even though he continued working on studies of the legal history of Lithuania.[56]

According to his niece Meilė Lukšienė, Soviet authorities made a decision to arrest Janulaitis in early 1950. But at the time he was already terminally ill with cancer and the arrest was avoided.[57] Janulaitis died on 22 May 1950 in Kaunas and was buried in the Petrašiūnai Cemetery.[3] The funeral was an official event due to the efforts of Juozas Bulavas.[57]

Janulaitis was a prolific author. He published some 70 brochures and books.[1] His bibliography published in 1972 had 665 entries.[58] Many other studies remained in unpublished manuscripts.[59] He published studies on Lithuanian history, politics, and culture.[1] He published 45 biographies about 30 people of the 19th and 20th centuries.[60] as well as contributed encyclopedic articles to Lietuviškoji enciklopedija.[61] He was the first to write about the legal history of Lithuania in Lithuanian.[62] He critically evaluated Polish historiography which focused on the role of szlachta (nobles) and instead emphasized the role of peasants and the common folk.[63] 
Unlike other Lithuanian historians who tried to ""cleanse"" the history of Lithuania from foreign influences, Janulaitis was genuinely interested in the history of the Lithuanian Jews and considered it an integral part of the history of Lithuania.[64][65]

Janulaitis was a strong adherent to the historical method based on the careful and critical analysis of primary sources. The method was propagated by Charles Seignobos and Charles-Victor Langlois.[66] Janulaitis often selected a narrow topic and attempted to review and utilize all available primary and secondary sources.[67] The adoption of this rigorous method led Janulaitis to conflicts with romantic historians, most notably with Jonas Basanavičius. Janulaitis published a brochure criticizing Basanavičius, Jonas Šliūpas, Vincas Pietaris and their theories about the origins of the Lithuanian nation (first edition in 1903, second in 1907).[68] Thus he became the first to criticize romantic theories on the ethnogenesis of Lithuanians.[69]

Janulaitis started publishing historical articles in 1910.[70] His first articles concerned the struggles of Lithuanian peasants during the Uprising of 1831 and Šiauliai Revolt [lt] in 1769. These articles are significant since Janulaitis used archival documents of the Šiauliai Economy [lt] that were lost during World War I.[70] These studies were also the first studies by a Lithuanian historian primarily based on archival sources.[71]

He also published works of fiction – he prepared works of Jonas Biliūnas for publication, translated works of Heinrich Heine and Fyodor Dostoevsky.[24] In an attempt to provide Lithuanian theater with material, he translated a number of plays by Herman Heijermans, Nikolai Gogol, Arne Garborg, Ludwig Thoma, Henrik Ibsen, Adolf Nowaczyński [pl], Friedrich Schiller, but published only three plays by Ibsen and one by Nowaczyński.[63]

Majors publications of Janulaitis include:[36]

Janulaitis amassed a large personal library, of which 13,685 titles (14,763 items) were donated to the present-day Kaunas County Public Library [lt] in 1965.[72] More than 90% of the collection are publications in Russian, German, and Polish, with Lithuanian publications making up less than 5%. Other works are in French, Latin, English, etc.[72] Some of the works are handwritten copies of published texts.[73] About a quarter of the collection consists of articles from various periodicals. They are frequently compiled into books based on topic or author. There are 1,215 such compilations in Russian.[74] 353 items in the collection are theses, vast majority in German. The oldest thesis is by Christoph Hartknoch from 1674.[75] Overall, the oldest publication is a Latin collection of letters and works by Pope Pius II published in 1518.[76] In total, 265 books in the collection were published before 1850.[77]

Janulaitis acquired the publications by various means. Some were gifted by their authors (at least 107 books),[78] others were acquired via acquaintances. For example, books were sent by Balys Sruoga from Russia and by Petras Klimas from France.[79] Janulaitis purchased publications from numerous bookstores – known bookstores number 68 in 28 cities in five countries.[78] His surviving correspondence shows that he often purchased on account and was not timely settling it.[80] He also acquired books from other private collections and libraries.[78]

In 1928, Janulaitis was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas (4th degree).[45]

In 1940, a monument to Lithuanian book smugglers was built in the garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum which listed a hundred names of prominent book smugglers, including Janulaitis. The monument was demolished by Soviet authorities in 1950 and rebuilt in 1997.[1]

In 1967, his widow Elena Jurašaitytė donated his archives to the Wroblewski Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.[51] They were organized and described by his niece Meilė Lukšienė (work completed in 1985). The archive contains 3,958 documents.[51] The archive contains materials from Janulaitis' life, his manuscripts of published and unpublished studies, and a collection of various 16th–20th century documents.[81]

In 1978, a memorial plaque was affixed the house in Kaunas where Janulaitis lived.[82] The building was built by Janulaitis in 1932 according to the plans by modernist architect Arnas Funkas [lt]. It was added to the Registry of Cultural Heritage in 2004.[83]

In 1978, the Lithuanian Institute of History organized a conference on the occasion of the 100th birth anniversary of Janualaitis.[84] In 2018, the Wroblewski Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences held a month-long exhibition about Janulaitis' life and work on the occasion of his 140th anniversary.[21]

In 2016, a street in Šilainiai (neighborhood of Kaunas) was named after Janulaitis.[82]

Janulaitis married Elena Jurašaitytė (1893–1982),[85] daughter of photographer Aleksandras Jurašaitis [lt].[3] Her sister Aleksandra was the wife of Jonas Vailokaitis, banker and signatory of the Act of Independence of Lithuania. Jurašaitytė and Janulaitis had one son Kęstutis (born 1934).[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustinas_Janulaitis
Saulė,"Saulė (Lithuanian: Saulė, Latvian: Saule) is a solar goddess, the common Baltic solar deity in the Lithuanian and Latvian mythologies. The noun Saulė/Saule in the Lithuanian and Latvian languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Baltic name *Sauliā > *Saulē.[1]

Saulė is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of the sun itself, responsible for all life on Earth. She is the patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. The Lithuanian and Latvian words for ""the world"" (pasaulis and pasaule) are translated as ""[a place] under the Sun"".

Saulė is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to the Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a smith named Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky.[2] Missionary Jerome of Prague (ca. 1369–1440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about the kidnapped Saulė. She was held in a tower by a powerful king and rescued by the zodiac (Signa Zodiaci) using a giant sledgehammer. Jerome swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals.[3]

Saulė and Mėnuo/Mēness (the Moon) were wife and husband. Mėnuo fell in love with Aušrinė (the morning star or Venus). For his infidelity, Perkūnas (thunder god) punished Mėnuo. There are different accounts of the punishment. One version has it that Mėnuo was cut into two pieces, but he did not learn from his mistakes and thus the punishment is repeated every month. Another version claims that Mėnuo and Saulė divorced, but both wanted to see their daughter Žemyna (earth).[4] That is why the Sun shines during the day, while the Moon visits at night. A third version claims that the face of Mėnuo was disfigured by either Dievas (the supreme god) or Saulė.[5]

In other myths, Aušrinė is depicted as a daughter and servant of Saulė. Aušrinė lights the fire for Saulė and makes her ready for another day's journey across the sky. Vakarinė (the evening star) makes the bed for Saulė in the evening. In the Lithuanian mythology, Saulė was mother of other planets: Indraja (Jupiter), Sėlija (Saturn), Žiezdrė (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury).[5]

Saulė's feast was celebrated during the summer solstice. Lithuanian Rasos (turned into Saint Jonas' Festival by Christianity) and Latvian Līgo (turned into Jāņi) involve making wreaths, looking for the magical fern flower, burning bonfires, dancing around and leaping over the fire, and greeting the Sun when it rises at around 4 am next morning.[6] It is the most joyous traditional holiday. The winter solstice is celebrated as the return of Saulė. Christianity absorbed Lithuanian Kūčios and Latvian Ziemassvētki into Christmas. Other celebrations took place around the equinoxes.[5]

In Latvian folk songs, Saule and her daughter(s) are dressed of shawls woven with gold thread and Saule wears shoes of gold.[7] She is also depicted in a silver, gold or silk costume and wearing a sparkling crown.[8]

She is sometimes portrayed as waking up ""red"" (sārta) or ""in a red tree"" during the morning.[9] Saule is also said to own golden tools and garments: slippers, scarf, belt, and a golden boat she uses as her means of transportation.[10] Other accounts ascribe her golden rings, golden ribbons, golden tassels, and even a golden crown.[11]

Saule is also described as being dressed in clothes woven with ""threads of red, gold, silver and white"".[12] In the Lithuanian tradition, the sun is also described as a ""golden wheel"" or a ""golden circle"" that rolls down the mountain at sunset.[13] Also in Latvian riddles and songs, Saule is associated with the color red as if to indicate the ""fiery aspect"" of the sun: the setting and the rising sun are equated with a rose wreath and a rose in bloom due to their circular shapes.[14][11][15][a]

Saulė is portrayed dancing in her gilded shoes on a silver hill and her fellow Baltic goddess Aušrinė is said to dance on a stone for the people on the first day of summer.[17][18] In Lithuania, the Sun (identified as female) rides a car towards her husband, the Moon, ""dancing and emitting fiery sparks"" on the way.[19]

In a myth from Lithuania, a man named Joseph becomes fascinated with Aušrinė appearing in the sky and goes on a quest to find the ""second sun"", who is actually a maiden that lives on an island in the sea and has the same hair like the Sun.[17] In the Baltic folklore, Saulė is said to live in a silver gated castle at the end of the sea,[20] located somewhere in the east,[21] or to go to an island in the middle of the sea for her nocturnal rest.[22] In folksongs, Saule sinks into the bottom of a lake to sleep at night, in a silver cradle ""in the white seafoam"".[23][b]

The Sun, which has a feminine gender in Baltic languages, is described as an anthromorphized being that rides across the celestial abode in a vehicle, like a carriage or a chariot, which is described as saulės ratai in Lithuanian and saules rati in Latvian.[25]

Saulė also drives a carriage with copper wheels,[26] a ""gleaming copper chariot""[27] or a golden chariot[28] pulled by untiring horses or a ""pretty little sleigh"" (kamaņiņa) made of fish-bones.[29][30] Saulė is also described as driving her shining car on the way to her husband, the Moon.[19] In other accounts, she is said to sail the seas on a silver[31] or a golden boat,[27] which, according to legend, is what her chariot transforms into for her night travels.[21][32] In a Latvian folksong, Saule hangs her sparkling crown on a tree in the evening and enters a golden boat to sail away.[8]

The Sun is associated with horses in Baltic mythology: Lithuanian riddles describe the Sun as a ball with a hundred horses (""šimtas arklių nepavež"") - an image repeated in Latvian songs (""Simts kumeliņu"").[33]

Saulė's horses are also mentioned in several pieces of Baltic folklore. Her horses are said to be of white color;[21] in other accounts they amount to three steeds of golden, silver and diamond colors.[19] In Latvian dainas (folk songs), her horses are described as yellow,[34] of a golden or a fiery color.[32] The sun's steeds are also portrayed as having hooves and bridles of gold in the dainas, and as golden beings themselves or of a bay colour, ""reflect[ing] the hues of the bright or the twilight sky"".[35] When she begins her nocturnal journey through the World Sea, her chariot changes into a boat and ""the Sun swims her horses"",[31] which signifies that ""she stops to wash her horses in the sea"".[36]

Scholarship points that the expressions geltoni žirgeliai or dzelteni kumeliņi ('golden' or 'yellow horses'), which appear in Latvian dainas, seem to be a recurrent poetic motif.[11] According to Nijole Laurinkiene, the expression could refer to a golden or fiery character to the animals.[37]

According to studies by professor Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga and ethnologue Nijolė Laurinkienė [lt], Saule is also depicted in folksongs as a ""mother"" (Lithuanian motinėlė, Latvian māmuliņa)[32] who comforts orphans, which is the reason why the sun takes time to rise.[38] In other folksongs, the personified female Sun is also associated with the color ""white"" (Latv balt-), such as the imagery of a white shirt, the expression ""mīļā, balte"" (""Sun, dear, white""), and the description of the trajectory of the sun (red as it rises, white as it journeys on its way).[39]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saulė

Union of Grodno (1432),"The Union of Grodno was a series of acts of the Polish–Lithuanian union between Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first acts were signed in 1432 during the Lithuanian Civil War of 1432–1438. The acts confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401). The Union established Sigismund Kęstutaitis as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and re-established Władysław II Jagiełło's seniority and dynastic interest in Lithuania.

After death of Vytautas in 1430, the Lithuanian nobles unilaterally selected Švitrigaila as the new Grand Duke. This violated the terms of the Union of Horodło of 1413, where Lithuanians promised not to elect a new Grand Duke without an approval from Poland.[1] The Polish nobles were outraged and demanded that Švitrigaila acknowledged fealty to his brother Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland. Švitrigaila refused and the conflict grew into a civil war.[1] In September 1431, Poland and Lithuania signed a two-year truce; however, on 31 August 1432, a group of nobles deposed Švitrigaila in support of Sigismund Kęstutaitis, brother of Vytautas.[2] Sigismund resumed policy of union with Poland. A Polish delegation, sent to Lithuania by Władysław II Jagiełło and led by Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Bishop of  Kraków,[3] pronounced Sigismund as the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life on 30 September 1432.[4] Sigismund swore loyalty to Poland in an act, signed in Grodno (Hrodna) on 25 October 1432. Władysław II Jagiełło confirmed both acts on 3 January 1433.[4] Sigismund had to reconfirm his loyalty to these provisions on 20 January 1433, 27 February 1434, 6 December 1437 and 31 October 1439.[5] Collectively all these acts are known as the Union of Grodno.[4]

The Union established a clear lord–vassal relationship between Władysław II Jagiełło (styled dominus nostra and frater seniorus) and Sigismund (styled supremus princeps ad tempora vitae).[5] The act in essence confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and granted Sigismund the same rights as Vytautas enjoyed during his reign.[2] After Sigismund's death, Lithuania was to return to the King of Poland; thus the Union of Grodno abandoned provisions of the Union of Horodło (1413), which envisioned that the Lithuanian nobility would elect their new Grand Duke with consent of the Polish nobles.[5] Sigismund promised not to seek the Lithuanian crown and his son Michael Žygimantaitis had no dynastic rights to the throne of Lithuania. Thus Jagiełło's dynastic interest in Lithuania was re-established, which is explained by the fact that in 1413 he had no children, while in 1432 he had two sons (Władysław III and Casimir IV).[5] Sigismund also made territorial concessions to Poland, which received contested Podolia and part of Volhynia (except for Lutsk and Volodymyr-Volynskyi). After Sigismund's death entire Volhynia was to unconditionally pass to Poland.[5]

In 1435 Sigismund won the decisive Battle of Wiłkomierz thus ending the Lithuanian Civil War of 1431–1435. He established himself in Lithuania and began distancing from pro-Polish policies. Sigismund took advantage of dynastic struggle between the Jagiellons and the Habsburg dynasty over the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1437–1438 and attempted to form an anti-Polish coalition with the Teutonic Knights.[5] The plan failed and Sigismund was forced to re-confirm the Union of Grodno in 1437 and 1439. Despite the declarations, after Sigismund's murder in 1440, the Lithuanians unilaterally elected Casimir IV Jagiellon as their Grand Duke. The union between Poland and Lithuania was broken until 1447, when Casimir also became King of Poland.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Grodno_(1432)
Lithuanian Land Forces,"The Lithuanian Land Forces (LLF) form the backbone of the Lithuanian Armed Forces and are capable of acting as an integral part of NATO forces. Lithuanian Land Forces consist of a single recently formed 1st Army Division, the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces, and supporting units, together comprising over 22,000 soldiers.

The main element of the Land Forces is the 1st Army Division, comprising the Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade, The ""Žemaitija"" (Griffin) infantry brigade, and the ""Aukštaitija"" infantry brigade.

The Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade is the main element of the Division and is formed around three mechanized infantry battalions and an artillery battalion, all named after Lithuanian grand dukes as the tradition of the Lithuanian Armed Forces goes.

The ""Žemaitija"" (Griffin) brigade was activated on 1 January 2016.[2] It is composed of three motorised infantry battalions and one artillery battalion; one of these is tasked to support operations both domestically and overseas; one is tasked primarily with the defence of territorial Lithuania.

The Brigade ""Aukštaitija"" is a reserve brigade, which was activated on 23 March 2017. In peacetime the brigade's headquarter staff works at the Lithuanian Armed Forces Training and Doctrine Command. The brigade's three maneuver battalions are made up of reservists, while the three battalion's headquarters personnel works in peacetime at the Division General Stasys Raštikis Lithuanian Armed Forces School, Great Lithuanian Hetman Jonušas Radvila Training Regiment, and General Adolfas Ramanauskas Combat Training Center. The brigade's reconnaissance company is composed of conscripts, while the brigade's headquarters, signal and logistic units are composed of professional soldiers. When activated the brigade consists of around 4,500 troops.

Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion is responsible for mine clearance, the construction of pontoon bridges, unexploded ordnance detonation tasks, underwater engineering, and participation in search and rescue operations. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Platoon is ready to participate in international operations. Starting in 2008, the Lithuanian Armed Forces launched a 10-year-long project continuing mine cleaning on Lithuanian territory of explosives left after the First and Second World War, and in former Soviet military bases.

As an integral part of the Land Forces, the National Defence Volunteers have been developing since the beginning of the national movement for independence. The volunteers act smoothly together with the Allies during military operations and have been assigned new missions: to augment the regular forces, to deploy individual units and specific capabilities for international operations, to assist host nation support and to support the civilian authorities.

With the reintroduction of conscription in 2015 the Lithuanian Land Force began an expansion of its main combat formations. As of January 2025 the land forces consist of the following units:

In reforming the Armed Forces, most of the available attention and financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces. Lithuania has been modernizing its armed forces since 1990s and by now nearly all equipment is compatible with the NATO standards. The current efforts focus on increasing the firepower, acquiring new equipment and armaments, enhancing their operational effectiveness and combat training. The standard service assault rifle of the Lithuanian Armed Forces is the Heckler & Koch G36 and the standard pistol is the Glock 17. The Lithuanian Land Forces are also equipped with machine guns, including the GPMG MG-3, the FN MAG, and the 12.7mm (.50 cal.) M2 Browning machine gun. They also employ the AT-4 anti-tank rockets and Carl Gustav anti-tank recoilless rifles, HK GMG high-velocity grenade launchers, and low-velocity AG-36 under-the-barrel grenade launchers, in addition to light and heavy mortars. The army also uses high-technology Lithuanian-made tactical automated commanding and controlling informational systems (TAVVIS).

Conscription in Lithuania lasts 9 months. Every year a random list of 18-23-year-old men are called up to fill the 3,500 draftee requirement, however men and women up to 38 years old can apply voluntarily. In practice, only a small fraction of the conscripts need to be drafted, as the vast majority apply and serve voluntarily.[7] After completing the 9 months service, conscripts are added to the active military reserve, where they remain for 10 years and are periodically called up to refresh their skills.[8]

Conscription halted in Lithuanian in 2008, as the military focused on developing the professional armed forces, and the relative geopolitical stability coupled with economic crisis didn't justify the increased spending.[9]

Conscription was eventually reintroduced in 2015, this decision was determined by two main reasons: changed geopolitical situation and insufficient manning of the units of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The first draft included 3,000 people, with plans to raise it to 3,500 the following year.[10]

The deteriorating geopolitical state in 2022 reignited the debate over importance of conscription, and as of 2025 there are numerous reforms planned with the eventual goal of universal mandatory conscription. A new law will take effect starting 2026 that will, among other things, raise the quantity of enlisted conscripts from 3,500 to 4,000, change the draft pool to include all high-school graduates from 18 to 22 years old, and offer more alternative forms of service.[11]

Treaty of Khotyn,"Treaty of Khotyn (Chocim/Hotin), signed on 9 October 1621 in the aftermath of the Battle of Khotyn, ended the Polish–Ottoman War.[1][2] With this peace treaty, the Khotyn fortress was given to Moldavia as an Ottoman vassal and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth agreed to stop its interference in Moldavia. Both sides claimed victory, as the Commonwealth saw the battle of Khotyn as successfully stopping the Ottoman Empire's invasion of its mainland.

The Treaty was rather favorable to the Commonwealth, but the Ottoman Emperor also gained what it wanted. There were no territorial changes; the Commonwealth-Ottoman border was confirmed to be the Dniester river, and the Commonwealth recognized Ottoman control over Moldavia. In the Commonwealth, and among the Ukrainian Cossacks, stopping of the huge Ottoman army was seen as a great victory.

The treaty for the most part repeated the earlier agreement – Treaty of Busza (also known as Treaty of Jaruga) (1617), negotiated by Stanisław Żółkiewski and Iskender Pasha. That 1617 treaty stated that Poland would not meddle in the internal affairs of Ottoman vassals in Transylvania, Moldavia and Wallachia, the Commonwealth was to prevent Cossacks from raiding lands in the Ottoman Empire, while ceding Khotyn. In return, the Ottoman Empire promised to stop Tatar raids.

The Ottomans, on the other hand, even though they gained Commonwealth recognition of their control over Moldavia, were in much worse shape internally. Notably, Chodkiewicz wasn't the only one to die as a result of that battle: Sultan Osman himself paid the highest price for the failure of his plans. The Khotyn outcome, and the Ottoman failure to crush the outnumbered Commonwealth army, led Osman to put the blame on the janissaries. Osman wanted to modernize the army, which he blamed for the defeat; his plans for modernization were, however, opposed by the traditional-minded janissaries, culminating in the rebellion of janissaries in 1622, in which Osman II was assassinated.

The Commonwealth-Ottoman border would be fairly quiet until the Polish-Ottoman War (1633-1634).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Khotyn
Alfredas Bumblauskas,"Alfredas Bumblauskas (born 18 November 1956) is a professor at Vilnius University and one of the best known Lithuanian historians, specializing in the research of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1]

After graduating from Žemaitė school in Telšiai, he enrolled in Vilnius University in 1974. Bumblauskas received his doctoral degree in 1987, and was mentored by Edvardas Gudavičius. He was formerly dean of the Faculty of History and now heads the Department of Theory of History and Cultural History at Vilnius University.[1] He has sponsored and participated in several TV shows about history and culture (e.g. Būtovės slėpiniai with Edvardas Gudavičius).[1] Bumblauskas has been a visiting scholar at the University of Helsinki, the University of Graz, and the University of Warsaw, and is a member of the editorial board of the Przegląd Wschodni.

He is the author of Senosios Lietuvos istorija 1009–1795 (A History of Old Lithuania: 1009–1795) published in Vilnius in 2005.[1]

In 2014, Bumblauskas claimed that the relations with the Belarusians should be reconsidered (e.g. by establishing counterpropaganda institutions) because of what he called was Belarusian appropriation of the history of Lithuania.[2] Bumblauskas also stressed that Algirdas was the creator of the Lithuanian empire who annexed large parts of modern-day Belarus and Ukraine.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredas_Bumblauskas

Lithuanian declension,"Lithuanian has a  declension system that is similar to declension systems in ancient Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit, Latin or Ancient Greek. It is one of the most complicated declension systems among modern Indo-European and modern European languages.[citation needed]

Traditionally, scholars count up to ten case forms in Lithuanian. However, at least one case is reduced to adverbs and certain fixed expressions and another is extinct in the modern language. So the official variant of Lithuanian has seven cases; moreover, the illative case can be replaced with the locative case. The main cases are:

Lithuanian has two main grammatical numbers: singular and plural. There is also a dual number, which is used in certain dialects, such as Samogitian. Some words in the standard language retain their dual forms (for example du (""two"") and abu (""both""), an indefinite number and super-plural words (Lithuanian: dauginiai žodžiai). Dual forms of pronouns used in the standard language are also optional. Although grammatically the dual number can be applied to any word, in practice it was used quite sporadically during the last century. The singular and the plural are used similarly to many European languages. Singular, plural and dual inflections of the same case always differ among themselves; no rule dictates how to form, for example, the plural inflection from the singular of the same case.

Lithuanian nouns have five declensions, which are defined by the inflection in singular nominative and genitive cases. Only a few borrowed words, like taksì – taxi, tabù – taboo, kupė̃ – compartment (in a train), coupé, are not subject to declension.

Each Lithuanian consonant (except [j]) has two forms: palatalized and non-palatalized ([bʲ]-[b], [dʲ]-[d], [ɡʲ]-[ɡ] and so on). The consonants preceding vowels [i] and [e] are always moderately palatalized.

The letter i represents either the sound similar to i in the English lit or is a palatalization marker – softens the preceding consonant (ia = like e, iu = ü, io = ö; all samples where i is a softening marker are ia (ią), iu (iū, ių), io). But ie is a diphthong and there are no combinations ię and iė. Other diphthongs are: uo, ai, ei, oi (this one is used only in foreign words; in Lithuanian-derivation it is present when a word kojinė 'sock, stocking' is pronounced shorter as koinė), ui, au (palatalized iuo, iai, iui, iau; there is no iei combination because ei is already soft and same to iai; a combination ie is only a diphthong and in use is succeeded by a consonant).

Feminine nouns ending in -a, and masculine ending in -us have their palatal forms: -ia, -ius (the latter is declined in the first paradigm in its plural). The nominative singular ending -ias (sg.  nom.; the first paradigm) alone is a palatal variant of -as, but -ias pattern, differently from -ia, -ius, are not palatalized counterpart for -as (unpalatalized equivalent in sg. nominative) and there is no palatalized counterpart for -as type. The -ias pattern is a type of -ys pattern, its words are declined like -ys words, except sg. nom. -ias and, for some of the words, vocative -iau. There are only a few words of -ias type.

There are two consonants in Lithuanian, d and t, that become respectively dž [dʒ] and č [tʃ] when they precede a palatalization marker i (so, this does not include the softer sounds: i, į, y, ie, ė, e, ę) and they still have to be pronounced softer, like all other consonants preceding the palatalization marker. Examples: masc. sg. nom. svẽčias 'guest', fem. sg. nom. valdžià 'power (on somebody); government', m. sg. nom. skaĩčius 'number'; pavyzdỹs 'example', pãvyzdžio, pãvyzdžiui, pãvyzdį; kėdė̃ 'chair', kėdžių̃  etc. (Compare how T in English is pronounced like ""sh"" when followed by -ion in words like ""station"", ""revolution"", or how ""due""/ ""dew"" and ""Jew"" are pronounced identically by many English speakers).

Note that the -e ending for the vocative singular applies only to common nouns; proper nouns take the ending -ai. So, for example Jonas = 'John' [nominative] and Jonai! = 'John!' [vocative]

Only two nouns end in -i: pati 'wife' and marti 'daughter-in-law'. Their declension is same to the second adjective feminine declension.

The noun pati has the same form as the pronoun pati 'herself; myself (feminine); itself (for feminine nouns)'.

The only difference in masculine and feminine nouns of this declension is between the dative singular forms.

The palatalized variant of this declension has the forms of the first declension.

There are also two feminine nouns of the fifth declension: sesuo (sister) and duktė (daughter).

In Lithuanian, adjectives have three declensions determined by the singular and plural nominative case inflections. Adjectives agree with nouns in number, gender, and case. Unlike nouns, which have two genders – masculine and feminine – adjectives have three (except -is, -ė adjectives), but the neuter adjectives (the third example in the table) have only one uninflected form.

The personal pronouns aš (I), tu (you) jis (he, it), ji (she, it) and the reflexive pronoun savęs are declined as follows:

Note that the table contains only the objective genitive of pronouns aš, tu, savęs. The possessive genitives of these words are mano, tavo and savo respectively. Compare jis manęs laukia – 'he waits for me' and  mano draugas – 'my friend' ('friend' is in masculine), but in jis mūsų laukia – 'he waits for us' and mūsų draugas – 'our friend', the two genitives coincide as in almost any word.

Duktė – daughter, and sesuo – sister, are the only two feminine words of the fifth declension, they have the suffix -er- in the other cases. One word, moteris – woman, female, is both of the fifth and the third declensions, because it has variant genitive singular, both variants of which (-s and -ies) are equally apt, and it has a gen. pl. -ų. Two more words, dieveris m (older) – brother-in-law, and obelis f – apple tree, are the same case as moteris. The word dieveris, -ies (-ers) m, having more close meaning to a proper one, possibly has the fifth-type-like masculine singular instrumental (dieveriu), which is taken from the first declension, while the words of the third declension have -imi (dantimi, vagimi), without a gender distinction. But -imi is normal as well for the masculine nouns of the fifth declension, for example – akmenimi / akmeniu.

A word šuo – dog, differs from the other -uo words in that, that its stem is mixed with the suffix -uo and it consequently does not have the suffix -en- in the other cases (š-uo, akm-uo; šu-n-į, akm-en-į), its singular instrumental normal ending is of the third type (šunimi; that can be understood as a part of a meaning: more like an indefinite gender) and its accentuation paradigm is fourth, the sole case for the -uo words.

Mėnuo – month, moon, is of the first declension -is type, the only fifth type form is one of the two equal variants of singular nominative: mėnuo (other is mėnesis); genitive is mėnesio etc.

The word žmogus – man (human), historically had the nominative singular žmuo (compare Latin homō). Today žmogus is declined in the fourth paradigm in singular (žmogus, žmogaus etc.) and in the third -ė paradigm in plural (žmonės, žmonių etc.).

The words pats m, pati f – one/my/him/her/itself (also noun meanings: husband and wife) have also peculiarities. The ending -i (f., sg. nom.) is present only in two words: pati and marti – daughter-in-law. Pats (< patis) is of the third adjectival declensional type, but the singular nominative is different (-s < -is), plural nominative is -ys and the singular genitive -ies, like in nouns of the third declension. Its sg. gen. is also often said pačio.

The words of the third declension (-is, -ies) have either -ių or -ų in the genitive plural. The dative singular, similarly to the fifth declensional type, differs depending on the gender (-iai f, -iui m), the instrumental singular, differently from the fifth type, is the same for both genders. One noun of the third type, petys, peties, has the sg. nom. ending with a long i: -ys. Some of the words having the suffix -uonis (there are few of such words) have parallel forms in the other declensions: palikuonis, -ies (common gender) and palikuonis, -io m, palikuonė, -ės f. Such change can happen after the change of an accent place: if the word is accented on the ending -is, then the change of declension (-is, -ies > -is, -io) does not occur in speech, and if the accent moves from the ending to the stem in singular nominative, then the change of declension sometimes occurs. For most of -uonis words, declining in the first declension is considered to be a mistake.

There are few words which are sometimes declined mistakenly in other declensions. But some of the shifts are not rare: a word pats besides sg. gen. paties is often said pačio and these two forms of sg. gen. are equal. Some words have parallel forms from other declensions with a little change in a meaning: dukra, dukros; sesė, sesės; palikuonis, -io, palikuonė, -ės. The forms sesė and dukra are more like unformal, than duktė, -ers and sesuo, -ers. For the word moteris the form motera were existent in dialects, but it is, differently from dukra, sesė cases, only a formal shift of declension without a meaning variation and such word would be perceived as a vernacularism and obsolete.

The forms from the two more declensions sometimes occur in a speech for the masculine words of the fifth declension: of the third and of the first declensions. Similar case is with the masculine words of the third declension – they are sometimes declined in the first declension (because singular nominative is the same). Such a shift is a mistake of declension. For example, a word akmuo, akmens can have the forms (third d.) (sg. nom., sg. gen.) akmenis, akmenies – more like older dialectal not used widely and a little likely to be heard in a speech – and (first d.) akmenis, akmenio; akmenys, akmenio; akmenas, akmeno – sometimes said by the speakers, who don't know the fifth declension well, for example, children. But these variants are possibly also present as dialectal forms. The other examples which are sometimes used by some, but not fit are: rudenio (rudens), šunio (šuns, šunies) etc. Examples of migrants from the third declension (-is, -ies) are, for example, dantis, dančio instead of dantis, danties. Such use like akmenas, akmeno; dančio; šunio; rudenio; is a clear mistake and is not accepted. A case of petys, pečio instead of petys, peties is also a mistake, but petys is the only one -ys (instead of -is) form declined in the third declension and consequentely tends to be declined like all other -ys words (of the first declension).

For the word mėnuo / mėnesis the proper form is sg. gen. mėnesio etc. (sg. gen. mėnesies is known in dialects). The genitive of the word pats is paties, but it is also frequently said pačio. Some of the cases of the word pats are of the third adjectival declension, some – sg. nom. -s (< -is), sg. gen. -ies (also -io, like in respective adjectives) and pl. nom. -ys – of the third noun declension.

Some of the nouns occur in another declensional type only in one case. All these cases are more like dialectal and older. For example, seseris can be said seseria in dialects, but the genitive remains sesers; (older) motė, moters, but also a migrant form: (older) motė, motės. The dialectal and older form sesuva (a type of sesuo), for example, can remain in the original paradigm with sg. gen. sesers or shift to the -a declension: sesuva, sesuvos.

In the tables below the words from the fifth and the third declensions are compared with the words from the other declensions. Table cells with the correct forms written are coloured (not white). In the right outside column the variant forms within the fifth and third declensions are given. They are older, dialectal and not used or used only in small areas. For example, among the variant forms of singular nominative sesuo within the fifth declension are archaic sesuoj, sesuon, sesuva. The first column is for the words of the fifth (-uo, -ens / -ers) declension and the second for the third (-is, -ies). These declensions are very similar. The words are given in the same column, when the forms are same. The column to the right from these, are for the forms of the first (-as, -is, -ys, -ias) and second (-a (-ia), -ė) declensions; one word, žmogus, is of the fourth in singular.

The proper forms of the word mėnuo / mėnesis is not of the fifth-third declension and the same is with the word žmogus, which historically had the form žmuo. A word judesys – move, is included for comparison with mėnesis (they have the same suffix -es- and are declined in the same declension, except sg. nom. of mėnuo / mėnesis).

Dukra and sesė are variants of duktė, sesuo of a different declension and meaning – dukra and sesė are more like informal.

A word palikuonis has two forms of different declensions: one of the third (original) – palikuonis, and other shifted to the first declension – palikuonis, -io palikuonė, -ės. There are few of -uonis words and only several of them have forms other than the original declension, but in a speech some of them are also sometimes declined in the first declension, for example, geluonis, -ies c – sting, can be understood as geluonis, -io m.

For the -uo words (except mėnuo) and the -is words (like dantis) the shift to the other declensions would be a mistake. When the shift is from the fifth to the third declension it can be understood as minor variation, but the shift to the first declension would be a clear mistake (however, some of the cases are the same, and that is one of the reasons why the shift can occur). But in speech some of the speakers say, for example, rudenio instead of rudens (this can come on dialectal base), dantis, dančio instead of dantis, danties. Besides these cases, there are shifts, which occur commonly in a speech: pačio instead of paties, pečio instead of peties (the original variants are not used less). A word šuo can also be said šuva (one of dialectal variants).

The words rūgštìs f 3 (1) – acid, and rū̃gštis 2 – sourness; acidity, are two words of different declensions, their meanings are different, but related.

The a-paradigm is the most complex declension paradigm in Lithuanian. It has two different sub-paradigms, one of which is the main paradigm. The second sub-paradigm is called ""palatalized"", which means that the last consonant of the stem before the inflection is always palatalized. Note that in this case the palatalization mark (the letter ""i"") is marked as a part of the inflection. The a-paradigm is masculine.

Also note that inflection in the a-paradigm is different for nouns, adjectives, and pronouns in some cases. However, not every pronoun's declension uses the inflections from the ""pronoun"" column in the table below. Some pronouns, as well as every numeral of the a-paradigm, use the inflections from the ""adjective"" column.

Here is a list of numerals that don't use the a-paradigm in the masculine. See the o-paradigm for feminine numbers.

The u-paradigm has two different sub-paradigms, the main and the palatalized. Note, that in this case the palatalization mark (the letter ""i"") is marked as a part of the inflection. The u-paradigm is masculine.

Inflections of the u-paradigm differ between nouns and adjectives in some cases.

Note, that the inflection of the plural genitive is palatalized (-ių).

All these words use the unsuffixed sub-paradigm, except the nouns of the first declension, which apply the suffixed sub-paradigm

Note, that the word pats is declined only in masculine in this table. Its feminine form pati is declined with the o-paradigm regularly.

The dual number has its specific inflections, that are similar with plural inflections with some specific differences:

Inflections, that have two or more syllables, are often shortened in Lithuanian, eliding the final short vowel. Shortened inflections are especially used in the spoken language, while in the written language full inflections are preferred. The elision occur in:

Also there's just one occasion, when the whole one-syllable inflection may be skipped. This may be done with feminine active participles of the past tense (or of the past iterative tense) in the singular nominative. So a word dariusi - 'who was making, who has made' can be said as darius. Note, that this shortened form coincides with the sub-participle of the past tense.

The declension of Lithuanian nouns of the different declensional patterns are given compared with Latin, Sanskrit, Latvian (in a separate section), Old Prussian, Gothic, 
Ancient Greek and Russian. Because Old Prussian has left a limited literature with not all the cases of all the stems employed, the Prussian samples are not full in the tables (the cases which existed are most probably already reconstructed from various data by linguists). At the same time there were fewer cases in Prussian than in modern common Lithuanian and mixing the declension patterns was more common, what could develop in a context of a slow decline in the use of Old Prussian, as the Prussians adopted the languages of the others, particularly German. Lithuanian declension varied in dialects.

The first declension. Sg. nom. ends in -as, sg. acc. – in -ą. Latin words of this stem ends in -us in sg. nom., and -um in sg. acc. When these Latin endings succeeded a labial sound, their vowel was originally ŏ: equos – horse, equom; servos – slave, serf, servom. Sg. nom. in Prussian and Gothic is shortened: tavs, dags. Such shortening is present in western and northern Lithuanian dialects: tėvas, -o – father, and tėvs, -o; dagas, -o – heat of the sun (from degti – to burn), and dags, -o. In Prussian there existed only a shortened form, and it developed one step further in a part of the nouns: kaimis / kaimⁱs – village < kaims < kaimas (Lith. kaimas – village, kiemas – yard). There are no neuter nouns in Lithuanian and Latvian, differently from the other given here: Lith. butas – flat, living place, Prus. butan – the same meaning, Lat. aedificium – building. Lithuanian instrumental -u derives from an older -uo, what is seen, for example, in pronominal (definite) adjective forms, pronouns: gerù (nom. sg. gẽras – good) and gerúo-ju (nom. sg. geràsis – that good one), juõ (nom. sg. jis / is – he). Lithuanian diphthong uo corresponds to Latin ō. For dat. sg., an ending -uo is also known in dialects. Lithuanian acc. sg. and gen. pl. are written in the letters with an ogonek: ą and ų. An ogonek indicates that the sound is long. Historically these sounds were nasal: vilką < vilkan, vilkų < vilkun. The form with a sound -n is used in some places in north-west Samogitia today. Latin pl. dat.-abl. -īs corresponds to Ancient Greek pl. dat. -ois and Lithuanian pl. instr. -ais. Lithuanian sg. gen. corresponds to Slavic, for example, Lithuanian: vilko (also dial. vilkā) and Russian во́лка. Prussian sg. loc. was probably -ai, -ei: bītai (adverb) – in the evening, kvei – where;[1] compare Lith. namiẽ – at home (namè – in the house).

The second declension. Lithuanian and Prussian o denotes a long ō. Narrowed more, it becomes ū. When more open, it is ā; ā was used in Catechisms in Prussian, o – in Elbing vocabulary. The ą, ę correspond to ų, į in dialects of eastern Lithuania and acc. sg. is kalbų (kalbą), gėlį (gėlę) in these dialects. The case of -ų corresponds to Latvian and Slavic languages: nom. sg. liepa (Lith.) – linden, liepa (Latv.), ли́па / lipa (Rus.) and acc. sg. liepą and liepų (Lith.), liepu (Latv.), ли́пу / lipu (Rus.).

Fifth declension. Among variant declensional forms are known: sg. dat. -i, -ie: akmeni, akmenie, seseri, seserie. Sg. gen. akmenes, pl. nom. akmenes, akmens. In a case of Old Prussian emen – name, e is dropped in other than sg. nom. cases (sg. acc. emnin instead of emenin). A drop can similarly occur in other languages, for example: Lith. vanduo – water, sg. gen. variants: vandens, vandenies, vandinies, vandenio, vandinio, vandnio. Gothic wato n – water: pl. forms, for example, nom.-acc. watna.

The fourth declension. Prussian sg. nom. -us is known from Elbing vocabulary, it was shortened to -s in Catechisms. Sg. gen. -us is an innovative form, known from Catechisms, the older form was -aus. A word сынъ is given in Old Slavonic cases.

The second declension, -ė type. Prussian -ē stems became -i in an unaccented position.

Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers,"The Lithuanian Society for the Relief of War Sufferers (Lithuanian: Lietuvių draugija nukentėjusiems dėl karo šelpti) was a Lithuanian charity organization that was active from 1914 to 1918. It was founded by various Lithuanian political figures as a committee to assist Lithuanian refugees of the First World War, gradually turning into an organization supporting Lithuanian education and independence.[1]

The organization was first established in August 1914 as the Lithuanian Provisional Committee for the Relief of Victims of War by the initiative of the Lithuanian political center, an unofficial organization of representatives of various Lithuanian political parties (except social democrats). The committee initially hosted more than 1000 refugees at the start of the war. As the number of refugees grew, it was renamed to the Lithuanian Society for the Relief of Victims of War.[1]

The organization was initially centered in Vilnius, Lithuania. In 1915, up to 120 offices provided assistance for refugees, and the organization had up to 1600 members. The organization's activity was mainly headed by Martynas Yčas, a Lithuanian politician and member of the Russian Duma, as well as co-headed by future president Antanas Smetona. Finances for the organization were received from the Tatiana Committee, Russian relief organization named after Tatiana Romanov, the daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, as well as from various catholic and evangelical churches across Lithuania, the United States, and Russia. The organization established and maintained dormitories as well as feeding stations for refugees. When Vilnius was occupied by the German army in 1915 the organization split into two centers, one in Vilnius and one in Petrograd (from 1917 in Voronezh). In Russia, the organization set up orphanages for children and the elderly, schools, craft schools, as well as gymnasiums, teacher institutes, and also took care of Lithuanian students from universities abroad. They also printed Lithuanian newspapers, books, and textbooks.[1]

The organization was the progenitor of various future Lithuanian conferences and councils. It was the first Lithuanian organization to defend Lithuanian interests abroad. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Bolshevik government accused the organization of hostile activities and closed it down, confiscating its property and imprisoning chairman Martynas Yčas for two months.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Society_for_the_Relief_of_War_Sufferers
Japan–Lithuania relations,"Japan–Lithuania relations are the bilateral foreign relations between Japan and Lithuania. Japan has an embassy in Vilnius,[1] and Lithuania has an embassy in Tokyo.[2]

In February 1992, the Embassy of Japan to Lithuania was established in nearby Denmark, and in January 1997, it was moved to Vilnius. In June 1998, the Embassy of Lithuania to Japan was established in Tokyo.[3]

January 3, 1919, the date when Japan recognized Lithuania de facto[4] is considered the beginning of the bilateral relations. On February 8, 1929, the agreement by which visas were abolished was signed between Japan and Lithuania, while in 1930 the Trade and shipping agreement was signed.

On November 23, 1939, the Japanese consulate was established, led by Vice Consul Chiune Sugihara. However, due to the occupation, the consulate was shut the following year. In 1940, Chiune Sugihara assisted the flight of Jewish refugees from the imminent Nazi invasion of Lithuania by issuing them transit visas from the consulate in Kaunas, despite instructions from the Japanese Government attempting to block his actions.[5] Up to 10,000 refugees were saved with this action.[6]

There is a significant close partnership between the city of Kuji and Klaipėda, established in 1989.[7]

Japan de facto re-recognized Lithuania on September 6, 1991, and a month later diplomatic relations were re-established between these countries. In 1997 the Embassy of Japan was established in Vilnius and in 1998 the Embassy of Lithuania was established in Tokyo.[3]

In March 2016, Japan and Lithuania agreed to cooperate on nuclear safety.[8][9]

In August 2016, Training Squadron vessels of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Kashima, Asagiri and Setoyuki sailed into Klaipėda port, to celebrate 25th anniversary of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between this sovereign republic in the Baltic region and the maritime nation in the Far East. Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Linas Antanas Linkevičius welcomed the Japanese vessels and their steadfast partnership based on the same fundamental values since 1991 as well as referred an honorable and righteous diplomat Chiune Sugihara,[10] who served as the Japanese Vice-Consul at Kaunas from 1939 to 1940 and granted visas to thousands of Jewish and other minority refugees in his short term of office.[11] The JMSDF Training Squadron also visited Lithuanian Military Academy, where some students and officers train Kendo, a modern Japanese martial arts descended from Bushido and swordsmanship. On August 10, a sports exchange event between Japanese and Lithuanian officers was held at the military academy, and the Lithuanian team won the Kendo match to Japanese team.[12]

In April 2001, Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus paid an official visit to Japan, and on April 11, he held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori about their views on several issues that includes their bilateral relations, Japan–Russia relations and Lithuania's accession to EU and NATO.[13]

In May 2007, the Emperor and Empress of Japan, Akihito and Michiko, made an official visit to Lithuania.[14][15]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan–Lithuania_relations
History of Estonia,"The history of Estonia forms a part of the history of Europe. Human settlement in what is now Estonia became possible 13,000–11,000 years ago, after the ice from the last glacial era had melted, and signs of the first permanent population in the region date from around 9000 BC.[1]

The medieval indigenous population of Estonia was one of the last pagan civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Northern Crusades in the 13th century.[2] After the crusaders had conquered the area by 1227, Estonia was ruled initially by the King of Denmark in the north (until 1345), and until 1559 by the Teutonic Order, and by the ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire, which from 1418 to 1562 covered the whole of Estonia, forming a part of the Livonian Confederation. After 1559, Estonia became part of the Kingdom of Sweden until 1710, when the Tsardom of Russia (Muscovy) conquered the entire area during the Great Northern War of 1700–1721. Throughout this period the local German-speaking nobility enjoyed significant autonomy, and High German (earlier also Low German and Latin) served as the main language of administration and education.

The Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750–1840) led to the Estonian national awakening in the middle of the 19th century. In the aftermath of World War I (1914–1918) and the revolutions of 1917 that brought the end to the Russian Empire, Estonia was declared an independent democratic republic in February 1918. In the Estonian War of Independence (1918–1920) the newly proclaimed state successfully fought against the Soviet Russian Bolshevist invasion, and in the February 1920 Russian-Estonian Peace Treaty the Soviet Russia recognised Estonian independence in perpetuity.

During World War II (1939–1945) the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia in June 1940 and illegally annexed the country.[a] In the course of Operation Barbarossa, Nazi Germany occupied Estonia in 1941; the Soviet Army reoccupied Estonia in 1944. Estonia regained its independence in August 1991 and joined the European Union and NATO in 2004.

The region has been populated since the end of the Late Pleistocene glaciation, about 9,000 BC. The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with the Kunda culture. The early Mesolithic Pulli settlement is located by the Pärnu River. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda culture received its name from the Lammasmäe settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500 BC.[6] Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern Lithuania and southern Finland. Among minerals, flint and quartz were used the most for making cutting tools.

The beginning of the Neolithic Period is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, and appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva-type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.

Around the beginning of 4th millennium BC Comb Ceramic culture arrived in Estonia.[7] Until the early 1980s the arrival of Balto-Finnic peoples, the ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, and Livonians, on the shores of the Baltic Sea was associated with the Comb Ceramic Culture.[8] However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with linguistic ones cannot be proven, and it has been suggested that the increase of settlement finds in the period is more likely to have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate. Some researchers have even argued that a Uralic language may have been spoken in Estonia and Finland since the end of the last glaciation.[9]

The burial customs of the comb pottery people included additions of figures of animals, birds, snakes and men carved from bone and amber. Antiquities from comb pottery culture are found from northern Finland to eastern Prussia.

The beginning of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 BC is characterized by the appearance of the Corded Ware culture, pottery with corded decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes). Evidence of agriculture is provided by charred grains of wheat on the wall of a corded-ware vessel found in Iru settlement. Osteological analysis show an attempt was made to domesticate the wild boar.[10]

Specific burial customs were characterized by the dead being laid on their sides with their knees pressed against their breast, one hand under the head. Objects placed into the graves were made of the bones of domesticated animals.[7]

The beginning of the Bronze Age in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 BC. The development of the borders between the Finnic peoples and the Balts was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of Saaremaa and Iru in northern Estonia, began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, and stone cist graves and cremation burials became increasingly common, alongside a small number of boat-shaped stone graves.[11]

About the 7th century BC, a large meteorite hit Saaremaa island and created the Kaali craters.

About 325 BC, the Greek explorer Pytheas possibly visited Estonia. The Thule island he described has been identified as Saaremaa by Lennart Meri,[12] though this identification is not widely considered probable, as Saaremaa lies far south of the Arctic Circle.

The Pre-Roman Iron Age began in Estonia about 500 BC and lasted until the middle of the 1st century AD. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square Celtic fields surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds, began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.
The Roman Iron Age in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the Roman Empire. In material culture this is reflected by a few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas, while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas—northern Estonia, southern Estonia, and western Estonia including the islands—had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.[13]

The name ""Estonia"" occurs first in a form of Aestii in the 1st century AD by Tacitus; however, it might have indicated Baltic tribes living in the area. In the Scandinavian sagas (9th century) the term started to be used to indicate the Estonians.[14]

Ptolemy in his Geography III in the middle of the 2nd century AD mentions the Osilians among other dwellers on the Baltic shore.[15]

According to the 5th-century Roman historian Cassiodorus, the people known to Tacitus as Aestii were the Estonians. The extent of their territory in early medieval times is disputed, but the nature of their religion is not. They were known to the Scandinavians as experts in wind-magic, as were the Sami people (known at the time as Finns) in the North.[16] Cassiodorus mentions Estonia in his book V. Letters 1–2 dating from the 6th century.[17]

The Chud people, mentioned in early Rus' chronicles, starting with the Primary Chronicle, are thought to be the Ests or Esthonians by some historians.[18]

In the 1st centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (kihelkond) and the county (maakond). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).[19]

Varbola Stronghold was one of the largest circular rampart fortresses and trading centers built in Estonia, Harju County (Latin: Harria) at the time.

In the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the Vikings from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.
With the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually led to the Baltic crusades.
The east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: first the Livs, Letts and Estonians, then the Prussians and the Finns underwent defeat, baptism, military occupation and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.[20]

Estonia was one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be Christianized. In 1193 Pope Celestine III called for a crusade against pagans in Northern Europe. The Northern Crusades from northern Germany established the stronghold of Riga (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of Livs and Letts, the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the Sword Brethren and their recently converted allies won a major battle in which the Estonian commander Lembitu was killed.

Northern Estonia was conquered by Danish crusaders led by king Waldemar II, who arrived in 1219 on the site of the Estonian town of Lindanisse[21] (now Tallinn) at (Latin) Revelia (Estonian) Revala or Rävala, the adjacent ancient Estonian county. The Danish Army defeated the Estonians at the Battle of Lindanise.

The Estonians of Harria started a rebellion in 1343 (St. George's Night Uprising). The province was occupied by the Livonian Order as a result. In 1346, the Danish dominions in Estonia (Harria and Vironia) were sold for 10 000 marks to the Livonian Order.

The first written mention of the Estonian Swedes comes from 1294, in the laws of the town of Haapsalu. Estonian Swedes are one of the earliest known minorities in Estonia. They have also been called ""Coastal Swedes"" (Rannarootslased in Estonian), or according to their settlement area Ruhnu Swedes, Hiiu Swedes etc. They themselves used the expression aibofolke (""island people""), and called their homeland Aiboland.

The ancient areas of Swedish settlement in Estonia were Ruhnu Island, Hiiumaa Island, the west coast and smaller islands (Vormsi, Noarootsi, Sutlepa, Riguldi, Osmussaar), the northwest coast of the Harju District (Nõva, Vihterpalu, Kurkse, the Pakri Peninsula and the Pakri Islands), and Naissaar Island near Tallinn. The towns with a significant percentage of Swedish population have been Haapsalu and Tallinn.

In earlier times Swedes also lived on the coasts of Saaremaa, the southern part of Läänemaa, the eastern part of Harjumaa and the western part of Virumaa.

In 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold on the Estonian island of Saaremaa. After the conquest, all the remaining local pagans of Estonia were ostensibly Christianized. An ecclesiastical state Terra Mariana was established. The conquerors exercised control through a network of strategically located castles.[22]

The territory was then divided between the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order, the Bishopric of Dorpat (in Estonian: Tartu piiskopkond) and the Bishopric of Ösel-Wiek (in Estonian: Saare-Lääne piiskopkond). The northern part of Estonia – more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) – was a nominal possession of Denmark until 1346. Tallinn (Reval) was given the Lübeck Rights in 1248 and became the northernmost member city of the Hanseatic League at the end of the 13th century. In 1343, the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion (St. George's Night Uprising) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and four elected Estonian ""kings"" were killed in Paide during peace negotiations in 1343. Vesse, the rebel King of Saaremaa, was hanged in 1344.[23] Despite the rebellions, and Muscovite invasions in 1481 and 1558, the Middle Low German-speaking minority established themselves as the dominating force in the society of Estonia, both as traders and the urban middle-class in the cities, and as landowners in the countryside, through a network of manorial estates.[24]

The Protestant Reformation in Europe that was initiated in 1517 by Martin Luther spread rapidly to Estonia in the 1520s.  Lutheranism spread literacy among the commoners. However, many peasants were traditionalists and more comfortable with Catholic traditions; they delayed the adoption of the new church. After 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less of a burden, and altars often featured depictions of the Last Supper, but images and statues of the saints had disappeared.[25] Church services were now given in the local vernacular, instead of Latin, and the first books were printed in Estonian.[26]

During the Livonian War in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control, while southern Estonia briefly came under the control of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 1580s. In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of Estonia in the north and Livonia in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early 20th century.

Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor asked for help of Gustav I of Sweden, and the Kingdom of Poland also began direct negotiations with Gustavus, but nothing resulted because on 29 September 1560, Gustavus I Vasa died. The chances for success of Magnus von Lyffland and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 and 1570. In the former case he had been recognised as their sovereign by the Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek and the Bishopric of Courland, and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of the Bishopric of Dorpat; the Bishopric of Reval with the Harrien-Wierland gentry were on his side; and the Livonian Order conditionally recognised his right of ownership of the principality of Estonia. Then, along with Archbishop Wilhelm von Brandenburg of the Archbishopric of Riga and his coadjutor Christoph von Mecklenburg, Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of the Kingdom of Livonia which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land. Once Eric XIV of Sweden became king, he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with Muscovy and spoke to the burghers of Reval city. He offered them goods to submit to him, as well as threatening them. By 6 June 1561, they submitted to him, contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish princess Catherine Jagiellon. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to Finland, Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent. Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly and lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of Riga. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his inheritance of Holstein. After Sweden occupied Reval, Frederick II of Denmark made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement, and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on 7 August 1562, in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and the Northern Seven Years' War between the Free City of Lübeck, Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568, Erik XIV became insane, and his brother Johan III took his place. Johan III ascended to the throne of Sweden, and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King Sigismund II Augustus of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, know that he was ready for peace. On 13 December 1570, the Treaty of Stettin was concluded. It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to the Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the Livonian War a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called ""Peace Party"". Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with Ivan the Terrible, proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.

The Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces – scattered bands of household troops (Hofleute) under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 (Battle of Pärnu and Siege of Reval (1565)), in 1570–1571 (Siege of Reval (1570–1571); 30 weeks), and in 1574–1576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of Wiek to the Danish Crown and the loss of the territory to the Muscovites). In 1575 after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition, as did the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with Rzeczpospolita. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita, and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.

Having rejected peace proposals from its enemies, Ivan the Terrible found himself in a difficult position by 1578, when the Crimean Khanate devastated southern Muscovian territories and burnt down suburb(posad) of Moscow (see Russo-Crimean Wars), the drought and epidemics had fatally affected the economy, the policy of oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government, while the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had united with the Kingdom of Poland and acquired an energetic leader, Stefan Batory, supported by the Ottoman Empire (1576). Batory replied with a series of three offensives against Muscovy, trying to cut the Kingdom of Livonia from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men he retook Polotsk. During the second, in 1580, with a 29,000-strong army he took Velikie Luki, and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the Siege of Pskov. Frederick II had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike Sweden and Poland. He came to an agreement with John III of Sweden in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish–Lithuanian control of Ducatus Ultradunensis only in 1582. After Magnus von Lyffland died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the Duchy of Courland and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of Œsel, Denmark was out of the Baltic by 1585. In 1598 Polish Livonia was divided into:

During 1582–83 southern Estonia (Livonia) became part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Duchy of Estonia placed itself under Swedish rule in 1561 to receive protection against Russia and Poland as the Livonian Order lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present-day Estonia.

Livonia was conquered from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1629 in the Polish–Swedish War. By the Treaty of Oliva between the Commonwealth and Sweden in 1660 following the Northern Wars the Polish–Lithuanian king renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day Latvia (Vidzeme region).

In 1631, Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden forced the nobility to grant the rural commoners greater autonomy. During his rule, in 1632, the first printing press, and the university was established in the city of Tartu.

Sweden's defeat by Russia in the Great Northern War resulted in the capitulation of Estonia and Livonia in 1710, confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad in 1721, and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, Lutheran church, local and town governments, secondary and higher education continued mostly in German language until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.

Under the imperial Russian rule, from the 1720s to the First World War, in Estonia the local Baltic German minority continued to own most of the land and businesses, and dominated in all cities. The local German-speakers were Lutherans, and so were the vast majority of the Estonian population. Moravian Protestant missionaries made an impact in the eighteenth century, and translated the complete Bible into Estonian. Some Germans complained, the imperial government banned the Moravians from 1743 to 1764. A theological faculty opened at the University of Dorpat (Tartu), with German professors. The local German gentry controlled the local churches and rarely hired Estonian graduates, but they made their mark as intellectuals and Estonian nationalists. In the 1840s, there was a movement of Lutheran farmers into the Russian Orthodox Church. The czar discouraged them when he realized they were challenging the local authorities.[27] The German character of the Lutheran churches alienated many nationalists, who emphasized the secular in their subcultures. For example, choral societies offered a secular alternative to church music.[28]

By 1819, the Baltic provinces were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, enabling an increasing number of farmers to rent or purchase land, as well as triggering a wave of internal migration of landless rural Estonians into the growing cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the Estonian national identity, as the country was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-19th century. The general population, as well as the students and faculty of the multicultural University of Tartu, were largely uninterested in the Russification programmes introduced by the imperial Russian central government in the 1890s.[29]

Educated German immigrants and local Baltic Germans in Estonia, educated at German universities, introduced Enlightenment ideas of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality. The French Revolution provided a powerful motive for the ""enlightened"" local upper class to create literature for the commoners.[30] The abolition of serfdom on in 1816 in southern Estonia (then Governorate of Livonia), and 1819 in northern Estonia (then Governorate of Estonia) by Emperor Alexander I of Russia gave rise to a debate as to the future fate of the Estonian-speaking population. Although many Baltic Germans regarded the future of the Estonians as being a fusion with the Germans, many other educated and Estophile Germans admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century.[31] The Estophile Enlightenment Period formed the transition from religious Estonian literature to newspapers printed in Estonian for the general public.

A cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of Estonian as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. Kalevipoeg, Estonia's national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.

1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of Russification. The impact of this was that many of the Baltic German legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian – a good example of this is the University of Tartu.

As the Russian Revolution of 1905 swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for freedom of the press and assembly, for universal franchise, and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.

Estonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian February Revolution of 1917. With the collapse of the Russian Empire in World War I, Russia's Provisional Government granted national autonomy to a unified Estonia in April. The Governorate of Estonia in the north (corresponding to the historic Danish Estonia) was united with the northern part of the Governorate of Livonia. Elections for a provisional parliament, Maapäev, was organized, with the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party obtaining a part of the vote. On 5 November 1917, two days before the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, Estonian Bolshevik leader Jaan Anvelt violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maapäev in a coup d'état, forcing the Maapäev underground.

In February, after the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the German Empire, mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans. Bolshevik forces retreated to Russia. Between the Russian Red Army's retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the Salvation Committee of the Estonian National Council Maapäev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence[32] in Pärnu on 23 February 1918.

After the collapse of the short-lived puppet government of the United Baltic Duchy and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an Estonian Provisional Government retook office. A military invasion by the Red Army followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence (1918–1920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of the Red Army by February 1919. On 5–7 April 1919 the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected.

By the summer of 1919, Estonia had reached its largest territorial extent ever, having pushed the Red Army far beyond Estonia's borders on the Southern and Eastern fronts, with the assistance of the Northwestern army under the Estonian command in the east.

On 2 February 1920, the Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and the Russian SFSR. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia.

The first Constitution of Estonia was adopted on 15 June 1920. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the League of Nations in 1921.

The first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a sovereign state. Economically and socially, land reform in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the Baltic nobility were redistributed among farmers and especially among volunteers in the Estonian War of Independence. Estonia's principal markets became Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and western Europe, with some exports to the United States and to the Soviet Union.

The first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a parliamentary form of government. The parliament (Riigikogu) consisted of 100 members elected for three-year terms. Between 1920 and 1934, Estonia had 21 governments.

A mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary Vaps Movement emerged in the 1930s.[33] In October 1933, a referendum on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent.[33] The league spearheaded replacement of the parliamentary system with a presidential form of government and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive self-coup on 12 March 1934, by then Head of State Konstantin Päts, who established his own authoritarian rule until a new constitution came to force in 1938. The parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938, and the country was ruled by decree by Päts. The Vaps Movement was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an amnesty and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.

The interwar period was one of great cultural advancement.[34] Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to minority groups comprising at least 3,000 persons, including Jews (see history of the Jews in Estonia). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly ""700-year German rule"" as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.

Estonia had pursued a policy of neutrality, but it was of no consequence after the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939. In the agreement, the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland), with Estonia falling in the Soviet ""sphere of influence"". After the invasion of Poland, the Orzeł incident took place when Polish submarine ORP Orzeł looked for shelter in Tallinn but escaped after the Soviet Union attacked Poland on 17 September. Estonia's lack of will and/or inability to disarm and intern the crew caused the Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of ""helping them escape"" and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On 24 September 1939, the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country—an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.

Following the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet invasion of Poland, warships of the Red Navy appeared off Estonian ports on 24 September 1939, and Soviet bombers began a threatening patrol over Tallinn and the nearby countryside.[35] Moscow demanded Estonia assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war.[36] The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement on 28 September 1939.

The Republic of Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940.[37][38][39]

On 12 June 1940, the order for a total military blockade of Estonia by the Soviet Baltic Fleet was given.[40][41]

On 14 June 1940, while the world's attention was focused on the fall of Paris to Nazi Germany a day earlier, the Soviet military blockade of Estonia went into effect, and two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane Kaleva flying from Tallinn to Helsinki carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in Tallinn, Riga and Helsinki. US Foreign Service employee Henry W. Antheil Jr. was killed in the crash.[42]

On 16 June 1940, the Soviet Union invaded Estonia.[43] Molotov accused the Baltic states of conspiracy against the Soviet Union and delivered an ultimatum to Estonia for the establishment of a government approved of by the Soviets.

The Estonian government decided, given the overwhelming Soviet force both on the borders and inside the country, not to resist, to avoid bloodshed and open war.[44] Estonia accepted the ultimatum, and the statehood of Estonia de facto ceased to exist as the Red Army exited from their military bases in Estonia on 17 June. The following day, some 90,000 additional troops entered the country. The military occupation of the Republic of Estonia was rendered official by a communist coup d'état supported by the Soviet troops,[45] followed by parliamentary elections where all but pro-Communist candidates were outlawed. The newly elected parliament proclaimed Estonia a Socialist Republic on 21 July 1940 and unanimously requested Estonia to be accepted into the Soviet Union. Those who had fallen short of the ""political duty"" of voting Estonia into the USSR, who had failed to have their passports stamped for so voting, were allowed to be shot in the back of the head by Soviet tribunals.[46] Estonia was formally annexed into the Soviet Union on 6 August and renamed the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.[47] In 1979, the European Parliament would condemn ""the fact that the occupation of these formerly independent and neutral States by the Soviet Union occurred in 1940 following the Molotov/Ribbentrop pact, and continues,"" and sought to help restore Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian independence through political means.[48]

The Soviet authorities, having gained control over Estonia, immediately imposed a regime of terror. During the first year of Soviet occupation (1940–1941) over 8,000 people, including most of the country's leading politicians and military officers, were arrested. About 2,200 of the arrested were executed in Estonia, while most of the others were moved to Gulag prison camps in Russia, from where very few were later able to return alive. On 14 June 1941, when mass deportations took place simultaneously in all three Baltic countries, about 10,000 Estonian civilians were deported to Siberia and other remote areas of the Soviet Union, where nearly half of them later perished. Of the 32,100 Estonian men who were forcibly relocated to Russia under the pretext of mobilisation into the Soviet army after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, nearly 40 percent died within the next year in the so-called ""labour battalions"" of hunger, cold and overworking. During the first Soviet occupation of 1940–41 about 500 Jews were deported to Siberia.

Estonian graveyards and monuments were destroyed. Among others, the Tallinn Military Cemetery had the majority of gravestones from 1918 to 1944 destroyed by the Soviet authorities, and this graveyard became reused by the Red Army.[49] Other cemeteries destroyed by the authorities during the Soviet era in Estonia include Baltic German cemeteries established in 1774 (Kopli cemetery, Mõigu cemetery) and the oldest cemetery in Tallinn, from the 16th century, Kalamaja cemetery.

Many countries including the United States did not recognize the seizure of Estonia by the USSR. Such countries recognized Estonian diplomats and consuls who still functioned in many countries in the name of their former governments. These aging diplomats persisted in this anomalous situation until the ultimate restoration of Baltic independence.

Ernst Jaakson, the longest-serving foreign diplomatic representative to the United States, served as vice-consul from 1934, and as consul general in charge of the Estonian legation in the United States from 1965 until reestablishment of Estonia's independence. On 25 November 1991, he presented credentials as Estonian ambassador to the United States.[50]

After Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, and the Wehrmacht reached Estonia in July 1941, most Estonians greeted the Germans with relatively open arms and hoped to restore independence. But it soon[when?] became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied ""Ostland"". A Sicherheitspolizei was established for internal security under the leadership of Ain-Ervin Mere. The initial enthusiasm that accompanied the liberation from Soviet occupation quickly waned as a result, and the Germans had limited success in recruiting volunteers. The draft was introduced in 1942, resulting in some 3,400 men fleeing to Finland to fight in the Finnish Army rather than join the Germans. Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 (Estonian: soomepoisid) was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation.

By January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. Narva was evacuated. Jüri Uluots, the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service. (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38,000 volunteers jammed registration centers.[51] Several thousand Estonians who had joined the Finnish army came back across the Gulf of Finland to join the newly formed Territorial Defense Force, assigned to defend Estonia against the Soviet advance. It was hoped that by engaging in such a war Estonia would be able to attract Western support for the cause of Estonia's independence from the USSR and thus ultimately succeed in achieving independence.[52]

The initial formation of the volunteer SS Estonian legion created in 1942 was eventually expanded to become a full-sized conscript division of the Waffen-SS in 1944, the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. The Estonian units saw action defending the Narva line throughout 1944.

As the Germans started to retreat on 18 September 1944, Jüri Uluots, the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the Allies. On 22 September 1944, as the last German units pulled out of Tallinn, the city was re-occupied by the Soviet Red Army. The new Estonian government fled to Stockholm, Sweden, and operated in exile from 1944 until 1992, when Heinrich Mark, the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president Lennart Meri.

The process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, when in 1865 Russian Tsar Alexander II granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the Republic of Estonia, and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of its existence as a state, Estonia showed tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting its territories.[citation needed] On 12 February 1925, the Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3,000. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to the global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the Government of the Republic of Estonia with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement.[53]

There were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 2,000 Estonian Jews. Many Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 500 Jews suffered this fate. With the invasion of the Baltics, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltic countries as their main area of mass genocide. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated. Out of the approximately 4,300 Jews in Estonia prior to the war, between 1,500 and 2,000 were entrapped by the Nazis,[54] and an estimated 10,000 Jews were killed in Estonia after having been deported to camps there from Eastern Europe.[53]

There have been seven ethnic Estonians – Ralf Gerrets, Ain-Ervin Mere, Jaan Viik, Juhan Jüriste, Karl Linnas, Aleksander Laak and Ervin Viks – who have faced trials for crimes against humanity since the reestablishment of Estonian independence and the formation of the Estonian International Commission for Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity.[55] Markers were put in place for the 60th anniversary of the mass executions that were carried out at the Lagedi, Vaivara[56] and Klooga (Kalevi-Liiva) camps in September 1944.[57]

The Baltic Germans had voluntarily evacuated to Germany (in accordance with Hitler's order) following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939.

Almost all the remaining Estonian Swedes fled Aiboland in August 1944, often in their small boats to the Swedish island of Gotland.

The Russian minority grew significantly in numbers during the postwar era.

In World War II Estonia had suffered huge losses. Ports had been destroyed, and 45% of industry and 40% of the railways had become damaged. Estonia's population had decreased by one-fifth, about 200,000 people.[58] Some 10% of the population (over 80,000 people) had fled to the West between 1940 and 1944, first to countries such as Sweden and Finland and then to other western countries, often by refugee ships such as the SS Walnut. More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. In 1944 Russian air raids had destroyed Narva and one-third of the residential area in Tallinn. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces had ushered in a second phase of Soviet rule on the heels of the German troops withdrawing from Estonia, and followed it up by a new wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.[citation needed]

An anti-Soviet guerrilla movement known as the Metsavennad (""Forest Brothers"") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the Metsavennad; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000–35,000 people. Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.

In March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.

After the war the Communist Party of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.

After Stalin's death, Communist Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of perestroika the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 7% of the country's population.

One positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the regranting of permission in the late 1950s for citizens to make contact with foreign countries. In the 1960s, Estonians were thus able to start watching Finnish television. This electronic ""window to the West"" afforded Estonians more information on current world affairs and more access to contemporary Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union.

In the late 1970s, Estonian society grew increasingly concerned about the threat of cultural Russification to the Estonian language and national identity. By 1981, Russian was taught in the first grade of Estonian-language schools and was also introduced into Estonian pre-school teaching.

Tallinn was selected to host the sailing events at the 1980 Summer Olympics, which led to controversy[59] since many governments had not de jure recognized ESSR as part of the USSR. During the preparations to the Olympics, sports buildings were built in Tallinn, along with other general infrastructure and broadcasting facilities. This wave of investment included Tallinn Airport, Hotell Olümpia, Tallinn TV Tower, Pirita Yachting Centre and Linnahall.[60]

On 10 November 1982, Leonid Brezhnev died and was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, the former head of the KGB. Andropov introduced limited economic reforms and established an anti-corruption program. On 9 February 1984, Andropov died and was succeeded by Konstantin Chernenko who in turn died on 10 March 1985.[61]

By the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the Estonian Popular Front, established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership and broad constituency. The Greens and the dissident-led Estonian National Independence Party soon followed.

The Estonian Sovereignty Declaration was issued on 16 November 1988.[62] By 1989 the political spectrum had widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily. The republic's Supreme Soviet transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (16 November 1988); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that November; a language law making Estonian the official language (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).

Despite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front's proposal to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called ""third republic"" whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment, found less and less support over time.

A grassroots Estonian Citizens' Committees Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a Congress of Estonia. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of the Estonian Republic which still existed de jure, recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens' committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nationwide structure, and by the beginning of 1990 over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia.

The spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On 24 February 1990, the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn 11–12 March 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee (Eesti Komitee) was elected with Tunne Kelam as its chairman.

In March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than ""re""-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against.

Although the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of Russian speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.

In the 18 March 1990, elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet, all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of left and centrist parties and led by former Central Planning Committee official Edgar Savisaar, gained a parliamentary majority.

On 8 May 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (renamed the previous day) changed the name to the Republic of Estonia. Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which Latvia and Lithuania incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the attempted August coup in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its telecommunications facilities, thereby offering the West a clear view into the latest developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia's own ""confirmation"" of independence on 20 August 1991. 20 August remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this. Russia as a republic of the U.S.S.R. formally recognized Estonia's independence on 25 August 1991 and called on the U.S.S.R. union government to follow suit.[63] The United States intentionally delayed recognition to 2 September,[64] and the State Council of the Soviet Union issued its recognition on 6 September.

Since the debates about whether the future independent Estonia would be established as a new republic or a continuation of the first republic were not yet complete by the time of the August coup, while the members of the Supreme Soviet generally agreed that independence should be declared rapidly, a compromise was hatched between the two main sides: instead of ""declaring"" independence, which would imply a new start, or explicitly asserting continuity, the declaration would ""confirm"" Estonia as a state independent of the Soviet Union, and willing to reestablish diplomatic relations of its own accord. The text of the statement was in Estonian and only a few paragraphs in length.[65]

After more than three years of negotiations, on 31 August 1994, the armed forces of Russia withdrew from Estonia. Since fully regaining independence Estonia has had sixteen governments with ten prime ministers: Mart Laar, Andres Tarand, Tiit Vähi, Mart Siimann, Siim Kallas, Juhan Parts, Andrus Ansip, Taavi Rõivas, Jüri Ratas and Kaja Kallas. The PMs of the interim government (1990–1992) were Edgar Savisaar and Tiit Vähi.

Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. Estonia opened accession negotiations with the European Union in 1998 and joined in 2004, shortly after becoming a member of NATO.

On 28 June 1992, Estonian voters approved the constitutional assembly's draft constitution and implementation act, which established a parliamentary government with a president as chief of state and with a government headed by a prime minister. The Riigikogu, a unicameral legislative body, is the highest organ of state authority. It initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. The prime minister has full responsibility and control over his cabinet.

Parliamentary and presidential elections were held on 20 September 1992. Approximately 68% of the country's 637,000 registered voters cast ballots. Lennart Meri, an outstanding writer and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, won this election and became president. He chose 32-year-old historian and Christian Democratic Party founder Mart Laar as prime minister.

In February 1992, and with amendments in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an ambitious programme of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures (shock therapy). Fast privatization was pursued and the role of the state in the economy as well as in the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came with a social price: the average life expectancy in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova.[66] Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' demonstration took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month[67]). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs Marju Lauristin.[68]

On 28 September 1994, the MS Estonia sank as the ship was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. The disaster claimed the lives of 852 people  (501 of them were Swedes[69]), being one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century.[70]

The opposition won the 1995 election, but to a large extent continued with the previous governments' policies.

In 1996, Estonia ratified a border agreement with Latvia and completed work with Russia on a technical border agreement. President Meri was re-elected in free and fair indirect elections in August and September in 1996. During parliamentary elections in 1999, the seats in the Riigikogu were divided as follows: the Estonian Centre Party received 28, the Pro Patria Union 18, the Estonian Reform Party 18, the People's Party Moderates (election cartel between Moderates and People's Party) 17, Coalition Party 7, Country People's Party (now People's Union of Estonia) 7, and the United People's Party's electoral cartel 6 seats. Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, and the Moderates formed a government with Mart Laar as prime minister, whereas the Centre Party with the Coalition Party, People's Union, United People's Party, and members of parliament who were not members of factions formed the opposition in the Riigikogu.

The 1999 Parliamentary election, with a 5% threshold and no electoral cartel allowed, resulted in a disaster for the Coalition Party, which achieved only seven seats together with two of its smaller allies. Estonian Ruralfolk Party, which participated the election on its own list, obtained seven seats as well.

The programme of Mart Laar's government was signed by Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, the Moderates, and the People's Party. The latter two merged soon after, so Mart Laar's second government is widely known as Kolmikliit, or the Tripartite coalition. Notwithstanding the different political orientation of the ruling parties, the coalition stayed united until Laar resigned in December 2001, after the Reform Party had broken up the same coalition in Tallinn municipality, making opposition leader Edgar Savisaar the new mayor of Tallinn. After the resignation of Laar, the Reform Party and Estonian Centre Party formed a coalition that lasted until the next parliamentary election, in 2003.

The Moderates joined with the People's Party on 27 November 1999, forming the People's Party Moderates.

In fall 2001 Arnold Rüütel became the President of the Republic of Estonia, and in January 2002 Prime Minister Laar stepped down. On 28 January 2002, the new government was formed from a coalition of the centre-right Estonian Reform Party and the more left wing Centre Party, with Siim Kallas from the Reform Party of Estonia as Prime Minister.[71]

Following parliamentary elections in 2003, the seats were allocated as follows (the United People's Party failed to meet the 5% threshold):

Voter turnout was higher than expected at 58%.[72] The results saw the Centre Party win the most votes, but they were only 0.8% ahead of the new Res Publica party.[73] As a result, both parties won 28 seats, which was a disappointment for the Centre Party who had expected to win the most seats.[74] Altogether the right of centre parties won 60 seats, compared to only 41 for the left wing, and so were expected to form the next government.[71][75] Both the Centre and Res Publica parties said that they should get the chance to try and form the next government,[76] while ruling out any deal between themselves.[77] President Rüütel had to decide who he should nominate as Prime Minister and therefore be given the first chance at forming a government.[77] On 2 April he invited the leader of the Res Publica party, Juhan Parts, to form a government,[78] and after negotiations a coalition government composed of Res Publica, the Reform Party and the People's Union of Estonia was formed on 10 April.[78]

On 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the European Union. With 64% of the electorate turning out, the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.

In February 2004 the People's Party Moderates renamed themselves the Social Democratic Party of Estonia.[79]

Estonia joined NATO on 29 March 2004.[80]

On 8 May 2004, a defection of several Centre Party members to form a new party, the Social Liberal Party, over a row concerning the Centrists' ""no"" stance to joining the European Union changed the allocation of the seats in the Riigikogu. Social-liberals had eight seats, but a hope to form a new party disappeared by 10 May 2005, because most members in the social-liberal group joined other parties.

On 24 March Prime Minister Juhan Parts announced his resignation following a vote of no confidence in the Riigikogu against Minister of Justice Ken-Marti Vaher, which was held on 21 March. The result was 54 pro (Social Democrats, Social Liberals, People's Union, Pro Patria Union and Reform Party) with no against or neutral MPs. 32 MPs (Res Publica and Centre Party) did not take part.[81]

On 4 April 2005, President Rüütel nominated Reform party leader Andrus Ansip as Prime Minister designate and asked him to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005.[82] Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new cabinet, on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.[citation needed]

On 18 May 2005, Estonia signed a border treaty with the Russian Federation in Moscow.[83] The treaty was ratified by the Riigikogu on 20 June 2005. However, in the end of June the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaty and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaty because the Riigikogu had attached a preambule to the ratification act that referenced earlier documents that mentioned the Soviet occupation and the uninterrupted legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia during the Soviet period. The issue remains unsolved and is the focus of European-level discussions.

On 4 April 2006, Fatherland Union and Res Publica decided to form a united right-conservative party. The two parties joining was approved on 4 June by both parties in Pärnu. The joined party name is Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit (Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica).[84]

In September 2006, Toomas Hendrik Ilves was elected as the new president of Estonia. He defeated in the Electoral Assembly incumbent one-term president Arnold Rüütel.[85]

The 2007 parliamentary elections have shown an improvement in the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica lost 16. Socialdemocrats gained 4 seats, while the Greens entered the Parliaments with 7 seats, at the expense of the agrarian People's Union which lost 6. The new configuration of the Estonian Parliament shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn Edgar Savisaar, has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with Putin's United Russia party, real estate scandals in Tallinn,[86] and the Bronze Soldier controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority.[87] The lack of a concrete possibility for government alternance in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.[88]

On 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the European Union. With 64% of the electorate turning out the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against.[89] Accession to the EU took place the following year, on 1 May 2004. Estonia became Schengen area member on 21 December 2007[90]

In its first European Parliament elections in 2004, Estonia elected three MEPs for the Social Democratic Party (PES), while the governing Res Publica Party and People's Union polled poorly, not being able to gain any of the other three MEP posts. The voter turnout in Estonia was one of the lowest of all member countries, at only 26.8%. A similar trend was visible in most of the new member states that joined the EU in 2004.

The European Parliament election of 2009 in Estonia scored a 43.9% turnout – about 17.1% higher than during the previous election, and slightly above the European average of 42.94%. Six seats were up for taking in this election: two of them were won by the Estonian Centre Party. Estonian Reform Party, Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica, Social Democratic Party and an independent candidate Indrek Tarand (who gathered the support of 102,460 voters, only 1,046 votes less than the winner of the election) all won one seat each. The success of independent candidates has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and the use of closed lists which rendered voters incapable of casting a vote for specific candidates in party lists.

On 1 January 2011 Estonia adopted the euro.[91] The enlargement of the eurozone was hailed as a good sign in a period of global financial crisis. However, the government cut down public service salaries; the only opposition, in the absence of organised unions, came from Estonian teachers, whose salary cuts were therefore limited.[88]

Estonian euro coins entered circulation on 1 January 2011. Estonia was the fifth of ten states that joined the EU in 2004, and the first ex-Soviet republic to join the eurozone. Of the ten new member states, Estonia was the first to unveil its design. It originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007; however, it did not formally apply when Slovenia did, and officially changed its target date to 1 January 2008, and later, to 1 January 2011.[92] On 12 May 2010 the European Commission announced that Estonia had met all criteria to join the eurozone.[93] On 8 June 2010, the EU finance ministers agreed that Estonia would be able to join the euro on 1 January 2011.[94] On 13 July 2010, Estonia received the final approval from the ECOFIN to adopt the euro as from 1 January 2011. On the same date the exchange rate at which the kroon would be exchanged for the euro (€1 = 15.6466 krooni) was also announced. On 20 July 2010, mass production of Estonian euro coins began in the Mint of Finland.[95]

Being a member of the eurozone, NATO and the European Union, Estonia is the most integrated in Western European organizations of all Nordic states.[96]

Estonia–Russia relations remain tense. According to the Estonian Internal Security Service, Russian influence operations in Estonia form a complex system of financial, political, economic and espionage activities in the Republic of Estonia for the purposes of influencing Estonia's political and economic decisions in ways considered favourable to the Russian Federation and conducted under the sphere-of-influence doctrine known as near abroad.[citation needed] According to the Centre for Geopolitical Studies, the Russian information campaign, which the centre characterises as a ""real mud-throwing"" exercise, had provoked a split in Estonian society amongst Russian speakers, inciting some to riot over the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, a cenotaph commemorating the soldiers killed in World War II.[97] Estonia regarded the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia as an information operation intended to influence the decisions and actions of the Estonian government. While Russia denied any direct involvement in the attacks, hostile rhetoric in the media from the political elite influenced people to attack.[98] Following the 2007 cyber-attacks, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) was established in Tallinn.[99]

In August 2011, President Toomas Hendrik Ilves was re-elected in a vote in parliament for the second five-year term.[100] Center-right Reform Party was the biggest party in 2011 and 2015 parliamentary elections.[101] Estonian prime minister Andrus Ansip resigned in March 2014, after nine years in office since 2005. He wanted his successor to lead the Reform Party into 2015 elections.[102] In April 2014, Taavi Rõivas of the Reform party became new prime minister.[103] In October 2016, Estonia's parliament elected Kersti Kaljulaid as the new president of Estonia.  The role of president is a largely ceremonial.[104] In November 2016,  chairman of the Centre Party Jüri Ratas became the new prime minister of Estonia, after Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas had lost a parliamentary vote on confidence.[105]

In March 2019, Estonian parliamentary election the center-right opposition party Reform won the elections and ruling Centre was the second. Far-right Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) came third.[106] After the election prime minister Ratas formed a new three-party coalition government with far-right EKRE and rightwing Isamaa[107]
In January 2021, prime minister Jüri Ratas resigned over a corruption scandal in his Centre Party.[108] The leader of Reform party Kaja Kallas formed a new two-party coalition government between the Reform and Center parties. She was the first female prime minister of Estonia. Her father Siim Kallas was the founder of the Reform party and he was prime minister of Estonia in 2002–2003.[109][110]

After the formation of the new government in 2021, Estonia was the only country in the world that was led by elected women as the head of state and as the head of government: both the president, Kersti Kaljulaid, and prime minister, Kaja Kallas, were female.[111]
In the cabinet of Kaja Kallas there were also several women in other key positions, both foreign minister and finance minister were female.[112] Mr. Alar Karis was sworn in as Estonia's sixth President on 11 October 2021.[113]

In July 2022, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas formed a new three-party coalition by her liberal Reform Party, the Social Democrats and the conservative Isamaa party. Her previous government had lost its parliamentary majority after the center-left Center Party left the coalition.[114]

In March 2023, the Reform party, led by Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, won the parliamentary election, taking 31,4% of the vote. Far-right Conservative People's Party came second with 16,1 % and the third was the Centre Party with 15% of the vote.[115] In April 2023, Kallas formed her third government, which included in addition to Reform Party, also the liberal Estonia 200 and the Social Democratic (SDE) parties.[116]

In July 2024, Kristen Michal became Estonia's new prime minister to succeed Kaja Kallas, who resigned as prime minister on July 15 to become the European Union's new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.[117]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Estonia
January Events,"The January Events (Lithuanian: Sausio įvykiai) were a series of violent confrontations between the civilian population of Lithuania, supporting independence, and the Soviet Armed Forces. The events took place between 11 and 13 January 1991, after the restoration of independence by Lithuania. As a result of the Soviet military actions,[2][3] 14 civilians were killed and over 140 were injured as they peacefully protested for freedom in what is known as the Vilnius massacre.[4][5][6] The 13th of January was the most violent day of the month in Lithuania and this was the bloodiest act of repression by Soviet forces since the April 9 tragedy.[7] The events were primarily centered in the capital city Vilnius, but Soviet military activity and confrontations also occurred elsewhere in the country, including Alytus, Šiauliai, Varėna and Kaunas.[8]

January 13th is the Day of the Defenders of Freedom (Lithuanian: Laisvės Gynėjų Diena) in Lithuania and it is officially observed as a commemorative day.[9]

The Baltic states, including Lithuania, were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The illegal occupation was never recognized by Western powers leading to the Baltic states' continuity.

The Republic of Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union on 11 March 1990 and thereafter underwent a difficult period of emergence. During March–April 1990 the Soviet Airborne Troops (VDV) occupied buildings of the Political Education and the Higher Party School where the alternative Communist Party of Lithuania, on the CPSU platform, later encamped.

The Soviet Union imposed an economic blockade between April and late June.[10] Economic and energy shortages undermined public faith in the newly restored state. The inflation rate reached 100% and continued to increase rapidly. In January 1991 the Lithuanian government was forced to raise prices several times and this was used for organization of mass protests of the so-called ""Russophone population"" of the country.[11]

During the five days preceding the killings, Soviet, Polish, and other workers at Vilnius factories protested the government's consumer goods price hikes and what they saw as ethnic discrimination.[12] According to Human Rights Watch, the Soviet government had mounted a propaganda campaign designed to further ethnic strife. This and other actions would give the Soviets a pretext for intervention when they later would send elite armed forces and special service units for the protection of the rallied Russophone population minority.[10][11]

On 8 January the conflict between Chairman of the Parliament Vytautas Landsbergis and the more pragmatic Prime Minister Kazimira Prunskienė culminated in her resignation.[10] Prunskienė met with Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev on that day. He refused her request for assurances that military action would not be taken.[10]

On the same day the pro-Moscow Yedinstvo movement organized a rally in front of the Supreme Council of Lithuania.[13] Protesters tried to storm the parliament building but were driven away by unarmed security forces using water cannons. Despite a Supreme Council vote the same day to halt price increases, the scale of protests and provocations backed by Yedinstvo and the Communist Party increased. During a radio and television address, Landsbergis called upon independence supporters to gather around and protect the main governmental and infrastructural buildings.

From 8–9 January several special Soviet military units were flown to Lithuania (including the counter-terrorism Alpha Group and paratroopers of the 76th Guards Air Assault Division of the VDV based at Pskov). The official explanation was that this was needed to ensure constitutional order and the effectiveness of laws of the Lithuanian SSR and the Soviet Union.

On 10 January Gorbachev addressed the Supreme Council, demanding a restoration of the constitution of the USSR in Lithuania and the revocation of ""all anti-constitutional laws"".[13] He mentioned that military intervention could be possible within days. When Lithuanian officials asked for Moscow's guarantee not to send armed troops, Gorbachev did not reply.

In the morning, Landsbergis and Prime Minister Albertas Šimėnas were presented with another ultimatum from the ""Democratic Congress of Lithuania"" demanding that they comply with Gorbachev's request by 15:00 on 11 January.[14]

During an overnight session of the Supreme Council, Speaker Landsbergis announced that he had tried to call Gorbachev three times, but was unsuccessful. Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, General Vladislav Achalov, arrived in Lithuania and took control of all military operations. People from all over Lithuania started to encircle the main strategic buildings: the Supreme Council, the Radio and Television Committee, the Vilnius TV Tower and the main telephone exchange.[15]

Following these two attacks, large crowds (20,000 during the night, more than 50,000 in the morning) of independence supporters gathered around the Supreme Council building. People started building anti-tank barricades and setting up defences inside surrounding buildings. Provisional chapels were set up inside and outside the Supreme Council building. Members of the crowd prayed, sang and shouted pro-independence slogans. Despite columns of military trucks, BMPs and tanks moving into the vicinity of the Supreme Council, Soviet military forces retreated instead of attacking.

Among the members of the barricade were two basketball players who would later play for the Lithuanian national team, Gintaras Einikis and Alvydas Pazdrazdis.[17]

In all, thirteen Lithuanians were killed by the Soviet army.[18] An additional civilian died at the scene due to a heart attack, and one Soviet soldier was killed by friendly fire. All victims, except the Soviet soldier, were awarded the Order of the Cross of Vytis (the Knight) on January 15, 1991.[18]

12 of the 14 victims were buried in the Antakalnis Cemetery in Vilnius. Titas Masiulis was buried in Petrašiūnai Cemetery in his native Kaunas, Rimantas Juknevičius was buried in the Marijampolė cemetery.

Immediately after the attacks, the Supreme Council issued a letter to the people of the Soviet Union and to the rest of the world denouncing the attacks and calling for foreign governments to recognise that the Soviet Union had committed an act of aggression against a sovereign nation. Following the first news reports from Lithuania, the government of Norway appealed to the United Nations. The government of Poland expressed their solidarity with the people of Lithuania and denounced the actions of the Soviet army.

The reaction from the United States government was somewhat muted as they were heavily preoccupied with the imminent onset of Operation Desert Storm against Iraq and worried about possible wider consequences if they were to offend the Soviets at that critical juncture.[19] President George H. W. Bush denounced the incident, calling it ""deeply disturbing"" and that it ""threatens to set back or perhaps even reverse the process of reform"" in the Soviet Union.[20] Bush was notably careful not to criticize Gorbachev directly, instead directing his remarks at ""Soviet leaders"".[citation needed]

After the events, Gorbachev said that Lithuanian ""workers and intellectuals"" complaining of anti-Soviet broadcasts had tried to talk to the Lithuanian parliament, but they were refused and beaten.[21] Then, he said, Lithuanian ""workers and intellectuals"" asked the military commander in Vilnius to provide protection.[22] Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, Interior Minister Boris Pugo and Gorbachev all asserted that no one in Moscow gave orders to use force in Vilnius.[21] Yazov claimed that nationalists were trying to form what he called a bourgeois dictatorship. Pugo alleged on national television that the demonstrators had opened fire first.[23]

During the following day, meetings of support took place in many cities (Kyiv, Riga, Tallinn) and some had defensive barricades built around their government districts.

Although occupation and military raids continued for several months following the attacks, there were no large open military encounters after 13 January. Strong Western reaction and the actions of Soviet democratic forces put the President and the government of the Soviet Union in an awkward position. This influenced future Lithuanian-Russian negotiations and resulted in the signing of a treaty on 31 January.

During a visit by the official delegation of Iceland to Lithuania on 20 January Foreign Minister Jón Baldvin Hannibalsson said: ""My government is seriously considering the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with the Republic of Lithuania."" Iceland kept its promise, and on 4 February 1991, just three weeks after the attacks, it recognized the Republic of Lithuania as a sovereign independent state, and diplomatic relations were established between the two nations.

These events are considered some of the main factors that led to the overwhelming victory of independence supporters in a referendum on 9 February 1991. 84.73% of registered voters voted, of which 90.47% of them voted in favour of the full and total independence of Lithuania.

Streets in the neighborhood of the TV tower were later renamed after nine victims of the attack. A street in Titas Masiulis' native Kaunas was named after him, likewise a street in Marijampolė after its native, Rimantas Juknevičius, a street in Kėdainiai after Alvydas Kanapinskas, and a street in Pelėdnagiai (near Kėdainiai) after Vytautas Koncevičius.

From the interview of Mikhail Golovatov, ex-commander of ""Alpha-group"": ""The weapons and ammunition that were given to us, were handed over at the end of the operation, so it can be established that not a single shot was fired from our side. But at the time of the assault, our young officer Victor Shatskikh was mortally wounded in the back. As we have already seized the TV tower and went outside, we came under fire from the windows of the neighbouring houses, and leaving from there we had to hide behind the armoured vehicles.""[24]

In 1996, two members of the Central Committee of Communist Party of the Lithuanian SSR, Mykolas Burokevičius and Juozas Jermalavičius, were given prison sentences for their involvement in the January Events. In 1999 the Vilnius District Court sentenced six former Soviet military men who participated in the events. On 11 May 2011, a soldier of the Soviet OMON Konstantin Mikhailov was sentenced to life in prison for killing customs workers and policemen in 1991 at the ""Medininkai"" border checkpoint with the Byelorussian SSR near the village of Medininkai (see Soviet aggression against Lithuania in 1990).

Since 1992, representatives of the Prosecutor General's Office of Lithuania requested Belarus to extradite Vladimir Uskhopchik, a former general who was in command of the Vilnius garrison in January 1991 and the editor of the newspaper Soviet Lithuania Stanislava Juonienė.[25] Lithuania's request has been repeatedly denied.

In July 2011, diplomatic tensions rose between Austria and Lithuania when Mikhail Golovatov, an ex-KGB general who took part in the 13 January 1991 massacre, was released after being detained at the Vienna Airport. He then proceeded to fly to Russia. In response, Lithuania recalled its ambassador from Austria.[26]

Hearings in Vilnius District Court started on 27 January 2016, with 67 individuals facing charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, battery, murder, endangering other's well-being, as well as unlawful military actions against civilians. The case consists of 801 volumes of documents, including 16 volumes of the indictment itself.[27] The defendants included former Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, former commander of Soviet Alpha anti-terror group Mikhail Golovatov and Vladimir Uskhopchik.

Robertas Povilaitis, a surviving son of one of the victims, requested that law enforcement authorities conduct an investigation into Gorbachev's role in the events. On 17 October 2016, Vilnius Regional Court decided to summon Gorbachev to testify as a witness.[28] The Russian Federation refused to question Gorbachev. As no pre-trial investigation has been initiated against Gorbachev in the January 13 case, the Chairman of the Constitutional Court of Lithuania Dainius Žalimas argued that it is hard to believe that the events happened without the knowledge of the President of the USSR.[29] The role of Mikhail Gorbachev in the January events remains disputed.[2]

In 2018 Russia's law enforcement began criminal proceedings against the Lithuanian prosecutors and judges who were investigating the case.[30] Such Russian action was condemned by the European Parliament as ""unacceptable external influence"" and ""politically motivated.""[31][32]

On 27 March 2019, Vilnius District Court found all 67 defendants guilty of war crimes or crimes against humanity.[33][34] The vast majority of them were tried and sentenced in absentia. Among the high-profile defendants, former Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Mikhail Golovatov to 12 years in prison and Vladimir Uskhopchik to 14 years in prison. Others were sentenced to prison terms between 4 and 12 years.[34]

On 31 March 2021, the Lithuanian Court of Appeal announced its judgement, which only increased the time of imprisonment for the sentenced and awarded non-pecuniary damage of 10.876 million Euro to the victims.[35] A judge, who announced the judgement, said that: ""As they drove with the tanks over the people, they understood perfectly well what they were doing.""[36] Thereafter, Russia threatened to take retaliatory actions for the judgement.[37][38] The European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders had promised that the European Union will defend Lithuanian judges who heard the January 13 case from persecution by Russia.[39] Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lithuania Gabrielius Landsbergis said that Lithuania will appeal to Interpol to reject Russia's appeal against the persecution of Lithuanian judges who heard the January 13 case.[40]

In 2019, Russia and Belarus refused to extradite those who are responsible for the January Events.[33][41]

As of March 2021 many of the 66 defendants remain out of reach of Lithuanian justice.[42]

January 13th is the Day of the Defenders of Freedom (Lithuanian: Laisvės Gynėjų Diena) in Lithuania. It is not a public holiday, but it is officially observed as a commemorative day.[9] It is a vividly remembered day in the Lithuanian national memory.[43][44] The day has been associated with mourning[45] and the national flags are usually raised[46] with a black ribbon attached. In recent years, forget-me-not flower pins have become a symbol of commemoration of the events.[47]

Recently there have been public debates whether January 13th (and the events in general) should be viewed as the day of mourning or should rather be celebrated as the day of victory.[48] Former Lithuanian leaders Landsbergis and Dalia Grybauskaitė expressed the view that 13th January is not only the day of mourning and commemorating those who sacrificed their lives, but also the day of national victory.[49][50] Other prominent public figures described January 13th as a Victory Day, including Arvydas Pocius and Valdemaras Rupšys, both of whom were volunteers defending the Parliament during the events, as well as Rimvydas Valatka,[2] Marius Laurinavičius [lt],[3] Vytautas Ališauskas [lt].[45]

Lithuania has since accused Russia of trying to spread disinformation about the January Events.[3][51] The European Parliament has condemned Russia and urged to ""cease the irresponsible disinformation and propaganda statements"" regarding the 13 January case.[32] EUvsDisinfo has documented several examples of disinformation in the pro-Kremlin media.[52]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_Events

Ministry of National Defence (Lithuania),"The Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos krašto apsaugos ministerija) is the government institution of Lithuania responsible for the organization of national defence.[4] It was originally established in 1918 upon the independence of Lithuania and reestablished following the end of Soviet rule in 1991.

The first cabinet ministers of the Republic of Lithuania were appointed on 11 November 1918, and the position of defence minister was initially assumed by prime minister Augustinas Voldemaras.[1] The situation in Lithuania was tense after World War I. The first decree concerning national defence was issued on 23 November 1918, which is officially considered the day of the formation of the Lithuanian Armed Forces.[2] On 24 December 1918, lieutenant general Mykolas Velykis became the defence minister but served for just two days; he was replaced by Jonas Vileišis. The country began mobilizing its population as soon as the defence ministry was formed, as it had to defend its sovereignty in the Lithuanian Wars of Independence (1918–1920).[2]

Following the end of Soviet rule and the restoration of Lithuania's independence on 11 March 1990, the Lithuanian defence ministry was reestablished on 25 April 1990. The ministry celebrates 25 April annually with public ceremonies in Kaunas and Vilnius.[5]

The Defence Materiel Agency (Lithuanian: Gynybos Resursų Agentūra) is an institution under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defence, and it is responsible for defence procurement and strategies.[7][8]

As of 2023, about 100 people work for the Defence Materiel Agency.[9]

In 2022, the Lithuanian Ministry of Economy and Innovation awarded the Defence Materiel Agency for ""high standards in its public procurement practices"".[10][11]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Defence_(Lithuania)
Jaunutis,"Jaunutis (Polish: Jawnuta; Belarusian: Яўнут; lit. 'young man'; Christian name: Ioann; also John or Ivan; c. 1300 – after 1366) was Grand Duke of Lithuania after his father Gediminas died in 1341 until he was deposed by his elder brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis in 1345.[1]

According to Polish historian Jan Tęgowski, he was probably born between 1306 and 1309.[2]

Jaunutis was not mentioned in any written sources prior to Gediminas' death.[3] Before Gediminas' death, all his sons had been granted a domain of Lithuania. Only the second-youngest son, Jaunutis, had not received any domains but lived with his parents in Vilnius. When his father died, he automatically became the ruler of Vilnius and the nearby lands. In Gediminas' time, it was already customary to regard the Duke of Vilnius as the ruler of the whole Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[4] There are many theories why Gediminas chose Jaunutis, a middle son, as his successor. Some suggested that he was an acceptable compromise between pagan (Algirdas and Kęstutis) and Orthodox (Narimantas, Karijotas, Liubartas) sons of Gediminas.[5] Others claimed that Jaunutis was the eldest son of Gediminas' second wife; thus the tradition that Gediminas was married twice: to a pagan and to an Orthodox duchess.[6]

Very little is known about the years when Jaunutis ruled. Those were quite peaceful years, as the Teutonic Knights were led by the ineffective Ludolf König.[3] His brothers were much more active: Algirdas attacked Mozhaysk, Livonian Order, defended Pskov, Kęstutis was helping Liubartas in succession disputes in Galicia–Volhynia.[5]

Seeing that Jaunutis hesitates to provide help with their military campaigns, his two elder brothers, Algirdas and Kęstutis, agreed to remove Jaunutis and take power into their own hands. Kęstutis, who ruled the nearby Duchy of Trakai, unexpectedly captured Vilnius, he summoned Algirdas and let him rule the whole Duchy of Vilnius. As compensation, the brothers gave Jaunutis the Duchy of Zasłaŭje, but Jaunutis did not want to yield and refused the duchy.[4]

The Bychowiec Chronicle mentions that Jaunutis was supported by Jaunė, the presumed wife of Gediminas and mother of his children. She died c. 1344 soon after Jaunutis lost his throne. If he was indeed protected by his mother, then it would be an interesting example of influence held by queen mother in pagan Lithuania.[3] However, a concrete stimulus might have been a major reise planned by the Teutonic Knights in 1345.[5]

Jaunutis was supported by his brother Narimantas, who traveled to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, to form an alliance against Algirdas and Kęstutis. Jaunutis was imprisoned in Vilnius, but managed to escape and went to his Russian brother-in-law Simeon of Moscow. There Jaunutis was baptized as Ioann, but failed to solicit help (possibly because his sister Aigusta, wife of Simeon, died the same year).[7] Both Jaunutis and Narimantas had to reconcile with Algirdas. Jaunutis became the Duke of Zasłaŭje.[6] The other brothers willingly recognised Vilnius for Algirdas. [4]

He is presumed to have died c. 1366 because he is mentioned for the last time in a treaty with Poland in 1366, and not mentioned in a treaty with Livonia in 1367.[6] He had three sons, Symeon Zaslawski, Grzegorz Słucki and Michal Zaslawski.[8] Michal ruled Zasłaŭje until his death on August 12, 1399 in the Battle of the Vorskla River.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaunutis
FK Sūduva,"FK Sūduva is a Lithuanian professional football club based in the city of Marijampolė. Founded in 1968, the club competes in the A Lyga, the top flight of Lithuanian football.

The club has been playing in the A Lyga since 2002. In 2006, the club won its first trophy – the Lithuanian Cup, a feat they repeated in 2009.[1] In 2017, Sūduva won the A Lyga for the first time in its history, and repeated the triumph in 2018 and 2019.

The team's colours are white and red. The club plays at Marijampolė Arena in Marijampolė (capacity 6,250).

Sūduva is one of the oldest and still functioning clubs in Lithuania. It is not so easy to trace its history, as in Soviet times it often changed names with every new owner that supported it. It is more or less agreed that officially this club has existed under the name of Sūduva since 1968. This date (1968) known, because officially was founded Sūduva as football club.

During Soviet times it drifted between different local leagues, producing few footballers for the above-mentioned Žalgiris and slowly building a local football community. Football was also actively played in a few smaller towns around Marijampolė, thus making the community of football lovers even stronger. Actually, it was stronger than the club itself, and those who follow the team today are adding to the old tradition.

The biggest achievement of the club during Soviet times came in 1975 when Sūduva reached 3rd place at the local top division. The next year it played and lost the National Cup Final.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union Sūduva got few chances to go up. It played the only Baltic championship in 1990 with teams from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Next year it tried the Lithuanian top division. Both efforts were terrible – Sūduva finished both championships as the last team collecting 7 points at the Baltic championship and only 2 at the Lithuanian league.

Later the team navigated between the 2nd and the 3rd divisions for some 10 years without decent funds or a truly professional attitude. The worst was the season of 1998 / 1999. The team started well at the 2nd division but left it after half a season because it had no funds. It was not the end. The football traditions were too strong.

The team recovered next season at the 3rd division, won it the following year, went up and won again. This rise continues up to this day.

The season of 2002 shaped the future. The team reached the top division. It also reached the finals of the National Cup and gained the chance to take part in the UEFA Cup. But the most important thing was that it also got new owners who were determined to create a normally functioning and financially predictable club. The European campaign of that year added some good emotions to the general hype.

The semi-professional team vanquished Brann from Norway during its first European match (3–2 both away and at home) and went to Glasgow to meet Celtic. This match was not so successful (actually, the result is still featured in the statistics of Celtic as one of the biggest victories in Europe).

Three more seasons at the middle of the table and the team reached 3rd place – 30 years after the achievement of the same caliber. Repeating that history, the club reached the finals of the National Cup the following year. Only this time the Cup went to Marijampolė.

Since that year Sūduva have been one of the most stable clubs of the country – both financially and on the league table. It reached 2nd position twice (2007 and 2010), 3rd position – three times (2009, 2011 and 2012) and won the National Cup one more time (2008). It went to play European cups every year receiving teams like Rapid, Red Bull and Club Brugge.

The year 2013 saw a new concept of the team. The budget was still stable but it went down. So the team expressed the wish to put more stress on integration of young local boys into the main team. Some important players of the earlier seasons left; a few foreign players came to stand along those who left and the new blood.

So that was the year of experiments. The team was much younger, less experienced and clearly weaker. It was many seasons before Sūduva was a clear member of 2–4 teams that were clear leaders of the championship. The question was only about what kind of medals each team would get. That year the situation was much tougher for Sūduva. It was clear that the team would need a lot of effort and luck if it wanted to get its traditional silver or bronze.

In the 2015 season, Sūduva started with a new head coach – Aleksandr Veselinovič. The new coach totally changed the team style from defending to attacking. In the last season game against Atlantas Sūduva needed at least a draw. Sūduva conceded a goal in the 86th minute and lost 3rd place to Atlantas.

At the beginning of the 2016 season, Sūduva recalled former team players Marius Činikas and Martynas Matuzas. Multiple A Lyga champions Algis Jankauskas, Andro Švrljuga and Paulius Janušauskas were signed as well. Also signed were Croatian goalkeeper Ivan Kardum, Serbian forward Admir Kecap, Bosnian-Herzegovinian defensive midfielder Nermin Jamak and Serbian midfielder Predrag Pavlović. Sūduva finished season 3rd, also played in the Cup final the same year.

Cheburin was attributed to a lot of club's success over the past 3 seasons.

In January 2020, Heimo Pfeifenberger became the new head coach,[5] however amidst COVID-19 pandemic, Heimo's and the club's views on player salaries and remote training have become different, and on 14 April the club terminated the contract.[6][7][8]

Lithuanian partisans (1941),"Lithuanian partisans is a generic term used during World War II by Nazi officials[1] and quoted in books by modern historians[2][3] to describe Lithuanian anti-communist fighters, thus collaborators with the Nazis during the first months of the German occupation of Lithuania during World War II. A part of the Lithuanian partisans who fought against the Red Army during the June Uprising, were later organized into various auxiliary units by German Nazis. A minority of the units assisted and actively participated in mass executions of the Lithuanian Jews mostly in June–August 1941.

The term ""Lithuanian partisans"" might apply to several different and unrelated groups during 1941 and later:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_partisans_(1941)
Lithuanian identity card,"Lithuanian Personal Identity Card is the officially recognised  identity document issued to Lithuanian citizens.

The Personal Identity Card is a limited travel document, valid for travel within most European nations.

Aside from being unable to be used for international travel to other than previously mentioned countries, the passport card is treated as a passport for all other purposes. A Personal Identity Card can be used as primary evidence of Lithuanian citizenship, just like a passport and can be used as a valid proof of citizenship and proof of identity both inside and outside Lithuania

Since 2009, Personal Identity Cards are equipped with contact chips, allowing their usage as digital signature devices with a smart card reader. The Identity documents personalisation centre under the Lithuanian Ministry of the Interior provides digital signature software for Windows, Linux and Mac OS environments.

The first Lithuanian Personal Identity Cards were issued in January 2003. The issuance of these card continued until January, 2009, when they were superseded with biometric and digital signature-capable second-generation personal identity cards. In July 2012 issuance of slightly altered third-generation personal identity cards started.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_identity_card
Administrative divisions of Lithuania,"Lithuania is now a country in the Baltic region of Europe.

In the earliest stages of the formation of the Lithuanian state, the area included several ""lands"" (Lithuanian: plural – žemės, singular – žemė), such as Nalšia, Deltuva and Lietuva (as well as others), each ruled by a regional duke. When King Mindaugas (r. 1251–1263) unified the state, he killed, expelled, or subjugated most of the regional dukes. The lands were either added to the new ruler's domain or granted to members of his family.

As the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into Slavic lands, title to the acquired principalities was given to the Grand Duke's offspring or to others of his relatives. For example, Mindaugas granted Black Ruthenia with its center in Navahrudak to his son Vaišvilkas, Grand Duke Gediminas (1316–1341) sent his brother Teodoras to Kiev.[1] This system had major disadvantages: the principalities remained semi-independent with loose ties to the central government. Rulers of these principalities could operate as powerful rivals to the Grand Duke, a situation that led to frequent power-struggles.[2]

In early-15th century Grand Duke Vytautas the Great (r. 1392–1430) initiated administrative reforms. He replaced regional dukes and princes with trustworthy nobles who depended on the favor of the Grand Duke. This marked the rise of Lithuanian nobility. In 1413 the Lithuanians and the Poles signed the Union of Horodło; Vilnius and Trakai Voivodeships formed in ethnic Lithuanian lands, copying the Polish system. The Eldership of Samogitia had a special semi-autonomous status. Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political, social, administrative features;[3] they slowly became  incorporated into the administration of the Grand Duchy. The Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471, five other voivodeships were set up between 1504 and 1514.[2] The Smolensk Voivodeship, the largest of all, was established in 1508, but was lost to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1514.

Voivodeships (Lithuanian: plural – vaivadijos, singular – vaivadija), ruled by appointed officials – voivodes, were further subdivided into powiats (Lithuanian: plural – pavietai, singular – pavietas).

Major administrative reforms took place in 1564–1566 in preparation for the second Statute of Lithuania of 1566 and the overhaul of the judicial system.[4]
The entire territory of the Grand Duchy, with exception of Samogitia, was divided into 12 voivodeships.

Just before the Union of Lublin (1569), four voivodeships (Kiev, Podlaskie, Bracław, and Wołyń) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the Polish Crown by direct order of Sigismund II Augustus while the Duchy of Livonia, acquired in 1561, became a condominium (joint domain) of both Lithuania and Poland.[2] This left Lithuania with eight voivodeships and one eldership:

After the Livonian War (1558–1582), Lithuania acquired the vassal state of Duchy of Courland with its capital Jelgava. This administrative division remained without any major changes until the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century.

Under the Russian Empire, the territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania was divided into governorates (Russian: guberniya, Lithuanian: gubernija) and districts (Russian: uyezd, Lithuanian: apskritis). Such system was introducing in Russia during the reforms of 1775.[2] The first governorates, Vilna Governorate (consisting of eleven districts) and Slonim Governorate, were established after the third partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Just a year later, on December 12, 1796, they were merged into one governorate, called Lithuania Governorate, with capital in Vilnius.[6] In 1801 Lithuania Governorate was split into Lithuania-Vilna Governorate and Lithuania-Grodno Governorate. Forty years later the word ""Lithuania"" was dropped from the two names and official maps of Europe. The territory of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania became known as the Northwestern Krai.[2] In 1843 another administrative reform took place, creating Kovno Governorate out of seven western districts of the Vilna Governorate. Vilna Governorate received three additional districts: Vileyka and Dzisna from Minsk Governorate and Lida from Grodno Governorate.[2]

In 1837 Augustów Governorate was established in the territories of the Congress Poland, a state in personal union with Russia. Lithuanian Suvalkija was included into this governorate. After the January Uprising, Augustów Governorate was split into Suwałki Governorate and Łomża Governorate (see Administrative division of Congress Poland).[2] This way most of the present-day territory of Lithuania fell into three governorates (Vilna, Kovno, and Suwałki). Two more governorates included some small Lithuanian territories. In 1819 a narrow coastal strip with Palanga and Šventoji was transferred to the Courland Governorate. This territory was acquired from Latvia after an international arbitration in 1920.[6] Small areas in northernmost Grodno Governorate were given to Lithuania after it ""joined"" the Soviet Union in 1940.[7]

In 1861, after announcing the abolition of serfdom, peasants acquired civil rights, among them a right to self-governmence. To facilitate such a right townships (Russian: volost, Lithuanian: valsčius) and elderates (Russian: mir, Lithuanian: seniūnija) were established. By the end of 1861 there were 1,479 elderates in 181 townships of Vilna Governorate and 1,033 elderates in 153 townships of Kovno Governorate.[8] The elderates would elect an elder (Russian: starosta, Lithuanian: seniūnas) and representatives to a township council (Lithuanian: valsčiaus sueiga). However, these institutions had very little power and were dependent on the local nobles. The power was concentrated in the hands of governors, all of whom were appointed by the tsar.

During the interwar period, Lithuania regained independence. The first law on administrative sub-units was passed on July 1, 1919. It declared that Lithuania was divided into twenty counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys). Several more counties (including Zarasai, Naujieji Švenčionys, Vilnius, Eišiškės, Lida, Ashmyany and Hrodna) were reserved for territories in the Vilnius Region, that Lithuania had claims to, but were under Polish or Russian control.[9] Later on Suwałki county was lost to Poland, but Zarasai (also known as Ežerėnai) county was acquired. Two of the designated counties, Trakai and Sejny, had their proclaimed capitals outside the de facto borders of Lithuania and had their temporary capitals established at Kaišiadorys and Lazdijai. After the Klaipėda Region was acquired in 1923, it was divided into three counties (Klaipėda, Šilutė and Pagėgiai).[9] That way the number of counties increased to twenty three and remained stable until 1939. According to a law passed in 1931 eleven first-class cities became independent of county administration and had their own government.[10] In March 1939, after an ultimatum from Hitler, Lithuania lost the Klaipėda Region with its three counties. In October Soviet Union returned one fifth of the Vilnius Region in exchange for Red Army stations in Lithuania. Acquired Vilnius Region was divided into three counties (Vilnius, Eišiškės, and Naujieji Švenčionys).[2] Therefore, at the end of 1939 Lithuania again had twenty three counties. Counties were further subdivided into townships (Lithuanian: singular – valsčius, plural – valsčiai). In 1933 there were 365 townships.[9] The townships were further subdivided into elderates (Lithuanian: seniūnija).

The counties were governed by a county governor (Lithuanian: apskrities viršininkas), appointed by the Minister of Interior. Being almost the only link between the central government and the local population, governors were first responsible for a wide range of duties. They were to collect all property left by the retreating German army, organize local government, recruit local army groups, ensure security and stability in the county, etc.[11] In 1920 they were also entrusted to preside over county police. In 1931, in an effort to centralize the government, county governors also became the chairmen of a three-member county governing body (Lithuanian: apskrities valdyba), an executive institution of a county council.[11] That way power in a county became centralized in the hands of a governor. County councils (Lithuanian: apskrities taryba) were elected by local population for a three-year term. The number of representatives from a township depended upon the number of residents in that township.[12]

These were the counties, their territory and residents according to the 1923 census:[13]

Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union on June 15, 1940. However, due to ensuring World War II the authorities did not introduce major changes to the administrative divisions, just elderates were renamed to apylinkė.[14] After the second occupation in 1944, the number of counties grew from 26 to 41: eleven counties were added in 1946–47 and four more were introduced in 1949.[15] At the end of 1947 there were 37 counties subdivided into 320 townships that were further subdivided into approximately 2,900 apylinkės.[16]

The entire interwar system was scrapped for the 10th anniversary of the first occupation. The new system matched that of other Soviet Republics. On July 20, 1950 Lithuanian SSR was divided into four regions (Russian: oblast, Lithuanian: sritis).[2] The regions were further subdivided into 87 districts (Russian: raion, Lithuanian: rajonas): Kaunas Region with 23 districts, Klaipėda Region with 16 districts, Šiauliai Region with 24 districts, and Vilnius Region with 24 districts.[17]

The townships were abolished and the districts were further subdivided into apylinkės. In 1984 there were 527 apylinkės in Lithuania.[14] Both regions and districts were named after their capitals. Three exceptions were: Smėliai District had its capital in Ukmergė (also capital of Ukmergė district), Panemunė District – capital Garliava, and Klaipėda District – capital Gargždai. In addition to districts, there were five (Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Šiauliai, and Panevėžys) region-administered cities (Lithuanian: srities pavaldumo miestas).[18] They had similar rights as a district.

The regions were short-lived and on May 28, 1953, they were abolished, leaving the districts as the first-level administrative division. The number of districts was reduced several times, and in 1962 it settled at 44.[2] The region-administered cities were renamed to republic-administered cities (Lithuanian: respublikinio pavaldumo miestas). The number of such cities grew to eleven in 1979.[18] These cities became the city municipalities after the reform in 1994.

In 1994, an administrative division of Lithuania into 10 new counties as the first level of administration was created.  However, the structure was modified in 2010 with the abolishment of counties administrations.  (The counties continue to be used for statistical and reporting purposes, however.[19])  Lithuania is divided into:

Each municipality's government is elected in democratic elections of municipality councils. Initially, the elections took place every three years; constitutional amendments in 2002 extended the tenure to four years. The municipality mayors are elected by municipality councils. Also, municipality councils appoint elders to be in charge of an eldership. Currently it is proposed that both mayors and elders should be elected in direct elections.

Counties were ruled by apskrities viršininkas (officially translated as ""governor"") who was appointed by the central government in Vilnius. Their primary duty was to ensure that the municipalities obey the laws of Lithuania and the constitution. They did not have great powers vested in them, and so it was suggested that 10 counties were too many for Lithuania (the smallest county had only four municipalities).  There were proposals to replace the counties with four or five lands, a new administrative unit, based on the ethnographic regions of Lithuania and centered on the country's five major cities.

On 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished,[19] with counties remaining highest level territorial units of Lithuania.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Lithuania
Vytenis,"Vytenis[a] was Grand Duke of Lithuania from c. 1295 to c. 1316.[1][2] He became the first monarch of the Gediminid dynasty to sustain a long-lasting reign, establishing the dynasty’s continuity and long-term governance of Lithuania. In the early 14th century, his reputation outshone that of Gediminas, who is regarded by modern historians as one of the greatest Lithuanian rulers.[3] The rule of Vytenis was marked by constant warfare in an effort to consolidate the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with the Ruthenians, Masovians, and the Teutonic Order.

Vytenis is mentioned for the first time in 1292 during his father's invasion of Masovia: an army of 800 men reached as far as Łęczyca. During this raid he fought one of the most victorious battles (Battle of Trojanów).[4] After his father's death, c. 1295, he became Grand Duke. Vytenis was soon involved in succession disputes in Poland, supporting Boleslaus II of Masovia, who was married to a Lithuanian duchess Gaudemunda, and opposing Władysław I of Poland.[3] In Ruthenia, Vytenis managed to recapture lands lost after the assassination of Mindaugas and capture the principalities of Pinsk and Turaŭ.[5]

The crusade against pagan Lithuania and Samogitia intensified and reached a new level in the 1290s as Prussians and other Baltic tribes were conquered by the Teutonic Knights and Livonian Order. During Vytenis's reign a network of defensive castles was established and strengthened along the banks of the Neman and Jūra rivers; the Knights matched this with their own castles on the opposite bank.[3] During this time, the Teutonic Order was attempting to establish a corridor along the Baltic Sea, in Samogitia, to link up with the Livonian Order to the north. During the reign of Vytenis, the Teutonic Knights organized some 20 raids into Samogitia.[4] Vytenis took measures to undermine influence of local Samogitian nobles, as evidenced by an increasing numbers of traitors and refugees.[6] It seems that Gediminas was helping Vytenis to control the nobles, who seriously considered resettling in Prussia as vassals of the Teutonic Knights.[7] The Order also consolidated its control over Semigalia, where Lithuanians had their garrisons since the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order captured Dynaburg Castle, controlled by Lithuanians since 1281, in 1313.[5]

One of the most celebrated achievements of Vytenis was an alliance with Riga. In 1297 disagreements between the Archbishop of Riga, burghers of Riga, and the Livonian Order grew into an internal war. Vytenis offered help to the citizens of Riga and even made some vague promises to convert to Christianity, to ease religious tensions between the pagan soldiers and Christian residents.[3] Vytenis successfully invaded Livonia, destroyed Karkus castle north of Riga, and defeated the order in the Battle of Turaida, killing Livonian Land Master Bruno and 22 knights.[4] When Livonia was secured, Vytenis organized eleven campaigns into territories of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia in 1298–1313,[5] including one to Brodnica, where the entire population was massacred.[8] His cause was helped by the fact that in 1308 the Teutonic Knights conquered Pomerania and started its quarrels with Poland.

A Lithuanian garrison, situated in a ""Lithuanian castle"" outside the city, guarded Riga until 1313 when the city residents gave it to the Order and sent the pagans away. Friendship with Riga fostered trade and commerce, and helped to consolidate Lithuanian influence in the Daugava basin, where c. 1307 Polatsk, a major trade post, was annexed by Lithuania.[6] Due to close contacts with Riga Vytenis invited Franciscan friars to maintain a Catholic church in Navahrudak for German merchants in 1312.[3] In the field of religion, it seems that Vytenis laid the groundwork for the creation of the Metropolitanate of Lithuania c. 1316.[3] The metropolitanate was a tool in the competition between Vilnius and Moscow for the religious leadership in Ruthenia.

Vytenis died ca. 1315 without an heir. The circumstances surrounding his death are not known. For a long time Russian historians claimed that he was struck by lightning. However, that was a mistake of a Russian scribe: it was an inadequate translation of Teutonic propaganda that Gediminas killed his master Vytenis and usurped his throne.[4] Vytenis is mentioned for the last time in September 1315 during the unsuccessful Siege of Christmemel, the first castle built by the Teutonic Knights on the right bank of the Neman River. Historians know of only one son of Vytenis, Žvelgutis (Swalegote), who possibly died before his father.[3] Such a situation allowed Gediminas, brother of Vytenis, to become the Grand Duke of Lithuania. During his reign the Grand Duchy became a major military and political power in the Eastern Europe.[3][9]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vytenis
Lithuanian Hound,"The Lithuanian Hound (Lithuanian: Lietuvių skalikas) is a rare, medium-size hunting dog from Lithuania. It is the only dog breed originating from Lithuania and dates back to the medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[3] However, the breed is not recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI).[4]

The Lithuanian Hound has been traditionally used to hunt hare, fox, and boar.  It is believed that it comes from the mixing of bloodhounds with several other hound breeds.[5] Russian zoologist Leonid Pavlovich Sabaneyev claimed that the hounds were most closely related to St. Hubert Hounds and were brought from France in the 15th century.[2] In the 19th century, authors described up to five different local breeds or types of hounds used for hunting in Lithuania.[2]  They differed in size and were used to hunt different animals (for example, smaller type was used to hunt hares, while large dogs known as ogars were used to hunt deer), but they all had black with tan fur.[2][4]

The breed was first mentioned in written sources in 1541 when a forester from Hrodna sued over a stolen hound. The breed was also mentioned in the Statutes of Lithuania (1588).[4] Once a popular breed in Lithuania, the population decreased to 78 individuals after World War II.[6] Thanks to several enthusiasts, the hound was revived and standardized. The provisional standard was established in 1966 and revised in 1983.[2] There were not enough individual dogs left to revive the sub-breeds or types of the hound, therefore breeders settled on a more universal type.[4] The first Lithuanian Hound exhibition was organized in 1981; it had 62 dogs participating.[3] The number of registered and documented dogs reached around 350 in 1987.[5] After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the breed decreased to around 150 individuals by 1998.[7] The decrease in popularity is explained by changing hunting habits: the Lithuanian Hound is best suited for hunting large animals in large open areas, but modern hunting plots are decreasing in size.[7] Due to the small population, inbreeding is a major concern of the breeders. A study in 2008 calculated the coefficient of inbreeding at 2.09% and relatedness at 6.74%.[8]

It is sturdy and heavy-boned, but at the same time sleek and muscular. It has a short black coat with some brown on snout, chest, ears, forehead. The official standard allows for a small white spot on the chest, but not on toes.[7] Fur is thick and short, up to 3–5 centimetres (1.2–2.0 in) in length.[3] The dog's long tail is sword-shaped and naturally low. The head is large, chest is broad, deep and low. Ears are long with rounded tips, and hang close to the cheeks.[7] Neck is quite long and strong with no dewlap. The feet are straight, strong and round, with compact toes, helping it be a fast, very agile, and determined pursuer.[7] The dogs are energetic and need rigorous exercise. They are responsive to training.[1]

In June 2011, during a city festival, a sculpture of the Lithuanian Hound was unveiled in Telšiai. Zigmas Goštautas, who was instrumental in reviving the breed in 1950s, was a resident of Telšiai.[9] In May 2015, a sculpture of three hounds by Rimantas Keturka and Feliksas Volčakas was unveiled near the Vilnius Castle Complex.[3] In 2017, Bank of Lithuania issued a commemorative coin (in 10 and 1.5 euros denominations) that depict two Lithuanian Hounds and a Žemaitukas (a Lithuanian horse breed).[10]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Hound
Władysław Syrokomla,"Ludwik Władysław Franciszek Kondratowicz (29 September 1823 – 15 September 1862), better known as Władysław Syrokomla (Lithuanian: Vladislovas Sirokomlė), was a Polish romantic poet, writer and translator working in Vilnius and Vilna Governorate, then Russian Empire, whose writings were mainly dedicated to the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In his writings, Syrokomla called himself a Lithuanian but was disappointed by his inability to speak the Lithuanian language.[1]

Syrokomla was born on 29 September 1823 in the village of Smolhava [lt; be], in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (now Minsk Region, Belarus), to an impoverished noble family.[2][3][4][5] His parents were Aleksander Kajetan Kondratowicz (d. 1858) and Wiktoria (née Złotkowska).[6] His uncle was Hilary Kondratowicz (1790–1823), a Polish teacher of maths in Vilnius gymnasium, who published some articles in Wiadomości Brukowe [pl].[6][7] A year after his birth his parents moved to another village called Jaskavičy [be].[5] In 1833 he entered the Dominican school in Nyasvizh.[5] He had to give up his studies due to financial problems. In 1837, he began work in a Marchačoŭščyna [pl; be] folwark.[5]

Between 1841 and 1844, he worked as a clerk in the Radziwiłł family land manager's office.[4][5] On 16 April 1844 in Nyasvizh he married Paulina Mitraszewska, with whom he had four children; three of them would die in the same year (1852).[5] Later, Syrokomla had a widely criticised an affair with a married actress Helena Kirkorowa.[8]

In 1844, he published the first of his poems – Pocztylion – under the pen-name Władysław Syrokomla, coined after his family's coat of arms.[4][5] The same year he also rented the small village of Załucze.[4] In 1853, after the death of three of his children, he sold it or gave his manor to his parents, and settled in Vilnius itself.[3][4][5] After a few months he rented the Bareikiškės village, near Vilnius.[5]

He became one of the editors (1861–1862) of the Kurier Wileński, the largest and most prestigious Polish-language daily newspaper published in the Vilnius region.[4] In 1858, he visited Kraków, and some time later he visited Warsaw.[3] For taking part in an anti-tsarist demonstration in 1861 in Warsaw he was arrested by the Okhrana and then sentenced to home arrest in his manor in Bareikiškės.[4][5] He died on 15 September 1862 and was buried in the Rasos Cemetery in Vilnius.[3][5]

Throughout his life, Syrokomla would remain impoverished; Czesław Miłosz wrote that he was ""forever struggling against his lack of education and his poverty"".[5][9] Despite that, Syrokomla had many influential and even wealthy friends; his manor was visited by count Eustachy Tyszkiewicz, Stanisław Moniuszko, Ignacy Chodźko, Mikołaj Malinowski, Antoni Pietkiewicz and others.[5]

Syrkomla was influenced by Adam Mickiewicz.[10] In his prose he supported the liberation of peasants and secession of the lands of former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from Russian Empire, which had annexed portions of the Commonwealth, including what was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, during its late 18th-century partitions.

Among the most notable of Syrokomla's works are translations of various Russian, French, Ukrainian, German and Latin poets, including works by Goethe, Heine, Lermontov, Shevchenko, Nekrasov, Béranger and others. His translations are considered a ""great service"" for the Polish language.[11] Syrokomla also produced a number of works about the rustic nature, people and customs of Lithuania and Belarus.[2][10]

The vast majority of his works were written in the Polish language, however, he also wrote several poems in Belarusian.[9] Syrokomla is considered by some as one of the early influential writers in modern Belarusian language, although many of his Belarusian poems are believed to be lost.[12]

Nevertheless, based on the knowledge of how the small nobility lived in Lithuania in the first half of the 19th century, it is assumed that Syrokomla was bilingual from childhood and was equally fluent in Belarusian and Polish.[citation needed] This is evidenced by the statements of the poet himself, which speak about the knowledge of the Belarusian language and how to master it in everyday contacts with the Belarusian people.[citation needed] He mentioned this in «Teka Wileńska»: ""Karamzin, as a Russian, probably didn't know the old Belarusian dialect as we did, which we learned in everyday relations with the people"".[13][14][15]

The poet was interested in the Belarusian language, introduced it into his works and mentioned it to the readers of the ""Gazeta Warszawska"". He wrote about the Belarusian language and its meaning in the past:[14][15]

This branch of the Slavic language is beautiful... and old! After all, this is the language of our Lithuanian Statute and legislation... it was spoken by three-quarters of ancient Lithuania, ordinary people, the gentry and the lords.

During his lifetime, his works were translated into several languages, including Lithuanian.[16] The composer Tchaikovsky adapted one of his works expressing a sympathetic view of the then-unliberated peasants – The Coral Beads – into a song.[17] He also wrote of the Tatar community in Lithuania and its mosques and of a Jewish bookseller in Vilnius.[18][19]

Some of his works are classified as gawęda (a story-like Polish epic literary genre).[9]

While majority of sources refer to him as a ""Polish poet"", his legacy is best understood in the context of the multicultural Polish-Lithuanian identity.[20] His birthplace was located within the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania,[9] and he referred to himself as a Lithuanian when expressing his identity.[21]

In his book Wycieczki po Litwie w promieniach od Wilna ('Picnics from Vilnius throughout Lithuania') from 1857–1860, Syrokomla wrote the following:[1]

Another village near the manor is called Lelionys [lt]. On Sunday, a slightly more upbeat life buzzed in it. The inn could hear the noise of revelers. Girls and children were running in the street, shouting in Lithuanian. Unfortunately, the Lithuanian language is incomprehensible to us, who write historical poems of Lithuania. The Lithuanian villager turns out to be more civilized than us. In addition to his native Lithuanian language, he understands Polish well and explains it well.[1]

On the right, behind Airėnai, you can see the beautiful Geisiškės manor with a Gothic-style palace, which now belongs to the Giedraičiai dukes. This manor and the adjacent Europe or Eirope manor are former Jesuit properties. These two estates are separated by a beautiful lake with a small stream flowing out of it. Along it there is a dam covered with brambles and a mill. How I wanted to ask the villager something, but he did not understand me and answered with one word ""Nesuprantu"" [I don't understand]. I, a Lithuanian in the land of Lithuanians, couldn't talk to a Lithuanian![1]

Syrokomla also identified himself with the land of modern Belarus and its people.[22] During Syrokomla's burial ceremony, the Lithuanian poet Edvardas Jokūbas Daukša emphasized that while Syrokomla was influenced by Polish culture, he was a Lithuanian poet, closest to Lithuania after Adam Mickiewicz.[5][16] Teofil Lenartowicz wrote a memorial poem on his death referring to him as a ""lirnik Litewski"" (Lithuanian lyricist).[23] His works were often translated into Lithuanian and Belarusian languages.[24]

In modern Belarus, he is being praised for depicting the life of 19th century Belarus and for his ethnographic research of Belarusians.[25] In his publications, Syrokomla supported the Belarusian language and the Belarusian theatre plays by the playwright Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich.[12][26]

In Belarus, there are streets named after W. Syrokomla (vulica Uladzislava Syrakomli) in Minsk, Grodno and in smaller towns Novogrudok, Nyasvizh, Pinsk, Vawkavysk, Maladzyechna and Pruzhany. In Smolhava a school is named after Syrokomla.[24]

In Warsaw's residential district Bródno (city district Warszawa-Targówek) there are two streets dedicated to the poet: Ludwik Kondratowicz St and Władysław Syrokomla St.

In Vilnius, a Polish-language school of the Polish minority in Lithuania is named after him.[24][27]

Wartime collaboration in the Baltic states,"Wartime collaboration occurred in every country occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War, including the Baltic states. The three Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, were occupied by the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, and were later occupied by Germany in the summer of 1941 and then incorporated, together with parts of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union (modern Belarus), into the Reichskommissariat Ostland.[1] Collaborators with Germany participated in the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, as well as in the Holocaust, both in and outside of the Baltic states. This collaboration was done through formal Waffen-SS divisions and police battalions, as well as through spontaneous acts during the opening of the war.

In German plans, Estonia was to become an area for future German settlements, as Estonians themselves were considered high on the Nazi racial scale, with potential for Germanization.[2] Unlike the other Baltic states, the seizure of Estonian territory by German troops was relatively long, from July 7 to December 2, 1941. This period was used by the Soviets to carry out a wave of repression against Estonians. It is estimated that the NKVD's subordinate destruction battalions killed some 2,000 Estonian civilians,[3] and 50–60,000 people were deported deep into the USSR.[4] 10,000 of them died in the GULAG system within a year.[4] Many Estonians fought against Soviet troops on the German side, hoping to liberate their country. Some 12,000 Estonian partisans took part in the fighting.[5] Of great importance were the 57 Finnish-trained members of the Erna group, who operated behind enemy lines.[5]

Resistance groups were organised by Germans in August 1941 into the Omakaitse (lit. 'Self-defence'), which had between 34,000[6] and 40,000 members,[7] mainly based on the Kaitseliit, dissolved by the Soviets.[6] Omakaitse was in charge of clearing the German army's rear of Red Army soldiers, NKVD members, and Communist activists. Within a year its members killed 5,500 Estonian residents.[8] Later, they performed guard duty and fought Soviet partisans flown into Estonia.[8] From among Omakaitse members were recruited Estonian policemen, members of the Estonian Auxiliary Police and officers of the Estonian 20th Waffen-SS Division.[9]

The Germans formed a puppet government, the Estonian Self-Administration, headed by Hjalmar Mäe. This government had considerable autonomy in internal affairs, such as filling police posts.[9] The Security Police in Estonia (SiPo) had a mixed Estonian-German structure (139 Germans and 873 Estonians) and was formally under the Estonian Self-Administration.[10] Estonian police cooperated with Germans in rounding up Jews, Roma, communists and those deemed enemies of existing order or asocial elements. The police also helped to conscript Estonians for forced labor and military service under German command.[11] Most of the small population of Estonian Jews fled  before the Germans arrived, with only about a thousand remaining. All of them were arrested by Estonian police and executed by Omakaitse.[12] Members of the Estonian Auxiliary Police and 20th Waffen-SS Division also executed Jewish prisoners sent to concentration and labor camps established by the Germans on Estonian territory.[13]

Immediately after entering Estonia, the Germans began forming volunteer Estonian units the size of a battalion. By January 1942, six Security Groups (battalions No. 181-186, about 4,000 men) had been formed and were subordinate to the Wehrmacht 18th Army.[14] After the one-year contract expired, some volunteers transferred to the Waffen-SS or returned to civilian life, and three Eastern Battalions (No. 658-660) were formed from those who remained.[14] They fought until early 1944, after which their members transferred to the 20th Waffen-SS Division.[14]

Beginning in September 1941, the SS and police command created four Infantry Defence Battalions (No. 37-40) and a reserve and sapper battalion (No. 41-42), which were operationally subordinate to the Wehrmacht. From 1943 they were called Police Battalions, with 3,000 serving in them.[14] In 1944 they were transformed into two infantry battalions and evacuated to Germany in the fall of 1944, where they were incorporated into the 20th Waffen-SS Division.[14]

In the fall of 1941, the Germans also formed eight police battalions (No. 29-36), of which only Battalion No. 36 had a typically military purpose. However, due to shortages, most of them were sent to the front near Leningrad,[15] and were mostly disbanded in 1943. That same year, the SS and police command created five new Security and Defense Battalions (they inherited No. 29-33 and had more than 2,600 men).[16] In the spring of 1943, five Defence Battalions (No. 286-290) were established as compulsory military service units. The 290th Battalion consisted of Estonian Russians. Battalions No. 286, 288 and 289 were used to fight partisans in Belarus.[17]

On Aug. 28, 1942, the Germans formed the volunteer Estonian Waffen-SS Legion. Of the approximately 1,000 volunteers, 800 were incorporated into Battalion Narva and sent to Ukraine in the spring of 1943.[18] Due to the shrinking number of volunteers, in February 1943 the Germans introduced compulsory conscription in Estonia. Born between 1919 and 1924 faced the choice of going to work in Germany, joining the Waffen-SS or Estonian auxiliary battalions. 5,000 joined the Estonian Waffen-SS Legion, which was reorganized into the 3rd Estonian Waffen-SS Brigade.[17]

As the Red Army advanced, a general mobilization was announced, officially supported by Estonia's last Prime Minister Jüri Uluots. By April 1944, 38,000 Estonians had been drafted. Some went into the 3rd Waffen-SS Brigade, which was enlarged to division size (20th Waffen-SS Division: 10 battalions, more than 15,000 men in the summer of 1944) and also incorporated most of the already existing Estonian units (mostly Eastern Battalions).[19] Younger men were conscripted into other Waffen-SS units. From the rest, six Border Defense Regiments and four Police Fusilier Battalions (Nos. 286, 288, 291, and 292).[20]

The Estonian Security Police and SD,[21] the 286th, 287th and 288th Estonian Auxiliary Police battalions, and 2.5–3% of the Estonian Omakaitse (Home Guard) militia units (between 1,000 and 1,200 men) took part in rounding up, guarding or killing of 400–1,000 Roma and 6,000 Jews in concentration camps in the Pskov region of Russia and the Jägala, Vaivara, Klooga and Lagedi concentration camps in Estonia.

Guarded by these units, 15,000 Soviet POWs died in Estonia: some through neglect and mistreatment and some by execution.[22]

Deportations and murders of Latvians by the Soviet NKVD reached their peak in the days before the capture of Soviet-occupied Riga by German forces.[23] Those that the NKVD could not deport before the Germans arrived were shot at the Central Prison.[23] The RSHA's instructions to their agents to unleash pogroms fell on fertile ground.[23] After the Einsatzkommando 1a and part of Einsatzkommando 2 entered the Latvian capital,[24] Einsatzgruppe A's commander Franz Walter Stahlecker made contact with Viktors Arājs on 1 July and instructed him to set up a commando unit. It was later named Latvian Auxiliary Police or Arajs Kommandos.[25] The members, far-right students and former officers were all volunteers, and free to leave at any time.[25]

The next day, 2 July, Stahlecker instructed Arājs to have the Arājs Kommandos unleash pogroms that looked spontaneous,[23] before the German occupation authorities were properly established.[26]  Einsatzkommando-influenced[27] mobs of former members of Pērkonkrusts and other extreme right-wing groups began pillaging and making mass arrests, and killed 300 to 400 Riga Jews. Killings continued under the supervision of SS Brigadeführer Walter Stahlecker, until more than 2,700 Jews had died.[23][26]

The activities of the Einsatzkommando were constrained after the full establishment of the German occupation authority, after which the SS made use of select units of native recruits.[24] German General Wilhelm Ullersperger and Voldemārs Veiss, a well known Latvian nationalist, appealed to the population in a radio address to attack ""internal enemies"". During the next few months, the Latvian Auxiliary Security Police primarily focused on killing Jews, Communists and Red Army stragglers in Latvia and in neighbouring Byelorussia.[25]

In February–March 1943, eight Latvian battalions took part in the punitive anti-partisan Operation Winterzauber near the Belarus–Latvia border, which resulted in 439 burned villages, 10,000 to 12,000 deaths, and over 7,000 taken for forced labor or imprisoned at the Salaspils concentration camp.[28] This group alone killed almost half of Latvia's Jewish population,[29] about 26,000 Jews, mainly in November and December 1941.[30]

The creation of the Arājs Kommando was ""one of the most significant inventions of the early Holocaust"",[29] and marked a transition from German-organised pogroms to systematic killing of Jews by local volunteers (former army officers, policemen, students, and Aizsargi).[26] This helped with a chronic German personnel shortage and provided the Germans with relief from the psychological stress of routinely murdering civilians.[26] By the autumn of 1941, the SS had deployed the Latvian Auxiliary Police battalions to Leningrad, where they were consolidated into the 2nd Latvian SS Infantry Brigade.[31] In 1943, this brigade, which later became the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), was consolidated with the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian) to become the Latvian Legion.[31] Although the Latvian Legion was a formally volunteer Waffen-SS unit, it was voluntary only in name; approximately 80–85% of its men were conscripts.[32]

Prior to the German invasion, some leaders in Lithuania and in exile believed Germany would grant the country autonomy, as they had the Slovak Republic. The German intelligence service Abwehr believed that it controlled the Lithuanian Activist Front, a pro-German organization based at the Lithuanian embassy in Berlin.[33]  Lithuanians formed the Provisional Government of Lithuania on their own initiative, but Germany did not recognize it diplomatically, or allow Lithuanian ambassador Kazys Škirpa to become prime minister, instead actively thwarting his activities. The provisional government disbanded, since it had no power and it had become clear that the Germans came as occupiers not liberators from Soviet occupation, as initially thought.

Units under Algirdas Klimaitis and supervised by SS Brigadeführer Walter Stahlecker started pogroms in and around Kaunas on 25 June 1941.[34][35] Lithuanian collaborators killed hundreds of thousands of Jews, Poles and Gypsies.[36] According to Lithuanian-American scholar Saulius Sužiedėlis, an  increasingly antisemitic atmosphere clouded Lithuanian society, and antisemitic LAF émigrés ""needed little prodding from 'foreign influences'"".[37] He concluded that Lithuanian collaboration was ""a significant help in facilitating all phases of the genocidal program . . . [and that] the local administration contributed, at times with zeal, to the destruction of Lithuanian Jewry"".[38] Elsewhere, Sužiedėlis similarly emphasised that Lithuania's ""moral and political leadership failed in 1941, and that thousands of Lithuanians participated in the Holocaust"",[39] though he warned that ""[u]ntil buttressed by reliable accounts providing time, place and at least an approximate number of victims, claims of large-scale pogroms before the advent of the German forces must be treated with caution"".[40]

In 1941, the Lithuanian Security Police was created, subordinate to Nazi Germany's Security Police and Criminal Police.[41] Of the 26 Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions, 10 were involved in the Holocaust.[clarification needed] On August 16, the head of the Lithuanian police, Vytautas Reivytis [lt], ordered the arrest of Jewish men and women with Bolshevik activities: ""In reality, it was a sign to kill everyone.""[42] The Special SD and German Security Police Squad in Vilnius killed 70,000 Jews in Paneriai and other places.[41][clarification needed] In Minsk, the 2nd Battalion shot about 9,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and in Slutsk it massacred 5,000 Jews.

In March 1942, in Poland, the 2nd Lithuanian Battalion guarded the Majdanek concentration camp.[43] In July 1942, the 2nd Battalion participated in the deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp.[44] In August–October 1942, some of the Lithuanian police battalions were in Belarus and Ukraine: the 3rd in Molodechno, the 4th in Donetsk, the 7th in Vinnytsa, the 11th in Korosten, the 16th in Dnepropetrovsk, the 254th in Poltava and the 255th in Mogilev (Belarus).[45][unreliable source?] One battalion was also used to put down the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.[43]

The participation of the local populace was a key factor in the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania[46] which resulted in the near total decimation of Lithuanian Jews living in the Nazi-occupied Lithuanian territories that would. From 25 July 1941, participation was under the Generalbezirk Litauen of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Out of approximately 210,000[47] Jews, (208,000 according to the Lithuanian pre-war statistical data)[48] an estimated 195,000–196,000 perished before the end of World War II (wider estimates are sometimes published); most from June to December 1941.[47][49] The events happening in the USSR's western regions occupied by Nazi Germany in the first weeks after the German invasion (including Lithuania – see map) marked the sharp intensification of the Holocaust.[50][51][52]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_collaboration_in_the_Baltic_states

Palemonids,"The Palemonids (Lithuanian: Palemono dinastija) were a legendary dynasty of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The legend was born in the 15th or 16th century as proof that Lithuanians and the Grand Duchy were of Roman origins.

Jan Długosz (1415–1480) wrote that the Lithuanians were of Roman origin, but did not provide any proof. The legend is first recorded in the second edition of the Lithuanian Chronicles produced in the 1530s.[1] At the time the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was quarrelling with the Kingdom of Poland, rejecting the claims that Poland had civilized the pagan and barbaric Lithuania. The Lithuanian nobility felt a need for the ruling dynasty to show upstanding origins, as the only available chronicles at the time were written by the Teutonic Knights, a long-standing enemy, and depicted Gediminas, ancestor of the Gediminids dynasty, as a hostler of Vytenis.[2]

In this new Lithuanian chronicle, Palemon (sometimes identified as Polemon II of Pontus), a relative of Roman emperor Nero, escaped Rome together with 500 noble families. The company traveled north, through the Baltic Sea, and reached the Nemunas Delta. After that they decided to sail upstream until they reached the mouth of Dubysa. There, the Palemonids settled on a large hill (now known as the Palemon Hill [lt]) and ruled the country for generations until the Gediminids emerged.[1] The chronicle skipped Mindaugas and Traidenis, attested Grand Dukes of Lithuania, entirely.[2] It incorporated the account of the Gediminid line from the first edition. To make the story more believable, the chronicler presented a very detailed account of the journey. Because there were not enough generations to cover the gap between the 1st century when Palemon arrived and the 14th century when Gediminas died, the third edition of the chronicle, also known as the Bychowiec Chronicle, placed Palemon in the 5th century instead of the 1st, when Rome was devastated by Attila the Hun,[1] and included Mindaugas and other attested dukes. But it was not enough and historians like Maciej Stryjkowski and Kazimierz Kojałowicz-Wijuk [lt] moved the account further, into the 10th century.[3] Multiple contradictory versions of the legend survive to this day as historians tried to patch up some obvious mistakes and make it more historically sound.

The first to critically evaluate and reject the legend was historian Joachim Lelewel in 1839.[4] At the end of the 19th century there were some attempts, for example in a history written by Maironis, to tie the legend with the expansion of the Vikings.[1] While many historians up until the dawn of the 20th century believed the legend to be true, it is now largely discarded as a fictional story that only serves to illustrate political ideology in the 16th-century Lithuania.[5]

Princely houses of Poland and Lithuania,"The princely houses of Poland and Lithuania differed from other princely houses in Europe. The Polish and Lithuanian nobility (szlachta) could not be granted noble titles by the King in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as hereditary titles, with some exceptions, were largely forbidden. Therefore, the title of prince either dated to the times before the Union of Lublin, which created the Commonwealth in 1569, or was granted to some nobles (usually magnates) by foreign kings. Due to the longstanding history of common statehood, some noble families often described as ""Polish"" actually originated in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and are of Lithuanian or Ruthenian descent.

These princely houses lived like average rich nobility, but sometimes part of these lived like peasants.[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_houses_of_Poland_and_Lithuania

National Alliance (Lithuania),"The National Alliance (Lithuanian: Nacionalinis susivienijimas, NS) is a Lithuanian far-right political party founded on 7 March 2020 and led by philosopher Vytautas Radžvilas.[6] As of 2024, the party holds two municipal council seats and one seat in Seimas, being represented by its vice-chairman Vytautas Sinica.[7]

The predecessor to the party was the Vilnius Forum, later the National Forum, a right-wing political movement which criticized globalization, liberalism and LGBT rights, founded in 2016.[8] The founder of the Forum was Vytautas Radžvilas, a political philosopher, professor and former activist of the Sąjūdis during the Singing Revolution, known for his criticism of liberalism and multiple citizenship, as well as Eurosceptic views.[9] During this period, he gained notoriety for a conflict with the administration of Vilnius University, and he claimed he was removed from lecturing in the university's politics and international relations institute because of his right-wing views.[10]

In 2019, Radžvilas established the public election committee ""Vytautas Radžvilas: Recover the State!"" (Lithuanian: Vytautas Radžvilas: susigrąžinkime valstybę!) to participate in the 2019 European Parliament election in Lithuania. Though he claimed that the European Parliament is powerless, he likened it to the Congress of the People's Deputies in the last years of the Soviet Union, and that it will determine the future of the organization.[11] The committee received 3.35 percent of the votes and did not win any seats.[12]

After the election, the movement considered unification with 2019 presidential candidate Arvydas Juozaitis and the Christian Union, but it failed due to personal conflict and a separate National Alliance was founded on 7 March 2020.[13] It received 2.21 percent of the vote in the 2020 parliamentary election, and received no seats in the Seimas.[14]

In 2021, the party received personal thanks from Viktor Orban for their endorsement of Hungarian anti-LGBT laws.[15]

Most of the party's votes came from Vilnius. According to political scientist Matas Baltrukevičius, it represents the same electorate as the Lithuanian List, a short-lived anti-establishment party which was founded in 2012 and represented in the municipal council of Vilnius from 2015 to 2019.[16]

In the 2023 municipal elections, it won three seats on the municipal council of Vilnius City Municipality, its most successful election result. One of the party's councillors, Aleksandras Nemunaitis, was expelled in April 2023, as he joined the effort to nominate Artūras Zuokas as leader of the opposition in the Vilnius municipal council, even though the party opposed this move.[17]

In the 2024 Lithuanian parliamentary election, the party gained representation, when party's deputy leader Vytautas Sinica won a single member constituency in Vilnius.[18]

The National Alliance is generally described as a far-right[15][19] party. It claims to be an all-national movement that seeks to restore the ideas of Sąjūdis, the national movement which was responsible for the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990.[20] The party is described as nationalist, with a dream to make ""Lithuania forever Lithuanian.""[3][21]

It claims to represent a nationalist,[2] socially conservative, Christian worldview, opposes European integration and legalization of multiple citizenship, and demands lustration of all former informants of the KGB.[22] The party's primary objective is opposition to the national strategy of ""Global Lithuania"", which seeks to maintain the Lithuanian diaspora as an integral part of a ""global"" Lithuanian state, and demands a strategy towards limiting emigration and encouraging emigrant return. It is also opposed to LGBT rights and states that its purpose is to defend Christianity in Lithuania and Lithuanian ethnicity from extinction.[23]

Economically, the party holds certain populist and interventionist views, such as instituting progressive taxation, strengthening the social safety net and increasing funding for the education system, although it also seeks to ""destroy the mentality of dependency"" and cut benefits for certain social groups, such as alcoholics, unemployed persons and single mothers whose children's father's identity is unknown.[24]

It does not seek Lithuania's withdrawal from the European Union, but opposes further integration and demands more powers to be returned to the organization's member states. It also demands that the European Union formally recognize its Christian heritage.[25]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Alliance_(Lithuania)
Lithuanian Land Forces,"The Lithuanian Land Forces (LLF) form the backbone of the Lithuanian Armed Forces and are capable of acting as an integral part of NATO forces. Lithuanian Land Forces consist of a single recently formed 1st Army Division, the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces, and supporting units, together comprising over 22,000 soldiers.

The main element of the Land Forces is the 1st Army Division, comprising the Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade, The ""Žemaitija"" (Griffin) infantry brigade, and the ""Aukštaitija"" infantry brigade.

The Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade is the main element of the Division and is formed around three mechanized infantry battalions and an artillery battalion, all named after Lithuanian grand dukes as the tradition of the Lithuanian Armed Forces goes.

The ""Žemaitija"" (Griffin) brigade was activated on 1 January 2016.[2] It is composed of three motorised infantry battalions and one artillery battalion; one of these is tasked to support operations both domestically and overseas; one is tasked primarily with the defence of territorial Lithuania.

The Brigade ""Aukštaitija"" is a reserve brigade, which was activated on 23 March 2017. In peacetime the brigade's headquarter staff works at the Lithuanian Armed Forces Training and Doctrine Command. The brigade's three maneuver battalions are made up of reservists, while the three battalion's headquarters personnel works in peacetime at the Division General Stasys Raštikis Lithuanian Armed Forces School, Great Lithuanian Hetman Jonušas Radvila Training Regiment, and General Adolfas Ramanauskas Combat Training Center. The brigade's reconnaissance company is composed of conscripts, while the brigade's headquarters, signal and logistic units are composed of professional soldiers. When activated the brigade consists of around 4,500 troops.

Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion is responsible for mine clearance, the construction of pontoon bridges, unexploded ordnance detonation tasks, underwater engineering, and participation in search and rescue operations. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Platoon is ready to participate in international operations. Starting in 2008, the Lithuanian Armed Forces launched a 10-year-long project continuing mine cleaning on Lithuanian territory of explosives left after the First and Second World War, and in former Soviet military bases.

As an integral part of the Land Forces, the National Defence Volunteers have been developing since the beginning of the national movement for independence. The volunteers act smoothly together with the Allies during military operations and have been assigned new missions: to augment the regular forces, to deploy individual units and specific capabilities for international operations, to assist host nation support and to support the civilian authorities.

With the reintroduction of conscription in 2015 the Lithuanian Land Force began an expansion of its main combat formations. As of January 2025 the land forces consist of the following units:

In reforming the Armed Forces, most of the available attention and financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces. Lithuania has been modernizing its armed forces since 1990s and by now nearly all equipment is compatible with the NATO standards. The current efforts focus on increasing the firepower, acquiring new equipment and armaments, enhancing their operational effectiveness and combat training. The standard service assault rifle of the Lithuanian Armed Forces is the Heckler & Koch G36 and the standard pistol is the Glock 17. The Lithuanian Land Forces are also equipped with machine guns, including the GPMG MG-3, the FN MAG, and the 12.7mm (.50 cal.) M2 Browning machine gun. They also employ the AT-4 anti-tank rockets and Carl Gustav anti-tank recoilless rifles, HK GMG high-velocity grenade launchers, and low-velocity AG-36 under-the-barrel grenade launchers, in addition to light and heavy mortars. The army also uses high-technology Lithuanian-made tactical automated commanding and controlling informational systems (TAVVIS).

Conscription in Lithuania lasts 9 months. Every year a random list of 18-23-year-old men are called up to fill the 3,500 draftee requirement, however men and women up to 38 years old can apply voluntarily. In practice, only a small fraction of the conscripts need to be drafted, as the vast majority apply and serve voluntarily.[7] After completing the 9 months service, conscripts are added to the active military reserve, where they remain for 10 years and are periodically called up to refresh their skills.[8]

Conscription halted in Lithuanian in 2008, as the military focused on developing the professional armed forces, and the relative geopolitical stability coupled with economic crisis didn't justify the increased spending.[9]

Conscription was eventually reintroduced in 2015, this decision was determined by two main reasons: changed geopolitical situation and insufficient manning of the units of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The first draft included 3,000 people, with plans to raise it to 3,500 the following year.[10]

The deteriorating geopolitical state in 2022 reignited the debate over importance of conscription, and as of 2025 there are numerous reforms planned with the eventual goal of universal mandatory conscription. A new law will take effect starting 2026 that will, among other things, raise the quantity of enlisted conscripts from 3,500 to 4,000, change the draft pool to include all high-school graduates from 18 to 22 years old, and offer more alternative forms of service.[11]

Sophia of Lithuania,"Sophia Vitovtovna of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Sofija Vytautaitė, Russian: Софья Витовтовна, romanized: Sofya Vitovtovna; 1371 – 1453) was the grand princess of Moscow as the wife of Vasily I from 1391 to 1425. She was regent for her son Vasily II from 1425 to 1432.[1] Her father was Vytautas, the grand duke of Lithuania.

She was the daughter of Vytautas the Great of Lithuania and his first wife, Anna. On 21 January 1391, while her father was engaged in the Lithuanian Civil War, she married Vasili I of Moscow. She was the longest serving consort of Russia.

After Vasili's death in 1425 she became regent for their ten-year-old son Vasili II. Her father supported Vasili's claim to the throne, which was disputed by his uncle, Yuri of Zvenigorod.

Sophia was buried in the Ascension Convent; the sarcophagus was moved in 1929 to the Cathedral of the Archangel by Soviet authorities.[2]

She and Vasili I had at least nine children, five boys (of which only one survived to mature adulthood) and four girls:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Lithuania
Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission,"The Provisional Government Commission of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; also, the Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission (Lithuanian: Lietuvos laikinosios vyriausybės komisija; also Lietuvos Didžiosios Kunigaikštystės vyriausybės komisija, Polish: Komisja Rządu Tymczasowego Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego; also Komisja Rządząca Tymczasowa Litewska; French: Gouvernement provisoire de Lituanie; also Gouvernement général de la Lituanie) was a provisional administrative body for Lithuania, which had been overtaken by Napoleon's Grand Army during the 1812 French invasion of Russia.[1] On 14 July 1812 the Commission formally joined the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, creating the united Kingdom of Poland.

The commission was established on 1 July 1812 by order of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.[2] Its chief tasks included the creation of Lithuanian armed forces, and the provisioning of Napoleon's troops.[2] The governotes (later changed to ""departments"") of Vilnius, Grodno, Minsk and Białystok were attached to the jurisdiction of the government of Lithuania.

Central, regional and local bodies of the civil administration of the 4 provinces were subordinated to him. Departments were divided into divisions headed by sub-prefects. In each of them, and later in the Vitebsk and Mogilev departments (not subordinate to the government, subordinate to the military governor Charpentier), an administrative commission of 3 members, appointed or approved by Napoleon, was organized under the chairmanship of the French quartermaster. 
The structure of municipal (city) self-government was organized according to the example of Vilnius. At the same time, a system of military-administrative management of the region was created. 
The bodies of the Napoleonic administration were mainly involved in the organization of armed formations, provision of troops, and collection of funds.[2]

The Provisional Government of Lithuania, initially, had no connections to Poland.[3]

Supervision of the commission was entrusted to the former French Resident in the Duchy of Warsaw, Commissioner Louis Pierre Édouard Bignon. Actual power, however, was exercised by Dutch General Dirk van Hogendorp, former governor of Java, who was appointed governor of Vilnius.

Napoleon, contrary to the hopes reposed in him by the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, had not restored Polish statehood to the former Polish–Lithuanian lands.  He had merely established, in the conquered territories, a provisional administration, thereby sidestepping final dispositions pending his further conquest of Russia.

Józef Wybicki, sent on 11 July 1812 to Vilnius with a deputation from the Council of the General Confederation, unsuccessfully attempted to get the Emperor to declare the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, including the territories that had been annexed in the Partitions of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Napoleon also refused to attach the military units consisting of Lithuanians to the Polish ones.

Only on 14 July 1812 the Commission formally joined the General Confederation of the Kingdom of Poland, creating the united Kingdom of Poland.

After Russian troops invaded Lithuanian territory at the end of 1812, the Commission acted outside Lithuania.

Alfredas Bumblauskas,"Alfredas Bumblauskas (born 18 November 1956) is a professor at Vilnius University and one of the best known Lithuanian historians, specializing in the research of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1]

After graduating from Žemaitė school in Telšiai, he enrolled in Vilnius University in 1974. Bumblauskas received his doctoral degree in 1987, and was mentored by Edvardas Gudavičius. He was formerly dean of the Faculty of History and now heads the Department of Theory of History and Cultural History at Vilnius University.[1] He has sponsored and participated in several TV shows about history and culture (e.g. Būtovės slėpiniai with Edvardas Gudavičius).[1] Bumblauskas has been a visiting scholar at the University of Helsinki, the University of Graz, and the University of Warsaw, and is a member of the editorial board of the Przegląd Wschodni.

He is the author of Senosios Lietuvos istorija 1009–1795 (A History of Old Lithuania: 1009–1795) published in Vilnius in 2005.[1]

In 2014, Bumblauskas claimed that the relations with the Belarusians should be reconsidered (e.g. by establishing counterpropaganda institutions) because of what he called was Belarusian appropriation of the history of Lithuania.[2] Bumblauskas also stressed that Algirdas was the creator of the Lithuanian empire who annexed large parts of modern-day Belarus and Ukraine.[2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredas_Bumblauskas

Lithuanian Metrica,"The Lithuanian Metrica or the Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Latin: Acta Magni Ducatus Lithuaniae,  Lithuanian: Lietuvos Metrika, or Lietuvos didžiosios kunigaikštystės metrika; Polish: Metryka Litewska, or Metryka Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego; Belarusian: Літоўская Метрыка, Ukrainian: Литовська метрика) is a collection of the 14–18th-century legal documents of the Chancellery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (GDL). Maintained systematically since the 2nd half of the 15th century, metrica consisted, initially and primarily, of the copies of the documents issued by the Grand Duke, Lithuanian Council of Lords, and Seimas.

The Metrica also included some important externally originated documents (like translations of the issues (yarlyks) of the Crimea Khans, copies of the Muscovy diplomatic documents etc.), the office-keeping documental materials (like registers of acts, inventories of the Metrica itself etc.) The selection of the classes of the documents included in the Metrica had increased since the 2nd half 15th – 16th century and even more so in the 17–18th centuries, extending to include the copies of transcripts of diplomatic correspondence, charters of privileges, wills, verdicts, judicial decrees, even certain kinds of private correspondence, e.g., received by the official persons. Sometimes, the external and thematically not quite related collections of the documents had also been referred to as the part of the Metrica, the word Metrica here to be understood as the State Archive.[1] The documents of the Metrica were to be preserved interminably.

Effectively, the Metrica had become the core of the Archive of the Grand Duke, later the core of the Main State Archive of the GDL, serving the notifying (judicial-registrative), judicial, referential functions. It had been the source of the authoritative official documents (copies of copies). The Metrica developed parallel to and on the model of the Crown Metrica of Poland.

Today, over 600 (estimated) books of the Lithuanian Metrica still exist. Their microfilms are preserved at the Lithuanian State Historical Archives in Vilnius.[2]

The word metrica generates from Polish: metryka for archive, from Latin: matricula for office book.

The first historical names of the collection were metrics, books of metrica, metrica. Since the end of the 16th – beginning of the 17th century, the full official name was Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. This would be the most appropriate scientific name.[1] The dub Lithuanian Metrica had been occasionally used in the local office books (by analogy with the Crown Metrica of Poland), since the mid-17th century the dub had consolidated its position in the documents of the Warsaw Archives, later in the Archives of Moscow and St. Petersburg, then in the 19–20th centuries Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian historiographies. The name Lithuanian Metrica is till now traditionally used in the Western publications of the Metrica.
The name Lithuanian Metrica is also used in reference to some contemporary archival collections, including some of the materials of the Chancellery of the GDL (together with other unrelated materials), chiefly in Russia custody.[1]

The prevailing language of the documents of the 15th and most of the 16th century Metrica had been the Ruthenian language. Alternatively, the prevailing use of the Ruthenian language in the Metrica is extended up to the mid-17th century. The documents, concerned with the Western Europe, had been issued in Latin, occasionally in German. The documents, concerned with the Roman Catholic Church, had been issued in Latin.[3] See also naming of the Ruthenian language.

Since the late 16th – early 17th century, the number of the documents composed in Polish and in Latin, had been steadily increasing, until the complete elimination of the Ruthenian from the office use in the GDL, and further official ban on the Ruthenian for the official use (1696). The language of the 17–18th century Metrica is mostly Polish and partly Latin.

State archives were begun in the 13th-century Kingdom of Lithuania.[4] Diplomacy was greatly increased under the rule of Gediminas. During the various wars, floods, and city fires that followed, many official documents were lost. Some were  impossible to trace,  if these documents had not been duplicated or otherwise copied. A growing need to reproduce these documents later, and the mounting number of edicts, wills, court verdicts etc., determined the evolution of the Lithuanian Metrica.

The Lithuanian Metrica was stored in the Trakai Island Castle under the supervision of the Treasurer, until 1511.  Afterwards the documents were transferred to Vilnius, and kept in what was referred to as the Lower Castle. The responsibility for safeguarding the Metrica there, was supervised by the State Chancellor. By 1569, when the regions of Podlasie, Volhynia, Podolia and the Kiev were separated from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and incorporated into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, the books which concerned these regions, were removed from the Lithuanian Metrica, and merged into the Crown Metrica. Due to the deterioration of the books, the State Grand Chancellor, Lew Sapieha, ordered the volumes of the Metrica to be recopied in 1594. The recopying process continued until 1607. The newly recopied books were  inventoried, rechecked, and transferred to a separate building in Vilnius, with the older books remaining in the Castle of Vilnius.[5]

Great parts of the Metrica  were lost during the wars with Muscovy, and others were taken way by Swedish armies in 1656–1657. Only after the Treaty of Oliva (1660), did the Swedes return many books from the Metrica, but some of them were lost at sea, in the Baltic, during transport back to Lithuania.

The Metrica from Vilnius was taken to Warsaw in 1765.[6] The books were bound, cataloged and integrated into the system that was in use, in Warsaw. According to an edict issued in 1793, the Lithuanian Metrica was to be transferred from Warsaw to Vilnius again. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the  Lithuanian Metrica was transferred from Warsow to Russia as a war trophy and was kept in Saint Petersburg. Russia gave several of the Lithuanian Metrica books to Prussia in 1799.  Afterwards Prussia transferred these books to the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. The remaining Lithuanian Metrica books in St. Petersburg were inventoried and taken to Moscow. The majority of the historical Lithuanian Metrica's books have been kept in Russia, and today only a small fraction of them are in Lithuania.

The remaining part of the Lithuanian Metrica is kept in Poland, at the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw.

The Metrica is one of the most authoritative and revered sources on the history of the GDL. Some of the documents of the Metrica and parts of them had begun to be published in the end 18th century. Larger collections of the materials had begun to be published since 1830s («Digest of Prince Obolyenskiy», altern. «Ambassador’s Book of the Metrica...», in 3 volumes, includes detailed register of the books of the Metrica by Anastasyevich (1817)). Other notable publishers of the Metrica materials had been Lyeontovich, Prohaska, Bershadskiy and others. Other notable publications of the period:

In 1980s–1990s there had begun a new wave of the publishing of the Metrica materials, this time as an international, Belarusian–Lithuanian–Polish–Russian effort.

The Metrica had served as a basis for the works of the notable researchers of the GDL history, e.g., Lyubavskiy, Dovnar-Zapol’skiy, Maksimeyka, Lappo, Pichyeta, Malinovskiy, Lawmyanski and others.

The scientific research of the Metrica itself had begun with the work of Ptaszycki (1887). Other notable researchers of the Metrica: Byeryezhkov, Grimstead, Sułkowska-Kurasiowa.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Metrica
Lithuanian Catholic Academy of Science,"Lithuanian Catholic Academy of Science (Lithuanian: Lietuvių katalikų mokslo akademija or LKMA) is an academic organization (academy of sciences) established in 1922 in Kaunas, Lithuania. It unites Catholic scientists from various fields, from humanities to astrophysics, and promotes academic research, organizes academic conferences (including general conference every three years), publishes academic literature. Its most active section is devoted to history, and in particular to the history of the Catholic Church in Lithuania. Other active sections include those devoted to humanities, education, and medicine. In 1922–2008, LKMA elected a total of 60 true academic members. Its main academic journals are LKMA suvažiavimo darbai (Works of LKMA Conferences), LKMA metraštis (LKMA Chronicle), and Bažnyčios istorijos studijos (Studies of the History of the Church).

During the interwar years, it was most active in providing scholarships to students, organizing three general conferences in 1933, 1936, and 1939, and compiling a biographical dictionary (unpublished). It was abolished in 1940 after the Soviet occupation. As many Lithuanian intellectuals fled abroad in 1944, LKMA was reestablished in Rome in 1956. Twelve local chapters were organized in United States, Canada, and Germany. LKMA resumed organizing general conferences every three years and began publishing academic monographs and journals – a total of 52 publications. In 1973, it took over the American Lithuanian Cultural Archives (ALKA) in Putnam, Connecticut. LKMA was reestablished in Lithuania in 1990 and officially moved its headquarters to Vilnius in 1992. It officially joined the Pax Romana federation in 1993. LKMA continues to organize various conferences and publish academic monographs and journals – approximately 130 publications were published between 1990 and 2020.

Various Russification policies were relaxed in 1904 and Lithuanian clergy organized societies Saulė in Kovno Governorate, Žiburys in the Suwałki Governorate, and Rytas in the Vilna Governorate to fund and operate Lithuanian schools.[1] In 1907, Pope Pius X published encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis in which, among other things, he announced the establishment of the International Catholic Scientific Association.[2] Lithuanian clergy, in particular Pranciškus Būčys and Adomas Dambrauskas-Jakštas, discussed in Draugija whether to join this new organization with the Lithuanian Scientific Society or to establish a separate Catholic organization.[3] However, the International Catholic Scientific Association never materialized[2] and Lithuanian plans were postponed due to World War I to 1922. The University of Lithuania with a Faculty of Theology and Philosophy was established in February 1922.[4] LKMA registered its charter on 12 August 1922 and called the founding meeting on 22 October 1922.[5] The meeting elected its first board: chairman Juozapas Skvireckas, vice-chairmen Pranas Dovydaitis and Stasys Šalkauskis, secretary Mečislovas Reinys.[5]

By 1924, LKMA had 60 members who organized private gatherings two or three times a year.[5] Initially, the academy focused on supporting gifted Lithuanian students. Its scholarship fund was established with a donation of $42,500 (equivalent to $798,375 in 2024) from the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Federation of America [lt].[6] It was later replenished by repayments by former scholarship recipients of the Motinėlė Society. Among the supported students were Juozas Ambrazevičius-Brazaitis, Pranas Dielininkaitis [lt], Zenonas Ivinskis, Antanas Maceina, Antanas Salys [lt], Antanas Vaičiulaitis, Adolfas Damušis [lt], Juozas Girnius, Stasys Antanas Bačkis.[5] LKMA received another approximately $50,000 that was collected from Lithuanian Americans in hopes of establishing a Catholic university.[7]

LKMA organized a library. Though plans to merge it with the libraries of the Kaunas Priest Seminary and of the Archdiocese of Kaunas were not realized, the library contained 12,000 volumes by 1940.[8] In 1927, Dambrauskas-Jakštas initiated the compilation of a biographical dictionary of famous Lithuanians, regardless of religious or political beliefs. In total, 2,638 biographies or five volumes were prepared, but they were not published due to the Soviet occupation.[8] Only one volume Užgesę žiburiai (Extinguished Lights), edited by Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, with 22 biographies of Lithuanians and 14 biographies of non-Lithuanians, was published in 1930.[9] LKMA collaborated in preparing Lietuviškoji enciklopedija, the first Lithuanian encyclopedia.[9] Starting in 1924, LKMA members organized public lectures and later published their texts in Catholic-minded periodicals.[8] Overall, the academy was not very active in the 1920s as many of its members worked at or were involved with other Catholic organizations, including the Priest Seminary and the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy.[8]

LKMA became more active in the 1930s when the authoritarian regime of President Antanas Smetona and his Lithuanian Nationalist Union began suppressing its opponents, including the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and other Catholic groups. Among other things, the government dismissed 18 professors from the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy in 1931[10] and blocked plans for a Catholic university in 1932.[11][12] LKMA began the process of separating amateur science enthusiasts from professional academics and started organizing its conferences every three years. They took place in 1933, 1936, and 1939, featured 26–31 presentations, and were attended by 300–550 people.[13] The conferences were accompanied by exhibitions, concerts, tributes to famous Lithuanians (such as Maironis or Vaižgantas).[13] During the conference, academics worked in various specialized sections (such as history, law, literature and art, medicine) with hopes that these sections would grow into separate institutes.[14] A women's section was organized during the first and the second conferences.[15]

LKMA was disestablished on 10 August 1940, a month after the Soviet occupation, and its property transferred to the Ministry of Education.[16] In 1944, many prominent Lithuanian intellectuals retreated west ahead of the approaching Red Army. They reestablished many Lithuanian organizations and publications. The idea of reestablishing LKMA was first proposed by Stasys Antanas Bačkis in June 1952.[17] He suggested to base the academy in Rome where Lithuanians already had the College of St. Casimir. He was supported by historian Zenonas Ivinskis and priest Antanas Liuima [lt], professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University.[17] The reestablishment of LKMA was officially announced on 16 February 1955. Its board was elected in January 1956 and the academy was officially registered with the Italian authorities on 9 October 1956.[17] Liuima became an ideological leader and long-term chairman of LKMA. The academy organized chapters where at least five LKMA members lived.[18] The first such chapter was organized in Chicago based on a Lithuanian scientific study club.[19] In total, there were twelve chapters: Chicago (established in 1956), New York (1962), Boston (1963), Detroit (1964), Montreal (1964), Toronto (1964), Dayton (1965), Munich (1966), Ottawa (1970), Putnam (1971), St. Pete Beach (1981), Los Angeles (1983).[20]

The academy resumed organizing its conferences, held every three years in different locations in Europe and North America.[21] The conferences struggled to reconcile LKMA's academic mission and the need to engage and educate the wider Lithuanian diaspora.[22] The conferences were also cultural events – they were accompanied by exhibitions (e.g. of historical maps of Lithuanian, philately, numismatics), concerts, commemorations of historical anniversaries (e.g. 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian press ban, 550th anniversary of the Diocese of Samogitia, 400th anniversary of Vilnius University).[23] As during pre-war conferences, academics worked in various sections, including language and literature, art and architecture, medicine. The largest and most active was the history section. Other larger sections were devoted to philosophy and theology.[24] The history section organized three public events to commemorate the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, book smuggler Petras Kriaučiūnas, and poet Antanas Baranauskas.[24]

LKMA published a total of 52 publications,[25] including six biographies (including of bishops Teofilius Matulionis and Vincentas Borisevičius), monographs on the history of the church in Lithuania (on the foundation of the Vilnius University, on the worship of Mary, mother of Jesus in Lithuania), studies on Lithuanian literature, and collected works of historians Zenonas Ivinskis and Konstantinas Avižonis [lt], linguist Antanas Salys [lt], philosopher Stasys Šalkauskis.[9] The academy published four volumes of Fontes Historiae Lithuanie – a valuable collection of primary documents related to ad limina visits of Lithuanian bishops and to the Diocese of Samogitia.[26] It published eleven volumes of works presented at its conferences in LKMA suvažiavimo darbai (Works of LKMA Conferences). In total, these volumes contained 209 academic articles by 131 authors (among them, 12 women).[27] The articles were published on various topics, not only on theology or Lithuanian language and history, but also on chemistry, medicine, sociology, technology, archaeology, etc. Other articles were biographies or obituaries of famous Lithuanians.[28] In addition, the academy published six volumes of LKMA metraštis (LKMA Chronicle) in 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1984. In total, the Chronicle contained 22 articles (19 of them on history) and 15 obituaries.[26] Most of these publications were initiated, proofread, and edited by the long-term chairman of LKMA priest Antanas Liuima [lt].[29] Members of LKMA actively participated in the publication of the 35-volume Lietuvių enciklopedija published in Boston.[29]

In 1958, LKMA organized a commission to publish popular religious literature, but when the plan failed priest Vytautas Balčiūnas organized the publication of the Krikščionis gyvenime (A Christian in Life) series. In 1974, LKMA took over the series.[30] In total, 28 volumes were published. LKMA cared to preserve various Lithuanian archives. In 1973, it took over the American Lithuanian Cultural Archives (ALKA) in Putnam, Connecticut and reconstructed its premises in 1978–1980. Separately it acquired and preserved archives of Zenonas Ivinskis, Stasys Raštikis, Lithuanian student societies at the Swiss University of Fribourg.[30] Even though many members of LKMA were active in various international organizations, LKMA did not join any of them.[23][31]

The idea to reestablish LKMA in Lithuania was raised in November 1989 during the organizational conference of the Catholic Youth Federation Ateitis.[23] Priest Jonas Boruta [lt] was one of the most active advocates for the reestablishment. Already in February 1990, even before Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union, LKMA organized a meeting at Vilnius University attended by 250 people. Its statute was registered with the Lithuanian authorities on 8 May 1990.[32] Its next conference was held in Vilnius in 1991, but it was attended by very few LKMA members from abroad.[33] The organization officially returned to Lithuania in 1992 when it elected a new board from members living in Lithuania.[32] It officially joined the Pax Romana federation in 1993 and the Commission Internationale d'Histoire Ecclésiastique Comparée (CIHEC) in 2011.[34]

LKMA continued the tradition of local chapters, this time established in various Lithuanian cities, but only Vilnius, Klaipėda, and Šiauliai chapters were more active.[35] Most active LKMA sections were those devoted to history, humanities, education, and medicine. The history section published a comprehensive collective monograph on the history of the Catholic Church in Lithuania in 2006.[36] The humanities section established a separate institute under LKMA in 2007. The medicine section helped to popularize the updated Hippocratic Oath among Lithuanian doctors.[37] After a critical evaluation of its mission and situation in 2010, LKMA decided to concentrate on humanities and in particular on the studies of the Catholic Church in Lithuania – in essence abandoning claims that it is an academy of science and recognizing that it became a more specialized research institute.[38]

LKMA continues to publish academic journals and separate monographs. It continues to publish papers presented in its general conferences in LKMA suvažiavimo darbai. It reestablished LKMA metraštis which is published regularly every year.[34] The history section established Bažnyčios istorijos studijos (Studies of the History of the Church) and published 8 volumes by 2016. It also continues the publication of primary documents in the Fontes Historiae Lithuanie series.[34] In total, as of 2008, LKMA published 154 works.[39]

In addition to its general conferences held every three years, LKMA also organizes various specialized academic conferences. For example, it held a conference on Lithuanian–Jewish relations in 1998, bishop Motiejus Valančius in 2001, Polish philosopher Marian Zdziechowski in 2008, Saint Bruno of Querfurt in 2009.[40] Until 2008, LKMA maintained a library in Kaunas. It was liquidated when the Archdiocese of Kaunas terminated the lease of the premises with the Vytautas Magnus University. Part of the collection was transferred to the university, while the rest was transferred to the headquarters in Vilnius.[36] Since 2003, LKMA is headquartered on Pilies Street in Vilnius in a former bishop's apartment where bishops Jurgis Matulaitis and Mečislovas Reinys used to live.[36]

LKMA has four categories of members: true academic members (accomplished scientists elected by other true members), members, assistant members (those without academic degrees), and honorary members. It had 85 members in 1956, 188 in 1965, 226 in 1977, 263 in 1985, about 600 in 2001,[15] about 300 in 2008.[39] In 1922–2020, LKMA elected a total of 60 true academic members. Sofija Kanopkaitė and Angelė Vyšniauskaitė became the first women to become true members in 2000.[15] Since 2001, board members are elected for six-year terms instead of earlier three-year terms.[46]

LKMA had seven honorary members.[15] LKMA honorary members were:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Catholic_Academy_of_Science

Polonization,"Polonization or Polonisation (Polish: polonizacja)[1] is the acquisition or imposition of elements of Polish culture, in particular the Polish language. This happened in some historic periods among non-Polish populations in territories controlled by or substantially under the influence of Poland.

Like other examples of cultural assimilation, Polonization could be either voluntary or forced. It was most visible in territories where the Polish language or culture was dominant or where their adoption could result in increased prestige or social status, as was the case with the nobilities of Ruthenia and Lithuania. To a certain extent, political authorities have administratively promoted Polonization, particularly during the Second Polish Republic and in the period following World War II.

Polonization can be seen as an example of cultural assimilation. Such a view is widely considered applicable to the population of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), when the Ruthenian and Lithuanian upper classes were drawn towards Westernization with the adoption of Polish culture and the political and financial benefits of such a transition, as well as, sometimes, with the administrative pressure exerted on their own cultural institutions, primarily the Orthodox Church and Protestant by conversion to the Roman Catholic faith was often the single most important part of the process. For Ruthenians at that time, being Polish culturally and Roman Catholic by religion was almost the same. This diminishing of the Orthodox Church was the part most resented by the Belarusian and Ukrainian masses. In contrast, the Lithuanians, who were mostly Catholic, were in danger of losing their cultural identity as a nation, but that was not realized by the wide masses of Lithuanians until the Lithuanian national renaissance in the middle of the 19th century.

On the other hand, the Polonization policies of the Polish government during the interwar years of the 20th century, particularly in the Eastern Borderlands, were more deliberate. Some of them were similar to the mostly forcible assimilationist policies implemented by other European powers that have aspired to regional dominance (e.g., Germanization, Russification), while others resembled policies carried out by countries aiming at increasing the role of their native language and culture in their own societies (e.g., Magyarization, Romanianization, Ukrainization). For Poles, it was a process of rebuilding Polish national identity and reclaiming Polish heritage, including the fields of education, religion, infrastructure and administration, that suffered under the prolonged foreign occupation by the neighboring empires of Russia, Prussia, and Austria-Hungary. However, as a third of recreated Poland's population was ethnically non-Polish and many felt their own nationhood aspirations thwarted specifically by Poland, large segments of this population resisted to varying degrees the policies intended to assimilate them. Part of the country's leadership emphasized the need for the long-term ethnic and cultural homogeneity of the state. However, the promotion of the Polish language in administration, public life and especially education, were perceived by some as an attempt at forcible homogenization. In areas inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, for example, actions of the Polish authorities seen as aiming at restricting the influence of the Orthodox and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church caused additional resentment and were considered to be closely tied to religious Polonization.

Between the 12th and the 14th centuries, many towns in Poland adopted the so-called Magdeburg rights that promoted the towns' development and trade. The rights were usually granted by the king on the occasion of the arrival of migrants. Some integrated with the larger community, such as merchants who settled there, especially Greeks and Armenians. They adopted most aspects of Polish culture but kept their Orthodox faith. In Western Poland, many townspeople were Germans. Initially, trade guilds had been exclusively German-speaking. However, this began to change by increasing Polonization in the 15th and 16th centuries.[2]
Since the Middle Ages, Polish culture, influenced by the West, in turn radiated East, beginning the long process of cultural assimilation.[3]

Poles reached Lithuania long before the union of the two countries. In a letter to the German Franciscans, Grand Duke Gediminas asked them to send monks who spoke Samogitian, Ruthenian or Polish. Other sources mention Polish slave carers and educators of children. This indicates the presence of Poles, probably prisoners of war or their descendants.[4] Polish influence increased considerably after the Union of Krewo (1386). The Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila was offered the Polish crown and became Władysław II Jagiełło (reigned 1386–1434). This marked the beginning of the gradual, voluntary Polonization of the Lithuanian nobility.[5][6][7] Jagiełło built many churches in pagan Lithuanian land and provided them generously with estates, gave out the lands and positions to the Catholics, settled the cities and villages and granted the biggest cities and towns Magdeburg rights in their Polish variant.[8]

Lithuanian nobles were granted privileges modeled on those held by the Polish nobility. 47 families of Lithuanian families were adopted by 45 Polish families and endowed with Polish coats of arms. Lithuania adopted Polish political solutions and institutions. The offices of voivodes and castellans appeared, and the country was divided into voivodeships and powiats.[9] There was also a representation of the nobility, called Sejm, following the Polish model. However, unlike the Polish Sejm, the magnates had the deciding vote, and the petty and middle nobility only approved the decisions of the magnate's council.[10] Since the late 15th century marriages between Lithuanian and Polish magnates became more frequent. This brought the Lithuanians even closer to Polish culture. The first such marriage was the one between Mikołaj Tęczyński [pl] and the daughter of Alekna Sudimantaitis in 1478.[11]

Polish influence intensified in the period preceding the Union of Lublin. The royal court took steps to make the political and economic system of Lithuania more similar to Poland. An important step was the introduction of the hide system (Volok Reform – Polish: reforma włóczna), based on the Polish model. The reform was introduced by specialists from Poland, mainly from Mazovia, headed by Piotr Chwalczewski [pl]. Włóka was a Polish measure of land (in Ruthenian volok), and in Lithuania, it became the basis for land measurement. At the same time, Polish measures of area and distance were introduced, as well as a model of farming based on the folwark and three-field system.[12]

During the Reformation, voices were raised that Latin should be the language of the Lithuanians, due to the alleged proximity of the two languages and the legendary origin of the Lithuanian nobility from the Romans. However, this intention failed and Latin never reached the same position as in the Polish Crown.[13] Instead, Polish quickly took the place of the official language. At the beginning of the 17th-century instructions and resolutions of sejmiks were written down in Polish. In the period 1620–1630, the Polish language supplanted Ruthenian in the books of the Lithuanian Metrica.[13] When in 1697 the Sejm of the Commonwealth passed a resolution to replace Ruthenian language by Polish in all official actions, it only approved the long-standing status quo.[14] In addition to Polish, Latin was also used in the documents of the Lithuanian chancellery referring to the Catholic Church, cities under Magdeburg Law, Livonia and foreigners.[15]

Already at the beginning of the 16th century, Polish became the first language of the Lithuanian magnates. In the following century, it was adopted by the Lithuanian nobility in general. Even the nobility of Žemaitija used the Polish language already in the 17th century.[16] At the beginning of the 18th century, the Polish language was adopted by the entire nobility of the Grand Duchy – Lithuanian, Ruthenian, German and Tatar.[17] The Polish language also penetrated other social strata: the clergy, the townspeople, and even the peasants.[15]

Linguistic Polonization did not always mean full Polonization in the state or ethnic sense. The Lithuanian nobility felt united with the Polish nobility as part of one political nation of the Commonwealth, enjoying privileges, freedom and equality.[15] In this sense, they often referred to themselves as ""Polish nobility"" or outright ""Poles"". At the same time, separatism and the defense of Lithuanian national separateness within the federation state were very strong. The Lithuanian nobility was strongly attached to the laws, traditions and symbols of the Grand Duchy.[15] Moreover, the Lithuanian separateness was also defended by the members of ethnically Polish families settling in Lithuania.[15]

The spread of Polish culture was channelled through the Catholic Church. A large part of the Lithuanian clergy were Poles, either of Polish descent or from Polish families settled in Lithuania. Of the 123 known canons of Vilnius, only slightly more than half (66) were ethnic Lithuanians, and most of the others were of Polish origin.[18] The role of the church was important because it had a monopoly on teaching. By 1550, 11 schools were established in the Samogitian diocese and 85 in the Vilnius diocese.[19] In 1528 the diocese of Vilnius decreed that the language of instruction of religious texts should be Polish and Lithuanian.[19] Latin was taught exclusively in Polish, so children who did not know this language were taught Polish first.[20] Lithuanians went to Kraków to study, in 1409 professor of theology founded a dormitory for students from Grand Duchy[21] Overall 366 Lithuanian students studied in Kraków between 1430 and 1560.[19] In the 16th-century students from Lithuania were coming to Kraków already considerably Polonized. In 1513, Lithuanian students were accused of mocking the plain Polish speech of their colleagues from Mazovia before the university court.[22]

Polish had the advantage over Ruthenian and Lithuanian that its vocabulary, being influenced by Latin, allowed more abstract thoughts to be expressed. Moreover, its proximity to the Ruthenian language made its adoption all the more natural.[23] The Reformation, on the one hand, accelerated the development of literatures in Lithuanian, on the other hand, it contributed to an even faster spread of the Polish language. The Calvinist magnate Mikołaj ""the Black"" Radziwiłł published in Brest a Polish translation of the Bible for the use of Lithuanian Calvinists.[16]

The second important channel for the spread of the Polish language and culture was the royal and grand ducal court. After 1447, only for short periods there was a separate grand ducal court in Vilnius. But even then the Polish influence was strong. Already Grand Duke Vytautas employed Polish secretaries to run his Latin chancellery.[24] The Krakow court was dominated by Poles who travelled with the king to Lithuania. The Lithuanian nobles who joined the court were therefore greatly influenced by Polish culture. Casimir Jagiellon was the last grand duke to know Lithuanian.[25] From the time of Zygmunt August, correspondence with the Lithuanian elite was conducted almost exclusively in Polish,[25] since the knowledge of Latin in Lithuania was too weak.[citation needed]

Jogaila's successor Władysław III of Varna, who reigned in 1434–1444, expanded the privileges of the nobles to all Ruthenian nobles irrespective of their religion, and in 1443 signed a bull equalizing the Orthodox church in rights with the Roman Catholicism thus alleviating the relationship with the Orthodox clergy. These policies continued under the next king Casimir IV Jagiellon. Still, the most cultural expansion of the Polish influence continued since the Ruthenian nobility were attracted by both the glamour of the Western culture and the Polish political order where the magnates became the unrestricted rulers of the lands and serfs in their vast estates.[26]

In the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Ukrainian territories controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were transferred to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland,[27] and thus found themselves under the direct influence of the Polish culture and language.

Ukrainian lands of Kyiv and Braclav voivodeship were rather sparsely populated and attracted a lot of settlers, mostly from Volhynia, but also from central Poland. One of the reasons was that serfdom was not introduced there.[28] Among the settlers was also a petty nobility. Ruthenian, just like Lithuanian, nobility was attracted by the Polish culture, which at that time flourished. Many of them adopted the Polish language and customs, even converted to Roman Catholicism. Even for those who remained faithful to the Orthodox Church and Ruthenian language, Polish political identity became very important, as they were inspiring to be part of szlachta – a ruling, privileged elite.[29] It was at that time when the concept of gente Ruthenus, natione Polonus (a Poles of a Rus' religion[29]) was born. It all resulted in the almost complete abandonment of Ruthenian culture, traditions and the Orthodox Church by the Ruthenian higher class.[30]

The creation of the Greek Catholic Church, following the 1596 Union of Brest which sought to break the relations between Orthodox clergy in the Commonwealth and the Patriarchate in Moscow, put the Ruthenian people under stronger influence of Polish culture.[31][32] The unia was supported by the Polish authorities. In addition to the Unia itself, the eventual Latinization of the Unia was one of the components of Polonization.[33] The unia was accompanied by the spread of the Roman Catholic Church in the Ruthenian lands. Dioceses of the Roman Catholic Church were established as early as the 14th and 15th centuries by the Grand Dukes of Lithuania. After the Union of Lublin Jesuit schools were established by Ruthenian magnates.[34]

Some Ruthenian magnates like Sanguszko, Wiśniowiecki and Kisiel, resisted the cultural Polonization for several generations, with the Ostrogski family being one of the most prominent examples. Remaining generally loyal to the Polish state, the magnates, like Ostrogskis, stood by the religion of their forefathers, and supported the Orthodox Church generously by opening schools, printing books in Ruthenian language (the first four printed Cyrillic books in the world were published in Cracow, in 1491[35]) and giving generously to the Orthodox churches' construction. However, their resistance was gradually waning with each subsequent generation as more and more of the Ruthenian elite turned towards Polish language and Catholicism. Still, with most of the educational system getting Polonized and the most generously funded institutions being to the west of Ruthenia, the Ruthenian indigenous culture further deteriorated. In the Polish Ruthenia the language of the administrative paperwork started to gradually shift towards Polish. By the 16th century the language of administrative paperwork in Ruthenia was a peculiar mix of the older Church Slavonic with the Ruthenian language of the commoners and the Polish language. With the Polish influence in the mix gradually increasing it soon became mostly like the Polish language superimposed on the Ruthenian phonetics. The total confluence of Ruthenia and Poland was seen coming.[36]

Since Teutonic times the language of the Prussian elite and administration has been German. This did not change after the incorporation into the kingdom of Poland. It was only from the beginning of the 16th century that the role of the Polish language began to increase. Since 1527 there have been complaints from representatives of large cities that some council members use Polish, although they know German. In 1555, a canon of Gniezno delivered a speech to the Prussian Sejm in Polish, without the help of an interpreter. In the second half of the 16th century, royal decrees were issued in Polish, debates in the Landtag were held in Polish. Great Prussian families Polonized their names: the Baysen to Bażyński; the Zehmen to Cema; the Dameraw to Działyński, and the Mortangen to Mortęski, the Kleinfelds to Krupocki.[37]

Polonization also occurred during times when a Polish state did not exist, despite the empires that partition Poland applied the policies aimed at reversing the past gains of Polonization or aimed at replacing Polish identity and eradication of Polish national group.[38][39][40]

The Polonization took place in the early years of the Prussian partition, where, as a reaction to the persecution of Roman Catholicism during the Kulturkampf, German Catholics living in areas with a Polish majority voluntarily integrated themselves within Polish society, affecting approximately 100,000 Germans in the eastern provinces of Prussia.[38]

According to some scholars[who?] the biggest successes in Polonization of the non-Polish lands of former Commonwealth were achieved after the Partitions, in times of persecution of Polishness (noted by Leon Wasilewski) (1917[41]), Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky (1926[42]). Paradoxically, the substantial eastward movement of the Polish ethnic territory (over these lands) and growth of the Polish ethnic regions were taking place exactly in the period of the strongest Russian attack on everything Polish in Lithuania and Belarus.[43]

The general outline of causes for that is considered to include the activities of the Roman-Catholic Church[44] and the cultural influence exacted by the big cities (Vilna, Kovno) on these lands,[45] the activities of the Vilna educational district in 19th century–1820s,[46] the activities of the local administration, still controlled by the local Polish or already Polonized nobility up to the 1863–1864 January uprising,[47] secret (Polish) schools in second half nineteenth to the beginning of the 20th century (tajne komplety)[47] and the influence of the land estates.[47]

Following the demise of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the end of the 18th century, the Polonization trends initially continued in Lithuania, Belarus and Polish-dominated parts of Ukraine as the initially liberal policies of the Empire gave the Polish elite significant concessions in the local affairs. Dovnar-Zapolsky notes[48] that the Polonization actually intensified under the liberal rule[citation needed] of Alexander I, particularly due to the efforts of Polish intellectuals who led the Vilnius University which was organized in 1802–1803 from the Academy in Vilna (Schola Princeps Vilnensis), vastly expanded and given the highest Imperial status under the new name Vilna Imperial University (Imperatoria Universitas Vilnensis).[49] By the Emperor's order, the Vilna education district overseen by Adam Czartoryski, a personal friend of Alexander, was greatly expanded to include the vast territories in the West of the Russian Empire stretching to Kiev in south-east and much of the Polish territory and the development of the university, which had no rival in the whole district, received the highest priority of the Imperial authorities which granted it significant freedom and autonomy.[49] With the effort of Polish intellectuals who served the rectors of the university, Hieronim Strojnowski, Jan Śniadecki, Szymon Malewski, as well as Czartoryski who oversaw them, the university became the center of Polish patriotism and culture; and as the only University of the district the center attracted the young nobility of all ethnicities from this extensive region.[49][50]

With time, the traditional Latin was eliminated from the university and by 1816 it was fully replaced by Polish and Russian. This change both affected and reflected a profound change in the Belarusian and Lithuanian secondary schools systems where Latin was also traditionally used as the university was the main source of the teachers for these schools. Additionally, the university was responsible for the textbook selection and only Polish textbooks were approved for printing and usage.[50]

Dovnar-Zapolsky notes that ""the 1800s–1810s had seen the unprecedented prosperity of the Polish culture and language in the former Great Duchy of Lithuania lands"" and ""this era has seen the effective completion of the Polonization of the smallest nobility, with further reduction of the areal of use of the contemporary Belarusian language.[51] also noting that the Polonization trend had been complemented with the (covert) anti-Russian and anti-Eastern Orthodox trends.[52] The results of these trends are best reflected in the ethnic censuses in previously non-Polish territories.

Following the Polish November uprising aimed at breaking away from Russia, the Imperial policies finally changed abruptly.[citation needed]

In the 19th century, the mostly unchallenged Polonization trend of the previous centuries had been met staunchly by then ""anti-Polish"" Russification policy, with temporary successes on both sides, like Polonization rises in mid-1850s and in 1880s and Russification strengthenings in 1830s and in 1860s.[53] Any Polonization of the east and west territories (Russian and German partitions) occurred in the situation were Poles had steadily diminishing influence on the government. Partition of Poland posed a genuine threat to the continuation of Polish language-culture in those regions.[40] As Polonization was centered around Polish culture, policies aimed at weakening and destroying it had a significant impact on weakening Polonization of those regions. This was particularly visible in Russian-occupied Poland, where the Polish culture fared worst, as Russian administration gradually became strongly anti-Polish.[40] After a brief and relatively liberal early period in the early 19th century, where Poland was allowed to retain some autonomy as the Congress Poland puppet state,[54] the situation for Polish culture steadily worsened.

A complicated linguistic situation developed on the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Polish speakers used a ""Kresy"" variant of Polish (Northern Borderlands dialect) that retained archaic Polish features as well as many remnants of Belarusian and some features of Lithuanian.[55] Linguists distinguish between official language, used in the Church and cultural activities, and colloquial language, closer to the speech of the common people. Inhabitants of a significant part of the Vilnius region used a variant of the Belarusian language, which was influenced mainly by Polish, but also by Lithuanian, Russian and Jewish. This language was referred to as ""simple speech"" (Polish: mowa prosta), and was treated by many as a dialect variety of Polish. In fact, it was a kind of ""mixed language"" serving as an interdialect of the cultural borderland.[56] This language became a gateway to the progressive Slavization of the Lithuanian population.

The knowledge of Slavonic intedialect made it easier for Lithuanians to communicate with their Slavic neighbors, who spoke Polish, Russian, or Belarusian. The attractiveness and cultural prestige of the Polish language and its common use in church caused the process to continue and lead to the full adoption of the Polish language. Among the Belarusian population, the usage of Polish was limited to official relations, while at home, the local language was still spoken.[57] As a result, the Lithuanian language retreated under the pressure of Polish faster than Belarusian. This led to the formation of a compact Polish language area between the Lithuanian and Belarusian language areas, with Vilnius as the center.[58] After some time, especially in the Vilnius region, ignorance of the Polish language was considered a lack of cultural savvy. In ceremonial situations it was advisable to use Polish. This gradually limited the use of simple speech to everyday life situations, and gave rise to a sense of contempt for it and Belarusian as the language of work, cursing, but also more emotional and impetuous.[59]

In the Belarusian territories, the Polonization processes were intensified by the struggle of the Russian authorities against the Catholic Churches. The liquidation of the Uniate Church and forced conversions to Orthodoxy provoked resistance among the local community. The Russian authorities opposed the Catholic Church, called the ""Polish faith"", to the Orthodox Church, called the ""Russian faith"". As a result, referring to oneself as a ""Pole"" was the same as referring to oneself as a ""Catholic.""[60] After Latin, Polish was considered the second language of worship, so attempts to replace it with Russian or local languages were resisted by local population.[61]

The spread of Polish language and culture, and eventually Polish national consciousness, was fostered not only by its prevalence among the upper classes, but also among the impoverished, declassed nobility. Their representatives regarded the nobility's traditions, inextricably linked with Polishness, as a marker of prestige, so they cultivated their attachment to the Polish national tradition. And due to the lack of an impassable property and cultural barrier, they exerted influence on the surrounding peasantry.[62] Paradoxically, this was fostered by the anti-Polish and anti-szlachta Russian policy, which gave relief to peasants for the purchase of land. As a result, the property gap between the petty gentry and the peasantry decreased, which resulted in the appearance of mixed marriages, which in turn led to the spread of Polish culture among the peasants.[63]

The emergence of the Lithuanian national movement in the 1880s slowed down the process of Polonization of the ethnically Lithuanian population, but also cemented a sense of national identity among a significant portion of the Polish-speaking Lithuanian population. The feeling of a two-tier Lithuanian-Polish national identity, present throughout the period, had to give way to a clear national declaration. Previously, every inhabitant of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been considered a Lithuanian, but in the face of the emergence of the Lithuanian national movement, which considered only those who spoke Lithuanian as Lithuanians, Polish-speaking residents of Lithuania more and more often declared themselves as Poles.[64] The dispute over the auxiliary language of services (Polish or Lithuanian) in the churches on the eastern border of ethnic Lithuania, which heated up from the end of the nineteenth century, influenced the formation of Polish consciousness and the adoption of the Polish language among those believers whose ancestors had abandoned Lithuanian for plain speech.[65]

The Lithuanian historian Vaidas Banys has said the following about Polonization within the Catholic Church of Lithuania in the 19th century:

""The 'Polonomaniacs' announced that the Catholic Church in Lithuania is a Polish church and no other national manifestations are welcome in it. Lithuanian religious services were obstructed, while there was whistling during Lithuanian singing and even fistfights. One event resounded throughout all of Lithuania in 1901, when a jubilee cross with a Lithuanian inscription was thrown away from Šėta's church. So-called 'Lithuanomaniacs' (Polish: litwomany) priests were punished, moved to poorer parishes, or humiliated in their ministry.""[66]

According to the Polish census of 1921 ethnically Polish population constituted about 69% of the population of the reborn state. The largest minorities in interwar Poland were Ukrainians, Jews, Belarusians and Germans. The Polish government's policy toward each minority varied, and also changed over time. In general, during the first period of democratic rule dominated by national democracy, there was a tendency to restrict the rights of minorities and pursue Polonization. This changed with the 1926 coup and the assumption of power by Sanation. Policies became more liberal and minority autonomy increased. However, this began to change for the worse a few years before the start of World War II.

Assimilation was considered by National Democrats to be a major factor for ""unifying the state"". They hoped that the attractiveness of Polish culture, above all to Slavic minorities, would help to make rapid peaceful assimilation without much resistance.[67] The centrist and leftist parties pointed out that the nation-building processes in the eastern lands could not be reversed. They called, therefore, for conducting so-called state assimilation, that is, granting broad cultural and territorial autonomy, in exchange for loyalty to the Polish state.[68][69] Such policy was partially conducted by the Sanation regime, especially under leadership of Józef Piłsudski in years 1926–1935.

Polonization also created a new educated class among the non-Polish minorities, a class of intellectuals aware of the importance of schooling, press, literature and theatre, who became instrumental in the development of their own ethnic identities.[70]

Belarusians in Poland were a poorly educated group, 90% of them making their living by farming. The aspiration of the Belarusians was to achieve cultural autonomy, as well as fair land reform.[71] The maximum number of people of Belarusian nationality in interwar Poland was about 2 million. It is difficult to determine a definite number because for the most part, they did not have an established sense of their national identity; they described their language as ""Tutejszy"" ""simple speech"" (Polish: mowa prosta) or ""Poleshuk"" (in Polesia).[72] Additionally, after two centuries of Polish influence, Catholic Belarusians naturally leaned toward Polish culture and often referred to themselves as ""Poles"" even though they spoke Belarusian.[72]

The Polish state's policy toward them was not consistent. Initially, during the period of fighting over the eastern border, the activities of Belarusian activists were tolerated. However, this changed after the peace came. In 1924, the Law on Minority Education led to the closure of a huge part of the approximately 350[73] (or 514[74]) existing Belarusian schools, opened mostly during the German occupation. A 19 bilingual schools and just three elementary Belarusian schools remained.[73][75] Officials prevented the creation of new schools, despite meeting formal conditions.[76]

The change came after the May Coup of 1926. Despite the abolition of the Belarusian Belarusian Social Democratic Party, for its contacts with the Comintern, there was a period of liberalization of educational policy. The new Minister of Education, Gustav Dobrotsky, ordered the dismissal of officials blocking the establishment of new schools, allowed new schools to open in Catholic communities as well, and organized Belarusian language courses for elementary school teachers. As a result, four Belarusian grammar schools and a dozen elementary schools were opened.[77] The results, however, were poor. In 1928, there were only 69 schools with Belarusian language, all of them in Wilno and Nowogródek voivodeships, very small number in comparison with 2 164 Polish schools existing there.[78] The reversal of this policy came quickly, and after 1929 the number of Belarusian schools began to decline again. Of the Belarusian gymnasiums existing in Vilnius, Navahrudak, Kletsk and Radashkovichy, only the Vilnius gymnasium had survived to 1939.[75] Belarusian schools often conducted classes in Russian, this was especially true of gymnasiums. This resulted from the significant Russification of the Belarusian intelligentsia.[79] The Polish officials often treated any Belarusian demanding schooling in Belarusian language as a Soviet spy and any Belarusian social activity as a product of a communist plot.[80]

Orthodox Christians also faced discrimination in interwar Poland.[81] This discrimination was also targeting assimilation of Eastern Orthodox Belarusians.[82] The Polish authorities were imposing Polish language in Orthodox church services and ceremonies,[82] initiated the creation of Polish Orthodox Societies in various parts of West Belarus (Slonim, Białystok, Vaŭkavysk, Navahrudak).[82]

Belarusian Roman Catholic priests like Fr. Vincent Hadleŭski[82] who promoted Belarusian language in the church and Belarusian national awareness were also under serious pressure by the Polish regime and the leadership of the Catholic Church in Poland.[82] The Polish Catholic Church issued documents to priests prohibiting the usage of the Belarusian language rather than Polish language in Churches and Catholic Sunday Schools in West Belarus. A 1921 Warsaw-published instruction of the Polish Catholic Church criticized the priests introducing the Belarusian language in religious life: They want to switch from the rich Polish language to a language that the people themselves call simple and shabby.[83]

The Belarusian civil society resisted Polonization and mass closure of Belarusian schools. The Belarusian Schools Society (Belarusian: Таварыства беларускай школы), led by Branisłaŭ Taraškievič and other activists, was the main organization promoting education in Belarusian language in West Belarus in 1921–1937.

Compared to the (larger) Ukrainian minority living in Poland, Belarusians were much less politically aware and active. Nevertheless, according to Belarusian historians, the policies by the Polish government against the population of West Belarus increasingly provoked protests[81] and armed resistance. In the 1920s, Belarusian partisan units arose in many areas of West Belarus, mostly unorganized but sometimes led by activists of Belarusian left wing parties.[81] In the spring of 1922, several thousands Belarusian partisans issued a demand to the Polish government to stop the violence, to liberate political prisoners and to grant autonomy to West Belarus.[81] Protests were held in various regions of West Belarus until mid 1930s.[81]

The largest Belarusian political organization, the Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union (or, the Hramada), which demanded a stop to the Polonization and autonomy for West Belarus, grew more radicalized by the time. It received logistical help from the Soviet Union,[84] and financial aid from the Comintern.[85] By 1927 Hramada was controlled entirely by agents from Moscow.[84] It was banned by the Polish authorities,[84] and further opposition to the Polish government was met with state-imposed sanctions once the connection between Hramada and the more radical pro-Soviet Communist Party of Western Belarus was discovered.[84] The Polish policy was met with armed resistance.[86]

Interwar Poland was inhabited by 4-5 million Ukrainians. They lived primarily in the areas of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia.[87] Until the First World War, Galicia with its large Ukrainian Greek Catholic population in the east (around Lviv) was controlled by the Austrian Empire.[69] On the other hand, the Ukrainians of Volhynia, formerly of the Russian Empire (around Rivne), were largely Orthodox, and were influenced by strong Russophile trends.[69] National self-identification was much stronger among the Galician Ukrainians,

While the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which is in communion with the Catholic Church, hoped to receive a better treatment in Poland where the leadership saw Catholicism as one of the main tools to unify the nation – the Poles under Stanisław Grabski saw the restless Galician Ukrainians as less reliable than the Eastern Orthodox Volhynian Ukrainians,[69] seen as better candidates for gradual assimilation. That's why the Polish policy in Ukraine initially aimed at keeping Greek Catholic Galicians from further influencing Orthodox Volhynians by drawing the so-called ""Sokalski line"".[69]

Due to the region's history the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church attained a strong Ukrainian national character, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a visit with Ukrainian Greek Catholics in North America and western Europe, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was initially denied reentry to Lviv for a considerable amount of time. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Catholics, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.[88]

With respect to the Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian population in eastern Poland, the Polish government initially issued a decree defending the rights of the Orthodox minorities. In practice, this often failed, as the Catholics, also eager to strengthen their position, had official representation in the Sejm and the courts. Any accusation was strong enough for a particular church to be confiscated and handed over to the Catholic Church. The goal of the two so called ""revindication campaigns"" was to reverse the gains of the Orthodox Church from the partitions period and to return to the Catholics those churches that had been converted into Orthodox churches by the Russian authorities.[89][90][91] 190 Orthodox churches were destroyed, some of the destroyed churches were abandoned,[92] and 150 more were forcibly transformed into Roman Catholic (not Greek Catholic) churches.[93] Such actions were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, who claimed that these acts would ""destroy in the souls of our non-united Orthodox brothers the very thought of any possible reunion.""[88]

The Polish administration closed many of the Prosvita reading rooms. The number of reading rooms declined from 2,879 in 1914 to only 843 in 1923. The decline can be partially explained by the war devastation.[94]

In independent Poland, education was centralized, and provincial school administration was abolished, as happened with Lwów-based separate Ukrainian representation.[94] In 1924 the law was passed, which set up bilingual Ukrainian and Polish schools. As a result, number of Ukrainian unilingual schools declined, and they were replaced by bilingual schools. This affected Eastern Galicia most severely, where before the war there were 2,400 Ukrainian elementary schools, and during the existence of the West Ukrainian People's Republic their number increased to about 3,000. After the region was annexed to Poland, the number began to decline, in 1923 it was 2453, in 1925 it was still 2151, but after the introduction of bilingual schools there was a rapid decline to 648 schools in 1930 and 352 in 1938. At the same time, the number of bilingual schools grew from 9 in 1925 to 1,793 in 1930 and to 2,485 in 1938. The number of Polish schools also declined from 2,568 schools in 1925 to 2,161 in 1938.

The principle of ""numerus clausus"" had been introduced following which the Ukrainians were discriminated when entering the Uniwersytet Jana Kazimierza (not more than 15% of the applicants' total number, the Poles enjoying not less than the 50% quota at the same time).[95]

The land reform was designed to favor ethnic Polish population.[96] By 1938 some 800,000 hectares had been redistributed within Ukrainian-inhabited areas. The redistribution did not necessarily help the local Ukrainian population, however. In 1920 in Volhynia and Polissia 39 percent of the allotted land (312,000 hectares) had been awarded to Polish war veterans. In Eastern Galicia 200,000 hectare had been given to Polish peasants from the western provinces of the country. By the 1930s the number of Poles living within contiguous Ukrainian ethnographic territory had increased by about 300,000.[97]

During the interwar period of the 20th century (1920–1939), Lithuanian–Polish relations were characterized by mutual enmity. As a consequence of the conflict over the city of Vilnius, and the Polish–Lithuanian War, both governments – in the era of nationalism which was sweeping through Europe – treated their respective minorities harshly.[98][99][100] In 1920, after the staged mutiny of Lucjan Żeligowski, Lithuanian cultural activities in Polish controlled territories were limited and the closure of Lithuanian newspapers and the arrest of their editors occurred.[101] 33 Lithuanian and Belarusian cultural activists were formally expelled from Vilnius on 23 January 1922 and deported to Lithuania.[101] In 1927, as tensions between Lithuania and Poland increased, 48 additional Lithuanian schools were closed and another 11 Lithuanian activists were deported.[98] Following Piłsudski's death in 1935, the Lithuanian minority in Poland again became an object of Polonization policies with greater intensity. 266 Lithuanian schools were closed after 1936 and almost all Lithuanian organizations were banned. Further Polonization ensued as the government encouraged settlement of Polish army veterans in the disputed regions.[100] About 400 Lithuanian reading rooms and libraries were closed in Poland between 1936 and 1938.[99] Following the 1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania, Lithuania re-established diplomatic relations with Poland and efforts to Polonize Lithuanians living in Poland decreased somewhat.[citation needed]

During Operation Vistula of 1947, the Soviet-controlled Polish communist authorities removed the support base for the still active in that area Ukrainian Insurgent Army by forcibly resettling about 141,000 civilians residing around Bieszczady and Low Beskids to northern areas of the so-called Recovered Territories awarded by the Allies to Poland in the post-war settlement. The farmers received financial help from the Polish government and took over homes and farms left behind by the displaced Germans, in most cases improving their living conditions due to the increased size of the newly reassigned properties, brick buildings, and running water.[102] Dr Zbigniew Palski from IPN explains that an identical operation was performed in Ukraine by the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic at exactly the same time. It was dubbed Operation West. Both operations were coordinated from Moscow; however, there was a shocking difference between their outcomes.[102]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonization

Supreme Tribunal of Lithuania,"The Supreme Tribunal of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Vyriausiasis Tribunolas) was the highest court in interwar Lithuania. Officially established in December 1918, the court held its first proceedings in August 1919. Initially, it served as an appeals court for cases first decided by the district courts. Its competency was steadily expanded to encompass cases referred from the Army Court in July 1919, cassation cases from the justices of the peace in June 1921, cases from the Klaipėda Region (Memelland) in 1923, and certain functions of an administrative court. The judicial reform in 1933 created a new appeals court leaving the Supreme Tribunal with functions of a court of cassation and an administrative court. Its main task was to interpret and consistently apply the laws. The tribunal handled some controversial high-profile cases, including the case of Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras and corruption cases of Prime Minister Vytautas Petrulis and Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Purickis. The court was abolished and replaced by the Supreme Court of the Lithuanian SSR in September 1940. The tribunal was briefly resurrected during the German occupation of Lithuania.

Generally, the court proceedings were presided by a panel of three judges. The judges were nominated by the Minister of Justice and confirmed by the President of Lithuania. As the membership of the court grew very slowly (a third judge was added only in June 1921 and the fourth in July 1923) while the number of cases grew significantly, the court frequently invited district judges and even sworn attorneys to the bench. The practice was abolished by the reform in 1933 which set the number of tribunal judges at 15. The court was chaired by Antanas Kriščiukaitis (1918–1933) and Liudas Ciplijauskas (1934–1940). Other notable members included Michał Pius Römer and Silvestras Leonas.

The Council of Lithuania declared independence of Lithuania in February 1918, but was unable to take control of the country due to the continued presence of German Ober Ost officials and military. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Council adopted a temporary law on the court system in Lithuania on 28 November. After the temporary constitution, it was the second law to be adopted and was in effect until 1933.[1] The law established a three-tier court system with the Supreme Tribunal based in Vilnius at the top.[2] Antanas Kriščiukaitis was appointed as the chairman of the tribunal on 10 December and was supposed to take over the German courts on 15 December, but the plans were interrupted by the outbreak of the Lithuanian–Soviet War. The Lithuanian government evacuated from Vilnius to Kaunas. Kriščiukaitis remained in Vilnius until he was recalled to Kaunas in June 1919. The second judge, Augustinas Janulaitis, was appointed to the tribunal on 16 May. The court held its first proceeding on 2 August 1919.[2]

After the Soviet occupation of Lithuania in June 1940, the tribunal was reduced to two members and officially liquidated on 26 September 1940 by a decree of the Council of People's Commissars. It was replaced by the Supreme Court of the Lithuanian SSR.[2] After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Provisional Government of Lithuania ordered reestablishment of the pre-Soviet court system. Liudas Ciplijauskas, former chairman of the tribunal, was ordered to resurrect the Supreme Tribunal on 4 July 1941. The tribunal with three judges (Ciplijauskas, Jonas Gudauskis [lt], and Saliamonas Baltūsis [lt]) started its work, but it was effectively disbanded on 14 February 1942 when officials of the Reichskommissariat Ostland did not sanction its continued work (other Lithuanian courts were allowed to function).[2]

Initially, the tribunal was limited to acting as an appeals court for cases that were first decided by the district courts (the cases decided by justices of the peace and appealed to the district courts were not appealable to the tribunal).[2] Due to difficult economic situation and lack of educated jurists, Lithuania did not have a separate court of cassation and it was hoped that since there is only one Supreme Tribunal for the entire country it could also handle the function of law interpretation. In July 1919, the tribunal became a court of cassation for cases referred from the Army Court (until 1928, some political cases from the Army Court could also be reviewed for the facts of the case). With the ongoing Lithuanian Wars of Independence (ended in November 1920) and the continued martial law (lifted only in November 1939), the Army Court was very active. In 1920–1929, the tribunal handled 854 cases from the Army Court (152 appeals and 702 cassations). In June 1921, the competency of the tribunal was expanded to act as a court of cassation for cases decided by the justices of the peace and appealed to the district courts.[2]

After the Klaipėda Region (Memelland) was incorporated as an autonomous region of Lithuania in 1923, the tribunal was tasked with handling the cases from the region. However, they needed to be presided by a majority of judges who were selected from the Klaipėda magistrates and who received lifetime appointments from the President of Lithuania.[2] The first such members were Friedrich Plümicke and Anton Hesse. Until 1933, when they were moved to Kaunas, proceedings related to the cases from the Klaipėda Region took place mostly in Klaipėda (Memel). Until 1932, the tribunal handled about 2,000 cases related to the region. The competency of the tribunal was further expanded by assigning certain functions to an administrative court. For example, it could hear complaints regarding the implementation of the land reform of 1922 or decrees of ministers or country governors related to municipal matters.[2]

The judicial reform adopted in July 1933 created a new appeals court leaving the tribunal as the court of cassation for cases handled by the district courts, new appeals court, Army Court, and courts of the Klaipėda Region.[2] In addition, the tribunal was tasked with the administrative and magistrate disciplinary cases from the Klaipėda Region, criminal cases that Seimas could bring against members of the government or the President, and cases that were specifically enumerated in other laws. By 1938, the number of such laws that assigned various administrative cases to the tribunal grew to about 60. After the reform in 1933, the tribunal was divided into three sections: criminal law, civil law, and Klaipėda Region. No separate section was established for the military cases, but their proceedings had to include a tribunal member specifically selected for a three-year term from the military judges.[2] The Klaipėda section was closed when Lithuania lost the region after the German ultimatum of March 1939. Further, the reform officially recognized the general meetings of the tribunal's members. The meeting, which needed a quorum of at least two-thirds of all tribunal judges, could interpret and rule on laws that were inconsistently applied by various courts. It was also the only institution for resolving jurisdictional disputes.[2] The issues could be brought up by the Minister of Justice or by the chairman of the tribunal; the tribunal judges could also initiate a general meeting if they felt that a previous case or decision needed to be overturned.[3] The reform also established a disciplinary court for judges and a commission for judges' examination under the jurisdiction of the tribunal.[2]

In the first post-war years, the court managed to complete relatively few cases a year as it lacked judges. Its workload continued to grow as its competencies were expanded. The number of cases stabilized after the separate appeals court was established in 1933.[2] In 1927, about 6.5% of cases from Kaunas district were appealed to the Supreme Tribunal.[1] The tribunal handled some controversial high-profile cases, including corruption cases of Prime Minister Vytautas Petrulis and Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Purickis, case of Prime Minister Augustinas Voldemaras (1932),[1] as well as the murder charges against priest Konstantinas Olšauskas[4] and slander charges against Jonas Šliūpas.[5]

The tribunal had to deal with the fact that Lithuania inherited four different sets of laws that, unless replaced by a new law, continued to be in effect. For example, four different civil codes were in effect in Lithuania: Volume 10 of the Digest of Laws of the Russian Empire was in effect in most of Lithuania,[6] the Napoleonic and other French laws in Suvalkija, the German Civil Code in the Klaipėda Region, and the Private Law [ru] of the Baltic Governorates in Palanga and small areas near Zarasai.[7] Independent Lithuania did not manage to adopt a new civil or criminal code.[7][8] Since old Russians laws were still in effect in most of Lithuania, the decisions and rulings of the Russian Governing Senate were widely cited and used in practice even though the Lithuanian tribunal ruled in 1923 that such decisions were equal to a personal opinion of a jurist.[3]

In July 1920, the tribunal ruled that all legal proceedings need to be conducted in the Lithuanian language. It elicited a number of complaints from Russian-speaking attorneys and judges. Later, an exception was made for cases from the Klaipėda Region that could also be conducted in German.[2] There was no official publication of the court's decisions. Chairman Kriščiukaitis published summary reviews of the proceedings in journal Teisė (Law) that he edited. He edited 23 issues of Teisė and prepared 18 reviews. After his death in 1933, the reviews ceased.[1] Several unofficial collections of tribunal's decisions were published by various authors. The judicial reform in 1933 mandated that the proceedings were published. They were published as a supplement to Teisė. In total, Teisė published about half of the tribunal's decisions and rulings – approximately 5,000 documents: 1,500 criminal cases, 2,800 civil cases, and 450 resolutions of the tribunal's general meetings.[2]

The judges were nominated by the Minister of Justice and confirmed by the President of Lithuania. The tribunal's proceedings were supposed to be presided by three judges. The first two members, chairman Antanas Kriščiukaitis and Augustinas Janulaitis, were appointed in December 1918 and May 1919. The tribunal had to invite judges from district courts to attend the proceedings until the third member, Michał Pius Römer, was appointed in June 1921.[2]  The fourth judge was added in July 1923, two special judges were added in 1924 to handle cases related to the Klaipėda Region, and three judges were added in 1926.[1] However, the workload increased faster than the number of tribunal judges – the number of cases per judge grew tenfold from 65 in 1920 to 659 in 1925, while the number of completed cases declined from 88% to 62% in the same period.[9] Therefore, the court continued to invite district judges and even sworn attorneys to the bench. The practice was abolished during the reforms of 1933.[2]

The tribunal valued its independence and resisted political appointments. In 1922, Minister of Justice Vincas Karoblis [lt] wanted to appoint the fourth judge, but members of the tribunal protested and threatened to resign if the minister pushed his candidate through.[1] In 1925, Minister Antanas Tumėnas reassigned Janulaitis from the tribunal to the district count in Panevėžys. Tumėnas was served an interpellation and was questioned why he made the appointments without Janulaitis' request or consent as dictated by the Russian laws that Lithuania inherited.[10]

By 1933, the tribunal had 16 judges appointed; during the same time, four were reassigned or resigned. The reforms of 1933 set the number of tribunal members to 15, which was increased to 17 in 1938. After the death of Kriščiukaitis in October 1933, Liudas Ciplijauskas became the new chairman.[2] The civil section was headed by Motiejus Čepas and Simanas Petrauskas, the criminal section was headed by Juozas Brazaitis, the Klaipėda section was headed by Jonas Staškevičius, Martynas Bruzdeilinas, and Jonas Danauskas. The military judges were Vladas Mieželis and Julius Matulevičius. In early 1940, the tribunal had 16 judges: Liudas Ciplijauskas, Simanas Petrauskas, Juozas Brazaitis, Petras Adomavičius, Saliamonas Baltūsis, J. Boreika, Martynas Brazdeilinas, Česlovas Butkys, Juozas Grigaitis, Silvestras Leonas, Mykolas Mataitis, Julius Matulevičius, Napoleonas Morkvėnas, Jonas Staškevičius, Aleksas Vaitonis, A.

Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania,"The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania or Act of 11 March (Lithuanian: Aktas dėl Lietuvos nepriklausomos valstybės atstatymo) was an independence declaration by Lithuania adopted on 11 March 1990, signed by all[1] members of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania led by Sąjūdis. The act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the interwar-period Lithuania, which was occupied by the Soviet Union and annexed in June 1940. In March 1990, it was the first of the 15 Soviet republics to declare independence, with the rest following to continue for 21 months, concluding with Kazakhstan's independence in 1991. These events (part of the broader process dubbed the ""parade of sovereignties"") led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

After the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Council of Lithuania, chaired by Jonas Basanavičius, proclaimed the Act of Independence of Lithuania on 16 February 1918. Lithuania enjoyed independence for two decades. In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. The Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) were assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence and subsequently were occupied in June 1940 and converted into soviet socialist republics.

In Lithuania's case, President Antanas Smetona left the country rather than accept the occupation.  He did not resign but turned over his presidential duties to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys as per the constitution.  The next day, Merkys declared himself president in his own right. The cabinet confirmed Merkys in office, claiming that Smetona had effectively resigned by leaving the country.

Two days later, under Soviet pressure, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis, a left-wing journalist and longtime opponent of the Smetona regime, as prime minister.  Merkys then resigned at Moscow's insistence, making Paleckis acting president as well. The Soviets then used the Paleckis government to give the final Soviet takeover the appearance of legality.

The Paleckis government staged a heavily rigged election for a ""People's Seimas,"" in which voters were presented with a single Communist-dominated list. The newly elected People's Seimas met on 21 July with only one piece of business–a resolution declaring Lithuania a Soviet republic and petitioning for admission to the Soviet Union, which carried unanimously. The Soviet Union duly ""approved"" the request on 3 August. Since then, Soviet sources have maintained that Lithuania's petition to join the Soviet Union marked the culmination of a Lithuanian socialist revolution, and thus represented the legitimate desire of the Lithuanian people to join the Soviet Union.

The Soviet authorities undertook Sovietization policies: nationalization of all private property, collectivization of agriculture, suppression of the Catholic Church, and the imposition of totalitarian control. At the same time, free education and free national health system were also introduced. The armed anti-Soviet partisans were liquidated by 1953. Approximately 130,000 Lithuanians, dubbed ""enemies of the people"", were deported into Siberia (see Soviet deportations from Lithuania). After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the Soviet Union adopted de-Stalinization policies and ended mass persecutions. Nonviolent resistance continued both in Lithuania and among the Lithuanian diaspora. These movements were secret, illegal, and more focused on social issues, human rights, and cultural affairs rather than political demands.

As Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to revive the economy of the Soviet Union, he introduced glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring).

Gorbachev's political agenda went for great and deep changes within the Soviet government, as such, Gorbachev invited the Soviet public into open and public discussions unseen before.

For the Soviet Lithuanian dissidents and activists, it was a golden opportunity not to be missed, to bring their movements from underground into the public life.

On 23 August 1987 (the 48th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), the Lithuanian Liberty League organized the first public protest rally that did not result in arrests.

Encouraged by the non arrests, by mid-1988, a group of 35 intellectuals organized the Sąjūdis Reform Movement with the original goal of supporting, discussing, and implementing Gorbachev's reforms yet short of openly supporting independence from the USSR.

However, Sąjūdis grew in popularity, attracting large crowds to rallies in Vingis Park and therefore radicalizing its agenda, taking advantage of Gorbachev's passiveness.

In 1989, Sąjūdis, not afraid of angering Moscow and causing a violent crackdown, continuously pushed further with its demands: from limited discussions on Gorbachev's reforms, to demand greater say in economic decisions, to political autonomy within the Soviet Union.

By the time of the Baltic Way, a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres (370 mi) across the three Baltic states to mark the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the official goal of Sąjūdis was now independence for Lithuania.

Similar processes happened in other Soviet republics during 1988-1991, collectively known as the ""parade of sovereignties"", which were the major factor contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Parliamentary elections of February 1990 were the first free and democratic elections in Lithuania since 1926. The voters overwhelmingly voted for the candidates endorsed by Sąjūdis, even though the movement did not run as a political party. The result was the first post-war non-communist government. During its first assembly on 11 March 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR elected Vytautas Landsbergis as its chairman and restored Lithuania's prewar name of the Republic of Lithuania. It then changed its name to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, and formally declared the re-establishment of Lithuanian independence. The act was approved at 10:44 pm by 124 members of the council while six abstained.[1] There were no votes against.

SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

On the Re-establishment of the State of Lithuania

The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing the will of the nation, decrees and solemnly proclaims that the execution of the sovereign powers of the State of Lithuania abolished by foreign forces in 1940, is re-established, and henceforth Lithuania is again an independent state.

The Act of Independence of 16 February 1918 of the Council of Lithuania and the Constituent Assembly decree of 15 May 1920 on the re-established democratic State of Lithuania never lost their legal effect and comprise the constitutional foundation of the State of Lithuania.

The territory of Lithuania is whole and indivisible, and the constitution of no other State is valid on it.

The State of Lithuania stresses its adherence to universally recognized principles of international law, recognizes the principle of inviolability of borders as formulated in the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Helsinki in 1975, and guarantees human, civil, and ethnic community rights.

The Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, expressing sovereign power, by this Act begins to realize the complete sovereignty of the state.[2]

The Supreme Council took the line that Lithuania's original declaration of independence in 1918 was still valid, and considered the Act to be a reassertion of an independence that still legally existed under international law. It was based on the premise that Smetona never resigned, and Merkys' takeover of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional. Lithuania's official position on the matter since then has been that all subsequent acts leading up to the Soviet annexation were ipso facto void.

The Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania served as a model and inspiration to other Soviet republics. However, the issue of independence was not immediately settled and recognition by other countries was not certain.

Mikhail Gorbachev called the Act of Independence illegal and the USSR demanded revocation of the Act and began applying sanctions against Lithuania including an economic blockade. In addition, on 13 January 1991 Soviet forces stormed the LRT building in Vilnius along with the Vilnius TV Tower.

Unarmed civilian Lithuanians confronted Soviet soldiers. Fourteen people were killed and seven hundred injured in what became known as the January Events.

On 31 May 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Moldavian SSR voted to recognize the Restoration of the Independence of Lithuania.[3] The Parliament of Moldavia was the first legislature in the world to recognize Lithuania's independence, although Moldavia was still part of the Soviet Union. The Moldavian Supreme Soviet promised to establish an embassy to Lithuania in the near future.[4]

On 13 January 1991, during Soviet forces stormed the LRT building in Vilnius, Russian leader B.Yeltsin arrived in Tallinn, and with the leaders of the Baltic countries he signed a joint declaration, recognising one another's independence/sovereignty.[5] Later, on 27 July 1991, the Russian government re-recognized Lithuania and the two countries re-established diplomatic relations on 9 October 1991.

On 11 February 1991 the Icelandic parliament voted to confirm that Iceland's 1922 recognition of Lithuanian independence was still in full effect, as it never formally recognized the Soviet Union's control over Lithuania,[6] and that full diplomatic relations should be established as soon as possible.[7][8] In response, the Soviet Union recalled its ambassador to Iceland.[9] Iceland was later followed by Denmark,[10] Slovenia, Croatia (then a constituent republic of Yugoslavia), and Latvia. Denmark's ambassador to Lithuania arrived on 26 August; he was the first foreign diplomat accredited to Lithuania after its declaration of independence.[11]

On 26 August 1991 Lithuanian border guards were posted at border crossings between Lithuania and Russia, and the Republic of Lithuania began issuing visas.[12] The first visas were issued to members of the Lithuanian Opera Company, a Chicago-based group of Americans of Lithuanian descent who had arrived to perform for three weeks in the country.[12] At first, citizens of the Soviet Union and anyone with a visa for the Soviet Union automatically qualified for a visa upon arrival to Lithuania; later, the country instituted its own visa rules.[12]

After the failed August Coup, Lithuanian independence recognition was reconfirmed by the United States on 2 September.[13] President George H. W. Bush announced that if the Soviet Union were to use armed force against Lithuania, the U.S. would react accordingly. Bush's administration said that he had been waiting to recognize Lithuanian independence until the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union did so first, but Bush later decided he could not wait any longer.[13]

Finally, on 6 September 1991 Lithuania's independence was recognized by the State Council of the Soviet Union.[14] Its recognition of Lithuania's independence was quickly followed by several countries including China, India, and Belarus as well as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

On 17 September 1991 the United Nations admitted Lithuania as a member.[15] On the same day, the United Nations also admitted Estonia, Latvia, Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, North Korea, and South Korea as members.[15]

On 29 March 2004 Lithuania became a member of NATO.[16] On 1 May 2004 Lithuania also became a member of the European Union.[17] The country banned displays of Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_the_Re-Establishment_of_the_State_of_Lithuania
1576 Polish–Lithuanian royal election,"The free election of 1576 was the second royal election to be held in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which took place in 1575/1576. In the night of June 28–29, 1574, King Henry III of France secretly left Poland to claim the French throne. The Commonwealth was left without a monarch, and the period of interregnum ended with a double election. After a few months of negotiations, Anna Jagiellon and Stephen Báthory were elected co-rulers.

Henry was elected king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573.[1] After finding out about the death of his brother, King Charles IX of France, who died on 30 May 1574, Henry decided to secretly leave Poland, and return to his homeland. This plan was supported by his mother, Catherine de' Medici, who resumed the regency until Henry's return from Poland. Polish nobility had previously considered this option: Henry was to marry Anna Jagiellon, and return to France, leaving his wife in the Commonwealth. Thus, the two nations would be ruled by a royal couple.

Since the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was left without a monarch, and there was uncertainty and fear of civil strife, in late August 1574 the Primate of Poland called a council of senators and magnate. The council, which did not include envoys from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Duchy of Livonia and Royal Prussia, discussed whether Henry should still be regarded King of Poland. After lengthy deliberations, Henry was called to return to Kraków before May 12, 1575. But Henry was crowned king Henry III of France in Rheims in February 1575.[1]

In May 1575, Polish nobility gathered at Stężyca, but no decision was taken. Internal conflict between pro- and anti–Habsburg factions deepened, while southeastern provinces of Red Ruthenia and Podolia were raided by Crimean Tatars, who captured thousands of people. Finally, with support of Senate, the Primate officially declared interregnum.

Before the 1576 Polish–Lithuanian royal election a congress of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania's nobles was held on 20 April 1576 in Grodno which adopted an Universal, signed by the participating high-ranking Lithuanian officials and nobles, which announced that if the delegates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania will feel pressure from the Poles in the Election sejm, the Lithuanians will not be obliged by an oath of the Union of Lublin and will have the right to select a separate monarch.[2]

Primate Jakub Uchanski summoned the Convocation Sejm to Warsaw on October 3, 1575. The date of royal election was set for November 7. Pro-French and pro-Habsburg faction, which consisted of most senators, Roman Catholic clergy (including Uchanski himself), Protestants, Prussian cities and Lithuanians supported Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Also, envoys of the Spanish Empire supported Habsburg faction (although preferred the younger and ultra-Catholic Archduke Ernest of Austria, former Habsburg candidate in 1573, over the older and ""cripto-Protestant"" current Habsburg candidate, Emperor Maximilian) by sending gifts, money and American gold to the electors, wanting to restore the good Poland-Spain relations after the controversy of the Neapolitan sums. They also feared the maintenance of  theFranco-Polish Alliance that, complemented with Franco-Ottoman alliance, could menace Habsburg future victories on Imperial election (and so, isolating Habsburg Spain in Central Europe and Mediterranean Sea) and maybe provoke a European War due to the Valois menace over Balance of power.[3]

Most of Polish szlachta, however, backed an unspecified Piast candidate. As a future king, they saw Jan Zamoyski, John III of Sweden or Prince of Transylvania, Stephen Báthory. Also, envoys of the Ottoman Empire supported either John III or Bathory. Turkish opinion mattered, as the nobility wanted to avoid any military conflicts with such a powerful neighbor.

The Election Sejm began on November 8, 1575, with speeches of envoys of royal candidates. Among Senators, supporters of Maximilian II were in the majority, while among Sejm deputies, there were either supporters of a native, Piast candidate (Jan Zamoyski, Mikołaj Sienicki) or Stephen Báthory (Andrzej Zborowski).

After several heated arguments, on December 12, 1575, Primate Uchanski, under pressure from Papal nuncio Vincenzo Lauro, declared Maximilian II new King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. This was opposed by the nobility, as Uchanski made the declaration without its support. Among Polish szlachta, Stephen Báthory became popular, and, urged by Zamoyski and Teczynski, the nobility decided that Anna Jagiellon should marry Bathory.

On January 18, 1576, supporters of Bathory gathered near Jędrzejów, and in February, they moved to Kraków. Most were members of Ruthenian nobility, there also were influential senators, such as Andrzej Zborowski and Stanisław Karnkowski, also Bishop of Kujawy, Stanislaw Karnkowski. Meanwhile, envoys of Maximilian came to Jędrzejów, urging the nobility to support his son, Archduke Ernest of Austria. Also, Bathory sent his envoy to Jędrzejów, a Protestant nobleman Hieronim Filipowski.

On February 1, the nobility confirmed election of Bathory, and scheduled the coronation for March 4. On February 8, in a Cathedral at Mediaș, Bathory confirmed the pacta conventa, and swore to recover the lands which had been occupied by Ivan the Terrible. Soon afterwards, he began preparing for the journey to Poland. On March 4, Polish envoys sent to Transilvania returned to Kraków, presenting the pacta conventa document signed by Bathory. On April 6, the Transilvanian Duke crossed Polish border, and on April 18, he entered Kraków.

On May 1, 1576, Bishop Karnkowski married Anne Jagiellon to Bathory, and crowned the couple. Since the election was not confirmed by Lithuania, Royal Prussia and Primate Uchanski, Bathory immediately began negotiations, hoping to avoid a civil war. His efforts were fruitful.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1576_Polish–Lithuanian_royal_election

Latvia–Lithuania border,"The Latvia–Lithuania border is the state border between the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania. The length of the land border is 588.1 km (365.4 mi) with additional 22.2 km (13.8 mi) of sea border.[1] It is an internal border of the European Union and the Schengen Zone.

The border starts from the triple junction of the borders with Belarus to the north of Lake Drūkšiai (55°40′50.17″N 26°37′49.79″E﻿ / ﻿55.6806028°N 26.6304972°E﻿ / 55.6806028; 26.6304972)[2] and stretches to the coast of the Baltic Sea, where it ends between Palanga and Rucava. For 30 km (19 mi) the border follows the Šventoji River.

The border started to exist after the Battle of Saule on 22 September 1236 and then was later solidified after the Battle of Durbe on 13 July 1260. There were some disputes on the exact location of the border but these were settled[when?]. Later, for centuries, it was an approximate boundary between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Livonia. Following the Great Northern War and, separately, the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the border became partially defunct when the territories were incorporated into the Russian Empire.

The de facto border was re-established following the independence of both countries in 1918. The Treaty of Latvia-Lithuania border was signed on 30 March 1921 and the land border demarcation was carried out during the 1929–1930. Following the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states, it became an internal state border. The international border was restored in 1991, following the restoration of Lithuanian and Latvian independence. After prolonged negotiations, in July 1999, the border between the territorial waters was drawn as a straight line between 56°04′08.9″N 21°03′51.47″E﻿ / ﻿56.069139°N 21.0642972°E﻿ / 56.069139; 21.0642972 and 56°02′43.5″N 20°42′35.0″E﻿ / ﻿56.045417°N 20.709722°E﻿ / 56.045417; 20.709722.[3]

There were border checkpoints between the countries between 1991 and 2007. They are now abandoned,[4] since both nations joined the Schengen Area in December 2007,[5] allowing unrestricted border crossing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia–Lithuania_border
Treaty of Salynas,"The Treaty of Salynas (German: Frieden von Sallinwerder, Lithuanian: Salyno sutartis) was a peace treaty signed on 12 October 1398 by Vytautas the Great, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Konrad von Jungingen, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. It was signed on an islet of the Neman River, probably between Kulautuva and the mouth of the Nevėžis River.[1] It was the third time, after the Treaty of Königsberg (1384) and Treaty of Lyck (1390), that Vytautas promised Samogitia to the Knights.[1] The territory was important to the Knights as it physically separated the Teutonic Knights in Prussia from its branch in Livonia.[2] It was the first time that the Knights and Vytautas attempted to enforce the cession of Samogitia.[3] However, it did not solve the territorial disputes over Samogitia and they dragged on until the Treaty of Melno in 1422.

When Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, married Jadwiga of Poland and was crowned as King of Poland in 1386, he appointed his unpopular brother Skirgaila as viceroy for Lithuania. Vytautas seized the opportunity to renew his struggle for power and started the Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–1392. He allied himself with the Teutonic Knights, promising them Samogitia. However, Jogaila and Vytautas reconciled in 1392 by signing the Treaty of Astrava. The Knights, betrayed by Vytautas, invaded Lithuania in 1394 and unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius for three weeks.[1] The invaders were driven away by joint Lithuanian and Polish forces, demonstrating that the old raids were no longer effective against the new Polish–Lithuanian alliance.[3] A truce between Vytautas and the Knights was signed in 1396. Vytautas needed to secure his western front as he was planning a massive campaign against the Golden Horde, which resulted in a disaster at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399.[4]

Vytautas' friend and former captive, Marquard von Salzbach, helped to negotiate the agreement. A preliminary treaty was signed on 23 March 1398, in Hrodna; it was finalized in October 1398.[3] According to the treaty Samogitia was ceded to the Knights roughly up to the Nevėžis River, leaving the mouth of Nevėžis in Vytautas' hands. For the first time the Order also received a portion of Sudovia, an almost uninhabited territory north and west of the Šešupė River.[2] The treaty recognized spheres of influence: Veliky Novgorod for Vytautas and Pskov for the Knights.[3] Vytautas also promised to help the Knights build two new castles as compensation for castles he burned in 1392.[1] The Knights promised to help Vytautas in his campaign against the Tatars. The treaty also guaranteed freedom of trade. Sigismund Kęstutaitis and other hostages kept by the Knights since the Civil War were released.[4]

During the week-long celebration following successful negotiations, Lithuanian nobles proclaimed Vytautas as King of Lithuania.[2] While such a declaration had no political force, it was a reply to demands by Jadwiga of Poland to pay Polish taxes.[4] It showed their determination to keep the Grand Duchy of Lithuania separate from the Kingdom of Poland despite the Union of Krewo in 1385.[5] Such a proclamation, known only from the chronicles of Johann von Posilge, raised doubts as to reliability among Polish historians.[3] The treaty is noted among Lithuanian historians as it showed the extent of Vytautas' power in Lithuania: he made territorial concessions without approval from Jogaila, who theoretically was the Supreme Duke of Lithuania.[5]

After signing the treaty, the Order attempted to take control of Samogitia. They took many hostages into Prussia and presented Samogitian nobles with gifts such as wool, salt, and clothes. They also built fortresses – one with Vytautas' help near the Nevėžis River and another (named Friedeburg) near Dubysa.[1] The Knights tried to maintain a friendly relationship with Vytautas, warmly welcoming his wife Anna during her pilgrimage to the tomb of Dorothy of Montau, and sent him gifts.[6] However, disagreements soon arose when the Order demanded the return of about 4000 peasants who had escaped into Lithuania. Vytautas argued that they were free people and had the right to choose where to live.[3] The disagreement grew into a war.

Vytautas renounced the Lithuanian sovereignty over Pskov which had been under Lithuanian influence in the second half of 14th century, and accepted that it was in the Teutonic Order's sphere of influence. This caused Pskov to accept the suzerainty of the Great Duchy of Moscow in 1399.[7]

In March 1401, Vytautas signed the Union of Vilnius and Radom in January 1401.[8] Assured of Polish support, he violated the treaty, supporting a local rebellion of the Samogitians, capturing and burning the two newly built castles. In the fall of 1401 the Knights raided Kaunas and Hrodna; in May 1402 the Samogitians burned Klaipėda.[3] Vytautas joined the conflict in 1402 by attacking Gotteswerder.[1] Jogaila's brother Švitrigaila joined the war on the side of the Teutonic Knights as he had laid claim to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[8] He confirmed the Treaty of Salynas in exchange for Order's military assistance.

Neither side could achieve decisive victory, however, and Vytautas wished to concentrate his attention on troubles in Smolensk, so the Treaty of Raciąż was signed on 22 May 1404.[8] It mirrored the Treaty of Salynas, but did not solve the disputes. The second Samogitian uprising in 1409 resulted in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Salynas
Litvin,"Litvin[a] is a Slavic word for all residents of Lithuania (Slavic: Litva), which was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th–18th centuries, and began to be used no later than the 16th century mostly by the East Slavs.[1] Currently, Litvin or its cognates are used in many European languages for Lithuanians.[b]

In the 16–18th centuries, the term ""Litvin"" was mostly used by East Slavs to refer to all inhabitants of Lithuania, i.e. Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[1][2]

Several authentic sources, surviving from the Middle Ages, with expressed opinion of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania themselves prove that the Lithuanians (founders, rulers of Lithuania from the Gediminids dynasty) were those who spoke Old Lithuanian and originated from the cultural regions of Aukštaitija and Žemaitija, while their Eastern neighbours were Rus' people (Ruthenians):

""We do not know on whose merits or guilt such a decision was made, or with what we have offended Your Lordship so much that Your Lordship has deservedly been directed against us, creating hardship for us everywhere. First of all, you made and announced a decision about the land of Samogitia, which is our inheritance and our homeland from the legal succession of the ancestors and elders. We still own it, it is and has always been the same Lithuanian land, because there is one language and the same inhabitants. Since the land of Samogitia is located lower than the land of Lithuania, it is called as Samogitia, because in Lithuanian it is called lower land [ Žemaitija ]. And the Samogitians call Lithuania as Aukštaitija, that is, from the Samogitian point of view, a higher land. Also, the people of Samogitia have long called themselves as Lithuanians and never as Samogitians, and because of such identity (sic) we do not write about Samogitia in our letter, because everything is one: one country and the same inhabitants.""

""This is the peace made by the Livonian Master and the King of Lithuania and expressed in the following words:(...) Next, a German merchant can travel safely concerning his life and property through Rus' [ Ruthenia ] and Lithuania as far as the King of Lithuania's authority seeks.(...) Next, if something is stolen from a German merchant in Lithuania or Rus', it must be put on trial where it happens; if it happens that a German steals from a Rus [ Ruthenian ] or a Lithuanian, the same way it must be put on trial where it happens.(...) Moreover, if a Lithuanian or a Rus [ Ruthenian ] wants to sue a German for an old thing, he must apply to the person to whom the person is subordinate; the same must be done by a German in Lithuania or Rus'.(...) That peace was made in the one thousand three hundred and thirty-eighth year of the birth of God, on All Saints' Day, with the consent of the Master, the Marshal of the Land and many other nobles, as well as the City Council of Riga; they kissed the cross on the matter; With the consent of the King of Lithuania [ Gediminas ], his sons and all his nobles; they also performed their sacred rites in this matter [ Pagan rites ]; and with the consent of the Bishop of Polotsk [ Gregory ], the Duke of Polotsk [ Narimantas ] and the city, the Duke of Vitebsk [ Algirdas ] and the city of Vitebsk; they all, in approval of the said peace treaty, kissed the cross.""

Litvins are a small ethnic group in the area of the mid-stream Desna River (northern Ukraine).[8] The ethnographic or cultural studies about Litvins are poorly noted and are traced to the beginning of the 18th century.[9] The poet-monk Klymentiy Zinoviyiv [uk] who published several cultural studies noted that Litvins, perhaps after an older pagan tradition, worked on Sundays and rested on Fridays.[9][10] More notes about Litvins were provided at the end of the 18th century by historians of the Russian Empire Afanasiy (Opanas) Shafonsky [uk] and Yakov Markovych [uk].[9] According to Markovych, Litvins are a regional group such as Gascons in France or Swabians in Germany.[9][11]

The name Litvin (Litvyak) owes its origin to political factors and is a demonym (politonym) referencing the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[9] Litvins in the Chernihiv region (Chernihiv Oblast) call themselves Ruski, but not Moskals or Katsaps.[9] They consider the term Litvin to be derogatory.[9] According to the 2001 census, there were 22 Litvins in Ukraine.[12]

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991,[13] the term ""Litvin"" has been adopted by some Belarusian nationalists to claim the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as Belarusian.[14] This is an alternative to the demonym ""Belarusians"" which is derived from White Rus' and, therefore, implies that it is somehow less than the Great Russia.[14] Some Belarusians like Mikola Yermalovich and Viktor Veras (Виктор Верас) claim that the Grand Duchy was Belarusian and that modern Lithuanians are ""historical Samogitians"" (the term Samogitia translates as Lowlands of Lithuania proper) who, despite being ""not Lithuanians"", somehow managed to usurp the name ""Lithuania"" for themselves. In other words, these writers in contrast to Lithuanian linguists claim that modern Belarusians are ""the true Lithuanians"" referred to in historical texts and not ""modern Lithuanians"". This theory is considered fringe and is not accepted by historians.[13][15] During the 2009 census, 66 people identified themselves as Litvins in Belarus.[16]

The Poles still use the words Litwini and Litwa when referring to the Lithuanians and Lithuania respectively.[17][18] While the Belarusians and Belarus are named as Białorusini and Białoruś respectively in Polish.[19][20]

The Ukrainians nowadays refer to Lithuania as Литва (Lytva) in Ukrainian, which is its historic name from the Middle Ages,[21] and to the Lithuanians as Литовці (Lytovtsi).[22][23] The Grand Duchy of Lithuania is called Велике князівство Литовське (Velyke kniazivstvo Lytovske).[24]

Union of Kėdainiai,"The Union of Kėdainiai or Agreement of Kėdainiai (Lithuanian: Kėdainių unija, Swedish: Kėdainiai förbund) was an agreement between magnates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the king of the Swedish Empire, Charles X Gustav, that was signed on 20 October 1655, during the Swedish Deluge of the Second Northern War.[1] In contrast to the Treaty of Kėdainiai of 17 August, which put Lithuania under Swedish protection,[1] the Swedish–Lithuanian union's purpose was to end the Lithuanian union with Poland and to set up the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a protectorate under the Swedish Crown with some of the estates being ruled by the Radziwiłł (Radvila) family.

The agreement was short-lived since the Swedish defeat at the Battles of Warka and Prostki and an uprising organised by the pro-Commonwealth nobility in Poland and Lithuania put an end to Swedish power and to the Radziwiłłs' influence.

The Radziwiłł family owned vast areas of land in Lithuania and Poland, and some of its members were dissatisfied with the role of the magnates, who in Poland–Lithuania theoretically had the same rights as the Polish nobility. Eventually, the interests of the wealthy clan, known as the ""Family"", and the Crown began to drift apart.

Janusz Radziwiłł was the head of the Biržai line of Radziwiłłs and a leader of Lithuanian Protestants. He was a favorite of King Władysław IV, from whom he received the position of Lithuanian Field Hetman, but was an ardent opponent of his brother and successor John Casimir.[2][3] Shortly after his election in 1649, he supported George II Rákóczi's efforts to seize the Polish throne by making a deal with Transylvania. At the same time, he established contacts with Sweden for the first time, seeking to separate Lithuania from the Crown.[2][3] In the following years, Janusz Radziwiłł grew closer to the king, taking part in battles against the Cossacks in Ukraine.[4] He took advantage of his successes by forcing the king to appoint him voivode of Vilnius and grand hetman of Lithuania, thus making him the most important dignitary in Lithuania.[3] However, the king, wanting to limit Radziwiłł's omnipotence, made loyal Wincenty Gosiewski field hetman and treasurer of Lithuania, and divided the Lithuanian army into two divisions.[5][3] In the face of the Russian invasion, Radziwiłł refused to take offensive action and demanded that the king conclude a truce with Moscow and enter into alliance talks with Sweden. At the same time, Radziwiłł re-established contacts with George II Rákóczi urging him to claim the Polish throne and promising his support.[6] The king in turn planned to deprive him of his Hetman's office.[7]

On October 3, 1654, Smolensk, the only major fortress capable of stopping the march of the Russian army deep into Lithuania, fell. At this point Radziwiłł entered into secret talks with Sweden seeking an agreement with them. But as he was still hoping to establish an alliance between the Commonwealth and Sweden, upon hearing of the ongoing negotiations he set out in the spring of 1655 on an expedition deep into Belarus against the Russian army.[8]

In 1654, during the Swedish-Russian invasion of Poland, known as The Deluge, two notable princes of the Radziwiłł clan, Janusz and Bogusław, began negotiations with Swedish King Charles X Gustav that were aimed at dissolving the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Union. In July 1655, Swedish troops crossed the borders of the Commonwealth. The first attack on July 24 was directed at Greater Poland. The Crown army, consisting mostly of pospolite ruszenie and devoid of a commander, capitulated before the Swedes. The capitulation, signed at Ujście, severed the relations of the Greater Poland voivodeships with the rest of the state, which had recognized Charles X Gustav as its ruler.[9] Lithuania was then in turmoil and was being attacked on two separate fronts by Russia and Sweden, and a Ukrainian peasant revolt, known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising, was spilling into the Grand Duchy's southern regions from Ukraine.

Swedish troops also entered Duchy of Livonia capturing Dyneburg on July 17. At the same time, Russian and Cossack armies took offensives approaching Vilnius. The Lithuanian army was few in number. It consisted of three parts: the wojsko zaciężne, the crown reinforcements and the pospolite ruszenie. The crown reinforcements constituted a considerable force of up to 5,000 men. The wojsko zaciężne was of similar size, the size of the pospolite ruszenie is unknown, but it did not represent much military value. In early July, the king ordered the Crown army to leave Lithuania and head for Prussia. This act removed any hope of an effective defense of the Grand Duchy.[10]

In view of this, on July 29, Vilnius voivode Janusz Radziwiłł, Vilnius bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz and Lithuanian equerry Bogusław Radziwiłł called on the Swedish army for help.[11] Swedish troops entered Lithuania essentially as allies.[12] The Lithuanian lords probably knew about the events in Ujście. They placed themselves under the protection of the Swedish king, with no obligation to swear an oath of allegiance or sever ties with the Polish Crown. The proposals envisioned a union of the three states, or only Sweden and Lithuania, if Poland found itself under alien ruler.[11] At the same time, both Radzwills demanded the creation of fiefdoms for themselves, separate from the Grand Duchy, and covering much of its territory, as well as parts of the Crown.[13] Meanwhile, the Swedes also held talks with the Russians, to whom they proposed various lines for dividing the Grand Duchy's territory between them.[14]

Earlier, on August 3, royal secretary Krzysztof Scipio del Campo of Jan Kazimierz arrived in Lithuania, with permission for the Lithuanian lords to enter into truce talks with Moscow and Sweden.[15] The proposals for talks were rejected by the tsarist army, which captured Vilnius on August 9.[16] Part of the army, having received no pay, left the ranks of the army after the fall of Vilnius.[17] On August 10 in Riga, Magnus de la Gardie accepted the Lithuanian terms brought by Gabriel Lubieniecki but not without changes, taking the Grand Duchy under his protection on behalf of the Swedish king. The Lithuanian army was to be attached to the Swedish one, the Grand Duchy was to take on the maintenance of the entire army, the Swedes were to take control of all fortresses. The question of the Grand Duchy's relationship to the Crown and Sweden and the fief principalities for the Radziwiłłs was omitted.[18][19] On August 11, he called on the tsar's commanders to stop further march deep into Lithuania, which is under the protection of the Swedish king.[20]

Lubieniecki returned to Janusz Radziwiłł on August 15, who was not fully satisfied with the negotiated terms, but accepted them. And with him 436 people at the Josvainiai convention, among them field hetman Wincenty Gosiewski, castellan of Samogitia Eustachy Kierdej, and Vilnius canon Jerzy Białłozor.[21] But again conditions were changed, they stipulated the separation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from Sweden, the inviolability of the union with the Crown, joint participation with the Crown in the peace talks, the non-use of Lithuanian troops against Polish ones, only temporary surrender of fortresses, and agreed to a possible union with Sweden, but on an equal basis.[22] On 17 August, Janusz Radziwiłł signed the Treaty of Kėdainiai (Instrumentum Lithuanicae deditionis), which placed the Grand Duchy under Swedish protection.[1][19] The nobility gathered in Braslaw, 116 in number, also approved the act, along with 38 exulants, 3 clergymen and 3 townsmen.[23] A number of lords, however, refused to endorse the act, among them the bishop of Samogitia, Piotr Parczewski, and the starosta of Samogitia, Jerzy Karol Hlebowicz.[23] Similarly, the nobility gathered around Grodno rejected the act of Josvainiai, remaining loyal to John II Casimir.[23] Soldiers who denounced obedience to the hetmans, as well as the nobility of Brest voivodeship, formed a confederation on August 23 in defense of the Fatherland and King John II Casimir in Virbalis, led by voivode of Witebsk Paweł Sapieha.[24]

Eventually, most of the Polish-controlled Lithuanian army surrendered to the Swedes, and the state collapsed. Most of the Crown of Poland, along with west of Lithuania, was occupied by Swedish forces, and the Russians seized most of Lithuania (except Samogitia and parts of Suvalkija and Aukštaitija). The August 17 act was not approved by the Swedes, who did not want war with Moscow, but with the Crown. Nonetheless, the Swedes moved their troops led by Gustaf Adolf Lewenhaupt into the strongholds of Biržai and Radviliškis. On September 17, Bengt Skytte arrived in Kėdainiai. Negotiations on a new treaty began.[25]

Despite the officially proclaimed protection of the Swedish king, the Moscow army continued its march deep into Lithuania, occupying Kaunas (August 16) and Grodno (August 18). Moscow then demanded the renunciation of its claims to Lithuania, in exchange for a guarantee of the inviolability of Courland and Prussia.[26] At the same time, Moscow's deputy Vasily Likhariev arrived in Kėdainiai on August 30, promising to preserve rights, property and religious freedom in exchange for surrender to the tsar.[26] Janusz Radziwiłł rejected these proposals, giving the existing agreement with Sweden as the reason. Field hetman Wincenty Gosiewski was of different opinion, he was ready to make territorial concessions in exchange for the Commonwealth's anti-Swedish alliance with Moscow.[26] Nothing came of the talks, and on September 9 the tsar adopted the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania.[26]

On October 10, Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie arrived in Kėdainiai in an attempt to force the nobility to sign the final agreement. Janusz Radziwiłł's position was becoming weaker and weaker, he himself was constrained by private deals with the Swedes, and he was losing supporters. The Samogitian nobility, gathered in Kėdainiai, formed a confederation manifesting their separateness.[27] Bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz was away in Königsberg, and Bogusław Radziwiłł in his estates in Podlachia. On September 29, 1655, the army loyal to Janusz Radziwiłł, Cyprian Paweł Brzostowski in his letter to Bogusław Radziwiłł estimates at ""under a thousand""; at the time, these were exclusively foreign contingents.[28] Particularly painful for the hetman was the departure from the ranks of his army by the hussar and armoured banners, but these returned to his command later and served him until his death.[29]

On 20 October 1655, Janusz Radziwiłł signed an agreement with the Swedes at his castle at Kėdainiai. According to the treaty, signed by over 1,000 members of the Lithuanian nobility, the Polish–Lithuanian Union was declared null and void. In exchange for military assistance against Russia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania would become a protectorate of Sweden, with a personal union joining both states. In Lithuania, the king was to be represented by his governor (Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, later Bengt Skytte with the title of legate), who did not have to be a citizen of the Grand Duchy. He was to be assisted in governing by deputies, three from each powiat. The armies were to be united, the nobility lost the right to free election and influence over declaring war and making peace. Other rights and religious freedoms were preserved.[27] In addition, The Family would be given two sovereign principalities carved from its lands within the Grand Duchy, and the Lithuanian nobility would retain its liberties and privileges. Janusz Radziwiłł signed a private agreement with the Swedes, under which he received large territorial concessions and revenues; his nephew Bogusław similarly, but on a smaller scale.[30]

The signing of the Kėdainiai Treaty strengthened Swedish rule in Lithuania in the short term and weakened the forces loyal to the Commonwealth and John II Casimir. King John II Casimir, who was staying in Silesia, took Paweł Sapieha's confederates into the pay of the Crown treasury.[31] On September 10, he granted them the traitors' estates in Lithuania. Instead of attempting to join the royal forces, they began plundering Radziwiłł's estates. They then entered into negotiations with Moscow, proposing a truce. This had little effect, and after October 20 Moscow took a further offensive, defeating Sapieha's troops.[32] At the same time, Paweł Sapieha maintained contacts with the Swedes, through the Swedish envoy Jan Fryderyk Sapieha. He eventually accepted the Swedish king's protection on December 5.[32]

Its main proponent, Janusz Radziwiłł, died only two months after it was signed, on 31 December at Tykocin Castle, which was then besieged by forces loyal to the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania, John II Casimir. The castle was soon taken by Paweł Jan Sapieha, who immediately succeeded Janusz Radziwiłł to the office of Grand Hetman of Lithuania.

The tide of the war soon turned and a popular uprising in Poland broke the power of the Swedish army. The Swedish occupation of Lithuania sparked a similar uprising in Lithuania. The Swedish defeat and the eventual retreat from the territories of the Commonwealth abruptly ended the plans of Janusz's cousin Bogusław, who lost his army in the Battle of Prostki and died in exile in Königsberg on 31 December 1669.

With the passing of both cousins, the Radziwiłł family fortunes waned. Bogusław became commonly known as Gnida (""Louse"") by his fellow nobles, and Janusz was called Zdrajca (""Traitor""). Their treason against the Commonwealth largely overshadowed the deeds of the next generation's numerous other family members, including Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł (1625–1680), who served faithfully against the Swedes.

Although seen as an act of treason by contemporaries, modern views on the Swedish–Lithuanian accord differ. Some argue that the arrangement with the Swedes was made by Janusz Radziwiłł not out of greed and the political ambition, but rather out of Realpolitik. According to another theory, Janusz Radziwiłł was merely attempting to secure a strong ally against Russia. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lacked the resources to fight a war on two fronts, and the Polish Crown, which now had its own serious problems and could supply only trifling amounts of money and military forces. However, some Lithuanian intellectuals during the National Revival, including Maironis, praised the Lithuanian nobility for trying to secede from Poland and secure the sovereignty of Lithuania.[33] In 1995, Lithuania and Sweden have celebrated the 340th anniversary of the union as a symbol of friendship and historical bonds shared by the two countries.[34]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Kėdainiai
Singing Revolution,"The Singing Revolution[a] was a series of events from 1987 to 1991 that led to the restoration of independence of the three Soviet-occupied Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania at the end of the Cold War.[1][2] The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, Heinz Valk, in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass evening singing demonstrations at the Tallinn Song Festival Grounds.[3]

During World War II, the three Baltic countries were invaded and occupied by the Stalinist Soviet Union in June 1940, and formally annexed into the USSR in August 1940. Following the Nazi German occupation in 1941–1944/45, the three countries were reconquered by the Soviet army in 1944–1945.

In 1985, the last leader of the former Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev introduced glasnost (""openness"") and perestroika (""restructuring""), hoping to stimulate the failing Soviet economy and encourage productivity, particularly in the areas of consumer goods, the liberalisation of cooperative businesses, and growing the service economy. Glasnost rescinded limitations on political freedoms in the Soviet Union, which led to problems for the Soviet central government in retaining control over non-Russian areas, including the occupied Baltic countries.

Hitherto unrecognised issues previously kept secret by the Soviet central government in Moscow were admitted to in public, causing further popular dissatisfaction with the Soviet regime in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Combined with the war in Afghanistan and the nuclear fallout in Chernobyl, grievances were aired in a publicly explosive and politically decisive manner. Estonians were concerned about the demographic threat to their national identity posed by the influx of individuals from foreign ethnic groups to work on such large Soviet development projects as phosphate mining.[4]

Access to Western émigré communities abroad and, particularly in Estonia, informal relations with Finland, and access to Finnish TV showing the Western lifestyle also contributed to widespread dissatisfaction with the Soviet system and provoked mass demonstrations as repression on dissidents, nationalists, religious communities, and ordinary consumers eased substantially towards the end of the 1980s.[citation needed]

Massive demonstrations against the Soviet regime began after widespread liberalisation of the regime failed to take into account national sensitivities. It was hoped by Moscow that the non-Russian nations would remain within the USSR despite the removal of restrictions on freedom of speech and national icons (such as the local pre-1940 flags).[citation needed] However, the situation deteriorated to such an extent that by 1989 there were campaigns aimed at freeing the nations from the Soviet Union altogether.

The Soviet government's plan to excavate phosphorite in the Lääne-Viru county with potentially catastrophic consequences for the environment and society was revealed in February 1987. That started the ""Phosphorite War"", a public environmental campaign.[5] The MRP-AEG group held the Hirvepark meeting in the Old Town of Tallinn at the anniversary of Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1987, demanding to disclose and condemn its secret protocol.[citation needed]

The ""Five Patriotic Songs"" series by Alo Mattiisen premiered at the Tartu Pop Festival in May 1988.[6] In June the Old Town Festival was held in Tallinn, and after the official part of the festival, the participants moved to the Song Festival Grounds and started to sing patriotic songs together spontaneously.[7] The Baltic Way, a human chain of two million people, spanned from Tallinn to Vilnius on 23 August 1989.[8] Mattiisen's ""Five Patriotic Songs"" were performed again at the Rock Summer festival in Tallinn held on 26–28 August 1988.[9] The Song of Estonia festival was held at the Song Festival Grounds on 11 September.[6] Trivimi Velliste, Chairman of the Estonian Heritage Society, first voiced the public ambition to regain independence.[10] The Supreme Soviet of Estonia issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration on 16 November.[8]

The Singing Revolution lasted over four years, with various protests and acts of defiance. The revolution was led by three different groups: the Heritage Society, the Popular Front, and the National Independence Party. The Heritage Society, established in 1987, focused on spreading awareness about Estonia's history to gather support for Estonia's independence from the Soviets. The Popular Front, founded in 1988, wanted to reform Estonia into self-government within a loose confederation of the Soviet Union. The National Independence Party, established in 1988 as well, was more radical than the other two organizations and demanded complete independence from the Soviet Union. [11][12]

In 1991, as the central government in Moscow and the Soviet Army attempted to stop the Estonian progress towards independence, the newly elected legislature of Estonia together with an elected grassroots parliament, Congress of Estonia, proclaimed the restoration of the independent state of Estonia and repudiated Soviet legislation. Large groups of unarmed volunteers went to shield the parliament, radio and TV buildings from any attacks by Soviet troops. Through these actions Estonia regained its independence without any blood shed.[13]

Independence was declared on the late evening of 20 August 1991, after an agreement between different political parties was reached. The next morning Soviet troops, according to Estonian TV, attempted to storm Tallinn TV Tower but were unsuccessful.[14] The Communist hardliners' coup attempt failed amidst mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Moscow led by Boris Yeltsin.[citation needed]

On 22 August 1991, Iceland (independent country since 1944) announced the establishment of diplomatic relations with Estonia, and Iceland thus became the first foreign country to formally recognise the fully restored independence of Estonia in 1991. Today, a plaque commemorating this event is situated on the outside wall of the Foreign Ministry, which is on Islandi väljak 1, or ""Iceland Square 1"". The plaque reads; ""The Republic of Iceland was the first to recognise, on 22 August 1991, the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Estonia"", in Estonian, Icelandic and English.  Some other nations did not recognise the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union.[15][16]

During the second half of the 1980s as Mikhail Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika in the USSR, which rolled back restrictions to freedom in the Soviet Union, aversion to the Soviet regime had grown into the third Latvian National Awakening, which reached its peak in mid-1988.

In 1986, it became widely known to the public that the USSR was planning to build another hydroelectric power plant on Latvia's largest river Daugava, and that a decision had been made to build a metro in Riga.[citation needed] Both of these projects planned by Moscow could have led to the destruction of Latvia's landscape and cultural and historical heritage. In the press journalists urged the public to protest against these decisions. The public reacted immediately, and in response, the Environmental Protection Club was founded on 28 February 1987. During the second half of the 1980s, the Environmental Protection Club became one of the most influential mass movements in the region and began to make demands for the restoration of Latvia's independence.[citation needed]

On 14 June 1987, the anniversary of the 1941 deportations, the human rights group ""Helsinki-86"", which had been founded a year earlier, organized people to place flowers at the Freedom Monument (Latvia's symbol of independence, which was erected in 1935). This is widely cited as the beginning of the National Awakening. However, the Latvian Song and Dance Festival of 1985 also had been sometimes named as such for choirs requesting and performing the song Gaismas pils conducted by Haralds Mednis after the main event. The song, which speaks about the rebirth of a free Latvian nation, usually a staple of the festival, had been removed from the repertoire; the conductor, disliked by Soviet authorities, was sidelined at the closing concert. He was called from his seat by the choir and 'Gaismas pils' was performed, airing live on Riga Television.[17]

On 1 and 2 June 1988, the Writers' Union held a congress during which the democratization of society, Latvia's economic sovereignty, the cessation of immigration from the USSR, the transformation of industry, and the protection of Latvian language rights were discussed by delegates. Over the course of this conference, for the first time in post-war Latvia, the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which had determined Latvia's fate after 1939, was publicly acknowledged.[citation needed]

The congress of the Writers' Union stirred up public opinion and provided an additional stimulus for the general process of national revival.[citation needed]

In the summer of 1988, two of the most important organizations of the revival period began to assemble themselves—the Latvian People's Front and the Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM). Soon afterwards the more radically inclined Citizens' Congress called for complete non-compliance with the representatives of the Soviet regime.[citation needed] All of these organisations had a common goal: the restoration of democracy and independence. On 7 October 1988, there was a mass public demonstration, calling for Latvia's independence and the establishment of a regular judicial order. On 8 and 9 October the first congress of the Latvian People's Front was held. This organization, which attracted 200,000 members, became the main representative of the return to independence.[citation needed]

On 23 August 1989, the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the People's Fronts of all three Baltic countries held a huge demonstration of unity—the ""Baltic Way"". A 600-kilometre-long (373 mi) human ""chain"" from Tallinn through Riga to Vilnius was assembled. This was a symbolic demonstration of the people's call for independence from the Soviet Union.

New elections to the Supreme Soviet took place on 18 March 1990, in which the supporters of independence gained a victory. On 4 May 1990, the new Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted a motion, ""Declaration of Independence"", which called for the restoration of the inter-war Latvian state and the 1922 Constitution.

In January 1991, however, pro-communist political forces attempted to restore Soviet power. With the use of force, attempts were made to overthrow the new assembly. Latvian demonstrators managed to stop the Soviet troops from re-occupying strategic positions, and these events are known as the ""Days of the Barricades"".

On 19 August 1991, an unsuccessful attempt at a coup d'état took place in Moscow when a small group of prominent Soviet functionaries failed to regain power due to large pro-democracy demonstrations in Russia. This event resulted in Latvia swiftly moving toward independence. After the coup's failure, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Republic announced on 21 August 1991, that the transition period to full independence declared on 4 May 1990 had come to an end. Therefore, Latvia was proclaimed a fully independent nation whose judicial foundation stemmed back to the statehood that existed before the occupation on 17 June 1940.

Between 1956 and 1987, open public resistance to the Soviet regime was rare. It became more persistent in the 1970s and 1980s. One example of this could be the Kaunas events of 1972. Many popular singers often used the poetry of nationalist poets such as Bernardas Brazdžionis or Justinas Marcinkevičius, as the lyrics of their songs. In 1987 the Rock March also promoted awareness of the issue among the people.[citation needed]

In 1987, various organisations (mainly environmental ones) were founded. On 3 June 1988, the Sąjūdis, a political and social movement, was established. Some initiators of this movement were active members of environmental organisations, established in 1987 (e.g. Zigmas Vaišvila, Gintaras Songaila). Initially, this organisation supported the regime, but in early autumn of the same year after Lithuania-wide growth, it became an opposing force to the CPL.

In response to this, Sąjūdis became a more centralised organisation. The active nationalist opposition (mostly the Lithuanian Liberty League) towards the regime culminated in various public protests. The most notorious of them took place on 28 October 1988, which ended up with violent dispersal. The resulting public anger caused resignations in the Communist Party of Lithuania (including the then-First Secretary of the party, Ringaudas Songaila, who served just over a year) and replaced them with more moderate members.[18]

As the CPL leadership changed, it decided to return Vilnius Cathedral, formerly used as a museum of fine arts, to the Catholic community on 21 October 1988. The national anthem of Lithuania and the traditional national Tricolore were legalised in Lithuania on 18 November 1988, officially replacing the flag and the anthem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was followed by the recognition of the Lithuanian language as a state language, what meant that it became the sole legal language on an institutional level.[19] The latter change was instrumental in the removal of some officials (e.g. Nikolai Mitkin, who served as the Second Secretary of the CPL), but fueled tensions in Polish and Russian speaking communities.

It was followed by the gradual rebuilding of national symbols, which included erecting or restoring independence monuments throughout the country in late 1988 and 1989.

During 1989, various organisations (e.g. The Writers Union) split from the Soviet ones. Prior to the election of the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union, Sąjūdis media became more restricted, but after the defeat of the CPL (it won just six seats of 42, other seats were won Sąjūdis supported candidates), restrictions were lifted. By the end of the year, the CPL gave up its power monopoly and agreed to hold free elections for Supreme Soviet of Lithuanian SSR in 1990, which it lost.

Five decades after Lithuania was occupied and incorporated into the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first republic to declare its independence from the USSR on 11 March 1990, while Estonia and Latvia declared Soviet rule to have been illegal from the start and since full restoration of independence was not yet feasible, started a period of transition towards independence, culminating with the failure of the August coup. For the same reason, almost all nations in the international community, except Iceland, hesitated to recognise independence for Lithuania until August 1991.[citation needed]

The Soviet military responded harshly. On 13 January 1991, fourteen non-violent protesters in Vilnius died and hundreds were injured defending the Vilnius Television Tower and the Parliament from Soviet assault troops and tanks. Lithuanians refer to the event as Day of the Defenders of Freedom. The discipline and courage of its citizens – linking arms and singing in the face of tanks and armour-piercing bullets – avoided a much greater loss of life and showed the world that Lithuania's citizens were prepared to defend their national independence.[citation needed]

International governments began recognizing Lithuanian independence after the failure of the coup d'état in August 1991.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution

Union of Horodło,"The Union of Horodło or Pact of Horodło was a set of three acts signed in the town of Horodło on 2 October 1413. The first act was signed by Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland, and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The second and third acts were composed by the Polish nobility (szlachta) and Lithuanian boyars, respectively.[1] The union amended the earlier Polish–Lithuanian unions of Krewo and Vilnius–Radom. Politically, Lithuania received more autonomy as, after the death of Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobles could choose another Grand Duke instead of passing the title to Władysław II Jagiełło or his heir. However, culturally, Lithuania and Poland grew closer. Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes. Catholic Lithuanian nobles and church officials were granted equal rights with the Polish nobles and clergy. Forty-seven selected Lithuanian nobles were adopted by Polish families and granted Polish coats of arms. Thus the union signified the beginnings of the Polonization of Lithuanian culture and the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. It was one of the major steps towards the modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania.[2]

Poland and Lithuania had been joined in a personal union since the Union of Krewo of 1385. Both countries were ruled by Władysław II Jagiełło. However, after the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) and the Ostrów Agreement, Vytautas gained the supreme power in Lithuania.[3] The legal basis for Polish–Lithuanian relations was revisited by the Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401, which reiterated de facto Lithuanian independence and de jure Polish supremacy. Vytautas was to be known by the title of Grand Duke (magnus dux) and enjoyed vast power in Lithuania, while technically he was subordinate to Władysław II Jagiełło, 'Supreme Duke' (supremus dux) and King of Poland.[2] The union was signed after Vytautas' army was soundly defeated in the Battle of the Vorskla River and weakened Lithuania was looking for Polish support.[3] Taking advantage of the Lithuanian defeat, the Principality of Smolensk, Veliky Novgorod, and Pskov rebelled against Lithuanian rule, drawing Vytautas into a war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[4] However, within a few years peace was re-established in the east.

In 1409, the second Samogitian uprising against the Teutonic Knights escalated into the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. Joint Polish–Lithuanian forces defeated the Knights in the decisive Battle of Grunwald in 1410. However, the war did not resolve all the disputes and by 1413 Poland–Lithuania was preparing for another war with the Knights (see Hunger War).[2][5] These developments encouraged Poland and Lithuania to review their relationship.

The treaty repeated the indissoluble character of the Polish–Lithuanian union while carefully balancing Polish and Lithuanian interests. The Lithuanians gained more autonomy as they received the right to elect a new Grand Duke after the death of Vytautas.[2] The earlier Union of Vilnius and Radom stipulated that Lithuania would pass to Władysław II Jagiełło or his heir. However, the Lithuanian nobles promised to consult the Polish nobles when choosing a successor to Vytautas. The reverse was also true: the Polish nobles promised to consult with the Lithuanians when electing the next Polish King.[1] The pact contained one of the first mentions of the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish and Lithuanian nobles agreed to hold a joint general sejm to discuss all major matters, but such a sejm did not take place until 1564.[1] Nevertheless, it was a recognition of the political powers of the Lithuanian nobles.[2]

The Lithuanian nobles and clergy were granted equal rights with the Polish nobility and clergy.[6] However, this extended only to Catholics; many Ruthenian nobles, who were Eastern Orthodox, were excluded,[7] however, in 1434, Grand Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis repealed some of the provisions in the Horodło acts that limited the political rights of Orthodox believers. It would take until 1563 till there was full equality between the two confessions.[8] Selected Lithuanian nobles, 47 in total, were adopted into Polish heraldic families and granted Polish coats of arm. This symbolic gesture signified their desire to adopt Western customs and integrate into Western society.[2] Equal rights encouraged cooperation and kinship between Polish and Lithuanian nobles. The influence of Polish culture continued to increase, culminating in the Union of Lublin of 1569.[1]

Another significant resolution was the adoption of Polish administrative divisions and offices like voivode and castellan by Lithuania. The union created the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius, governed by two Lithuanian nobles.[2] Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political, social, and administrative features for another century. Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471, and another five voivodeships were established between 1504 and 1514.[9] This administrative change signified the modernization of the Grand Duchy and a decline of traditional dynastic politics. Previously major regions of the Grand Duchy were ruled by members of the ruling dynasty (siblings, children, cousins, etc. of the Grand Duke). Such principalities remained semi-independent and their rulers could become powerful rivals of the Grand Duke with their own claims to the throne.[9] The new voivodeships were governed by trustworthy nobles, unrelated to the royal clan, who could be easily replaced. Soon the nobility replaced members of the ruling dynasty as the driving force behind Lithuanian politics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Horodło
Kibinai,"Kibinai, kybyn, or kibin (plural in Karaim language: kybynlar / Qıbınlar (Common Turkic Latin); singular in Lithuanian: kibinas) are traditional pastries filled with mutton and onion, popular with the Karaite ethnic minority in Lithuania.[1] As everything Karaite in Lithuania, they are mostly associated with the city of Trakai.[2] English-language travel guides compare them to Cornish pasties.[3]

Princely houses of Poland and Lithuania,"The princely houses of Poland and Lithuania differed from other princely houses in Europe. The Polish and Lithuanian nobility (szlachta) could not be granted noble titles by the King in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as hereditary titles, with some exceptions, were largely forbidden. Therefore, the title of prince either dated to the times before the Union of Lublin, which created the Commonwealth in 1569, or was granted to some nobles (usually magnates) by foreign kings. Due to the longstanding history of common statehood, some noble families often described as ""Polish"" actually originated in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and are of Lithuanian or Ruthenian descent.

These princely houses lived like average rich nobility, but sometimes part of these lived like peasants.[3]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_houses_of_Poland_and_Lithuania
Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Hebrew: קיצור תולדות האנושות, Qitzur Toldot ha-Enoshut) is a book by Yuval Noah Harari, based on a series of lectures he taught at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It was first published in Hebrew in Israel in 2011, and in English in 2014.[1][2] The book focuses on Homo sapiens, and surveys the history of humankind, starting from the Stone Age and going up to the 21st century. The account is situated within a framework that intersects the natural sciences with the social sciences.

Harari's work places human history within a framework, with the natural sciences setting limits for human activity and social sciences shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change.

Harari surveys the history of humankind from the Stone Age up to the 21st century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of H. sapiens into four major parts:[3]

Harari's main argument is that H. sapiens came to dominate the world because they are the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric H. sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals and numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of H. sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money and human rights. He argues that these beliefs give rise to discrimination – whether racial, sexual or political – and it is potentially impossible to have a completely unbiased society. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks and legal institutions – owe their emergence to H. sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction.[4] Accordingly, Harari describes money as a system of mutual trust and political and economic systems as similar to religions.

Harari's key claim regarding the Agricultural Revolution is that while it promoted population growth for H. sapiens and co-evolving species like wheat and cows, it made the lives of most individuals (and animals) worse than they had been when H. sapiens were mostly hunter-gatherers, since their diet and daily lives became significantly less varied. Humans' violent treatment of other animals is a theme that runs throughout the book.

In discussing the unification of humankind, Harari argues that over its history, the trend for H. sapiens has increasingly been towards political and economic interdependence. For centuries, the majority of humans lived in empires, and capitalist globalization is effectively producing one, global empire. Harari argues that money, empires, and universal religions are the principal drivers of this process.

Harari describes the Scientific Revolution as an innovation in European thought, whereby elites became willing to admit to and try to remedy their own ignorance. He describes this as one driver of early modern European imperialism and of the current convergence of human cultures. Harari also claims there is a lack of research into the history of happiness, positing that people today are not significantly happier than in past eras.[5] He concludes by discussing how modern technology may soon end the species by ushering in genetic engineering, immortality, and non-organic life. Harari metaphorically describes humans as deities in that they can create species.

Harari cites Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997) as one of the greatest inspirations for the book.[6]

First published in Hebrew in 2011, the book was later released in English in 2015 and has since been translated into 65 different languages.[7] It made The New York Times best-seller list, appearing for 182 weeks (as of May 2022) including 96 consecutive weeks.[8][9] According to Book Marks, the book received ""positive"" reviews based on 9 critic reviews with 1 being ""rave"" and 5 being ""positive"" and 3 being ""mixed"".[10] The Bookseller reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of ""Top form"", ""Flawed but worth a read"", and ""Disappointing"": Sunday Times and Times reviews under ""Top form"".[11] It won the National Library of China's Wenjin Book Award for the best book published in 2014.[12][13] Writing four years after its English-language publication, Alex Preston wrote in The Guardian that Sapiens had become a ""publishing phenomenon"" with ""wild success"" symptomatic of a broader trend toward ""intelligent, challenging nonfiction, often books that are several years old"".[14] Concurrently, The Guardian listed the book as among the ten ""best brainy books of the decade"".[15] The Royal Society of Biologists in the UK shortlisted the book in its 2015 Book Awards.[16] Bill Gates ranked Sapiens among his ten favorite books,[17] and Mark Zuckerberg also recommended it.[18] Kirkus Reviews awarded a star to the book, noting that it is ""the great debates of history aired out with satisfying vigor"".[19] The British daily The Times also gave the book a rave review, quoting that ""Sapiens is the kind of book that sweeps cobwebs out of your brain"" and that it is ""mind-thrilling"".[20] The Sydney Morning Herald described the book as ""always engaging and often provocative"".[21]

In 2015 the Israel Museum in Jerusalem created a special, temporary exhibit based on the book, using archeological and artistic displays to demonstrate the main themes found in the book. The exhibit ran from May until December 2015.[22]

Discussing the book's success in 2020, Ian Parker writing for The New Yorker said ""the book thrived in an environment of relative critical neglect"" since it received few major reviews at the time of its release. Parker describes Sapiens' extremely broad scope as being a defense against expert criticism. Quoting Harari's academic advisor Steven Gunn, ""Nobody's an expert on the meaning of everything, or the history of everybody, over a long period.""[23] In a 2022 article titled ""The Dangerous Populist Science of Yuval Noah Harari"" for Current Affairs, neuroscientist Darshana Narayanan expanded on The New Yorker's comments: ""I tried my hand at fact-checking Sapiens ... I consulted colleagues in the neuroscience and evolutionary biology community and found that Harari's errors are numerous and substantial, and cannot be dismissed as nit-picking.""[24]

Anthropologist Christopher Robert Hallpike reviewed the book and did not find any ""serious contribution to knowledge"". Hallpike suggested that ""...whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously"". He considered it an infotainment publishing event offering a ""wild intellectual ride across the landscape of history, dotted with sensational displays of speculation, and ending with blood-curdling predictions about human destiny.""[25]

Science journalist Charles C. Mann concluded in The Wall Street Journal, ""There's a whiff of dorm-room bull sessions about the author's stimulating but often unsourced assertions.""[26]

Reviewing the book in The Washington Post, evolutionary anthropologist Avi Tuschman points out problems stemming from the contradiction between Harari's ""freethinking scientific mind"" and his ""fuzzier worldview hobbled by political correctness"", but nonetheless wrote that ""Harari's book is important reading for serious-minded, self-reflective sapiens.""[27]

Reviewing the book in The Guardian, philosopher Galen Strawson concluded that, among several other problems, ""Much of Sapiens is extremely interesting, and it is often well expressed. As one reads on, however, the attractive features of the book are overwhelmed by carelessness, exaggeration and sensationalism"". He specifically mentions how the author ignores happiness studies, that his claims of the ""opening of a gap between the tenets of liberal humanism and the latest findings of the life sciences"" is silly and deplores that the author ""transforms Adam Smith into the apostle of greed"".[28]

The original Hebrew publication was first issued in 2011 as קיצור תולדות האנושות [Ḳitsur toldot ha-enoshut], which translates into A Brief History of Humankind.

A 2012 English translation was self-published with the title From Animals Into Gods. The English translation was published in 2015 as Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, ""translated by the author with the help of John Purcell and Haim Watzman"", simultaneously in London by Harvill Secker ISBN 978-1846558238 (hardback), ISBN 978-1846558245 (trade paperback)[29] and in Canada by Signal (ISBN 978-0-7710-3850-1 (bound), ISBN 978-0-7710-3852-5 (html)). It was then republished in London by Vintage Books in 2015 (ISBN 978-0099590088 (paperback)).

In 2020 the first volume of the graphic novel version of the book was published simultaneously in several languages, with the title Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 1: The Birth of Humankind. It is credited as coauthored by Harari and David Vandermeulen, with adaptation and illustrations by Daniel Casanave. The second volume Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 2: The Pillars of Civilization was published in October 2021.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind
Wartime collaboration in the Baltic states,"Wartime collaboration occurred in every country occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War, including the Baltic states. The three Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, were occupied by the Soviet Union in the summer of 1940, and were later occupied by Germany in the summer of 1941 and then incorporated, together with parts of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union (modern Belarus), into the Reichskommissariat Ostland.[1] Collaborators with Germany participated in the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, as well as in the Holocaust, both in and outside of the Baltic states. This collaboration was done through formal Waffen-SS divisions and police battalions, as well as through spontaneous acts during the opening of the war.

In German plans, Estonia was to become an area for future German settlements, as Estonians themselves were considered high on the Nazi racial scale, with potential for Germanization.[2] Unlike the other Baltic states, the seizure of Estonian territory by German troops was relatively long, from July 7 to December 2, 1941. This period was used by the Soviets to carry out a wave of repression against Estonians. It is estimated that the NKVD's subordinate destruction battalions killed some 2,000 Estonian civilians,[3] and 50–60,000 people were deported deep into the USSR.[4] 10,000 of them died in the GULAG system within a year.[4] Many Estonians fought against Soviet troops on the German side, hoping to liberate their country. Some 12,000 Estonian partisans took part in the fighting.[5] Of great importance were the 57 Finnish-trained members of the Erna group, who operated behind enemy lines.[5]

Resistance groups were organised by Germans in August 1941 into the Omakaitse (lit. 'Self-defence'), which had between 34,000[6] and 40,000 members,[7] mainly based on the Kaitseliit, dissolved by the Soviets.[6] Omakaitse was in charge of clearing the German army's rear of Red Army soldiers, NKVD members, and Communist activists. Within a year its members killed 5,500 Estonian residents.[8] Later, they performed guard duty and fought Soviet partisans flown into Estonia.[8] From among Omakaitse members were recruited Estonian policemen, members of the Estonian Auxiliary Police and officers of the Estonian 20th Waffen-SS Division.[9]

The Germans formed a puppet government, the Estonian Self-Administration, headed by Hjalmar Mäe. This government had considerable autonomy in internal affairs, such as filling police posts.[9] The Security Police in Estonia (SiPo) had a mixed Estonian-German structure (139 Germans and 873 Estonians) and was formally under the Estonian Self-Administration.[10] Estonian police cooperated with Germans in rounding up Jews, Roma, communists and those deemed enemies of existing order or asocial elements. The police also helped to conscript Estonians for forced labor and military service under German command.[11] Most of the small population of Estonian Jews fled  before the Germans arrived, with only about a thousand remaining. All of them were arrested by Estonian police and executed by Omakaitse.[12] Members of the Estonian Auxiliary Police and 20th Waffen-SS Division also executed Jewish prisoners sent to concentration and labor camps established by the Germans on Estonian territory.[13]

Immediately after entering Estonia, the Germans began forming volunteer Estonian units the size of a battalion. By January 1942, six Security Groups (battalions No. 181-186, about 4,000 men) had been formed and were subordinate to the Wehrmacht 18th Army.[14] After the one-year contract expired, some volunteers transferred to the Waffen-SS or returned to civilian life, and three Eastern Battalions (No. 658-660) were formed from those who remained.[14] They fought until early 1944, after which their members transferred to the 20th Waffen-SS Division.[14]

Beginning in September 1941, the SS and police command created four Infantry Defence Battalions (No. 37-40) and a reserve and sapper battalion (No. 41-42), which were operationally subordinate to the Wehrmacht. From 1943 they were called Police Battalions, with 3,000 serving in them.[14] In 1944 they were transformed into two infantry battalions and evacuated to Germany in the fall of 1944, where they were incorporated into the 20th Waffen-SS Division.[14]

In the fall of 1941, the Germans also formed eight police battalions (No. 29-36), of which only Battalion No. 36 had a typically military purpose. However, due to shortages, most of them were sent to the front near Leningrad,[15] and were mostly disbanded in 1943. That same year, the SS and police command created five new Security and Defense Battalions (they inherited No. 29-33 and had more than 2,600 men).[16] In the spring of 1943, five Defence Battalions (No. 286-290) were established as compulsory military service units. The 290th Battalion consisted of Estonian Russians. Battalions No. 286, 288 and 289 were used to fight partisans in Belarus.[17]

On Aug. 28, 1942, the Germans formed the volunteer Estonian Waffen-SS Legion. Of the approximately 1,000 volunteers, 800 were incorporated into Battalion Narva and sent to Ukraine in the spring of 1943.[18] Due to the shrinking number of volunteers, in February 1943 the Germans introduced compulsory conscription in Estonia. Born between 1919 and 1924 faced the choice of going to work in Germany, joining the Waffen-SS or Estonian auxiliary battalions. 5,000 joined the Estonian Waffen-SS Legion, which was reorganized into the 3rd Estonian Waffen-SS Brigade.[17]

As the Red Army advanced, a general mobilization was announced, officially supported by Estonia's last Prime Minister Jüri Uluots. By April 1944, 38,000 Estonians had been drafted. Some went into the 3rd Waffen-SS Brigade, which was enlarged to division size (20th Waffen-SS Division: 10 battalions, more than 15,000 men in the summer of 1944) and also incorporated most of the already existing Estonian units (mostly Eastern Battalions).[19] Younger men were conscripted into other Waffen-SS units. From the rest, six Border Defense Regiments and four Police Fusilier Battalions (Nos. 286, 288, 291, and 292).[20]

The Estonian Security Police and SD,[21] the 286th, 287th and 288th Estonian Auxiliary Police battalions, and 2.5–3% of the Estonian Omakaitse (Home Guard) militia units (between 1,000 and 1,200 men) took part in rounding up, guarding or killing of 400–1,000 Roma and 6,000 Jews in concentration camps in the Pskov region of Russia and the Jägala, Vaivara, Klooga and Lagedi concentration camps in Estonia.

Guarded by these units, 15,000 Soviet POWs died in Estonia: some through neglect and mistreatment and some by execution.[22]

Deportations and murders of Latvians by the Soviet NKVD reached their peak in the days before the capture of Soviet-occupied Riga by German forces.[23] Those that the NKVD could not deport before the Germans arrived were shot at the Central Prison.[23] The RSHA's instructions to their agents to unleash pogroms fell on fertile ground.[23] After the Einsatzkommando 1a and part of Einsatzkommando 2 entered the Latvian capital,[24] Einsatzgruppe A's commander Franz Walter Stahlecker made contact with Viktors Arājs on 1 July and instructed him to set up a commando unit. It was later named Latvian Auxiliary Police or Arajs Kommandos.[25] The members, far-right students and former officers were all volunteers, and free to leave at any time.[25]

The next day, 2 July, Stahlecker instructed Arājs to have the Arājs Kommandos unleash pogroms that looked spontaneous,[23] before the German occupation authorities were properly established.[26]  Einsatzkommando-influenced[27] mobs of former members of Pērkonkrusts and other extreme right-wing groups began pillaging and making mass arrests, and killed 300 to 400 Riga Jews. Killings continued under the supervision of SS Brigadeführer Walter Stahlecker, until more than 2,700 Jews had died.[23][26]

The activities of the Einsatzkommando were constrained after the full establishment of the German occupation authority, after which the SS made use of select units of native recruits.[24] German General Wilhelm Ullersperger and Voldemārs Veiss, a well known Latvian nationalist, appealed to the population in a radio address to attack ""internal enemies"". During the next few months, the Latvian Auxiliary Security Police primarily focused on killing Jews, Communists and Red Army stragglers in Latvia and in neighbouring Byelorussia.[25]

In February–March 1943, eight Latvian battalions took part in the punitive anti-partisan Operation Winterzauber near the Belarus–Latvia border, which resulted in 439 burned villages, 10,000 to 12,000 deaths, and over 7,000 taken for forced labor or imprisoned at the Salaspils concentration camp.[28] This group alone killed almost half of Latvia's Jewish population,[29] about 26,000 Jews, mainly in November and December 1941.[30]

The creation of the Arājs Kommando was ""one of the most significant inventions of the early Holocaust"",[29] and marked a transition from German-organised pogroms to systematic killing of Jews by local volunteers (former army officers, policemen, students, and Aizsargi).[26] This helped with a chronic German personnel shortage and provided the Germans with relief from the psychological stress of routinely murdering civilians.[26] By the autumn of 1941, the SS had deployed the Latvian Auxiliary Police battalions to Leningrad, where they were consolidated into the 2nd Latvian SS Infantry Brigade.[31] In 1943, this brigade, which later became the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian), was consolidated with the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian) to become the Latvian Legion.[31] Although the Latvian Legion was a formally volunteer Waffen-SS unit, it was voluntary only in name; approximately 80–85% of its men were conscripts.[32]

Prior to the German invasion, some leaders in Lithuania and in exile believed Germany would grant the country autonomy, as they had the Slovak Republic. The German intelligence service Abwehr believed that it controlled the Lithuanian Activist Front, a pro-German organization based at the Lithuanian embassy in Berlin.[33]  Lithuanians formed the Provisional Government of Lithuania on their own initiative, but Germany did not recognize it diplomatically, or allow Lithuanian ambassador Kazys Škirpa to become prime minister, instead actively thwarting his activities. The provisional government disbanded, since it had no power and it had become clear that the Germans came as occupiers not liberators from Soviet occupation, as initially thought.

Units under Algirdas Klimaitis and supervised by SS Brigadeführer Walter Stahlecker started pogroms in and around Kaunas on 25 June 1941.[34][35] Lithuanian collaborators killed hundreds of thousands of Jews, Poles and Gypsies.[36] According to Lithuanian-American scholar Saulius Sužiedėlis, an  increasingly antisemitic atmosphere clouded Lithuanian society, and antisemitic LAF émigrés ""needed little prodding from 'foreign influences'"".[37] He concluded that Lithuanian collaboration was ""a significant help in facilitating all phases of the genocidal program . . . [and that] the local administration contributed, at times with zeal, to the destruction of Lithuanian Jewry"".[38] Elsewhere, Sužiedėlis similarly emphasised that Lithuania's ""moral and political leadership failed in 1941, and that thousands of Lithuanians participated in the Holocaust"",[39] though he warned that ""[u]ntil buttressed by reliable accounts providing time, place and at least an approximate number of victims, claims of large-scale pogroms before the advent of the German forces must be treated with caution"".[40]

In 1941, the Lithuanian Security Police was created, subordinate to Nazi Germany's Security Police and Criminal Police.[41] Of the 26 Lithuanian Auxiliary Police Battalions, 10 were involved in the Holocaust.[clarification needed] On August 16, the head of the Lithuanian police, Vytautas Reivytis [lt], ordered the arrest of Jewish men and women with Bolshevik activities: ""In reality, it was a sign to kill everyone.""[42] The Special SD and German Security Police Squad in Vilnius killed 70,000 Jews in Paneriai and other places.[41][clarification needed] In Minsk, the 2nd Battalion shot about 9,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and in Slutsk it massacred 5,000 Jews.

In March 1942, in Poland, the 2nd Lithuanian Battalion guarded the Majdanek concentration camp.[43] In July 1942, the 2nd Battalion participated in the deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka extermination camp.[44] In August–October 1942, some of the Lithuanian police battalions were in Belarus and Ukraine: the 3rd in Molodechno, the 4th in Donetsk, the 7th in Vinnytsa, the 11th in Korosten, the 16th in Dnepropetrovsk, the 254th in Poltava and the 255th in Mogilev (Belarus).[45][unreliable source?] One battalion was also used to put down the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.[43]

The participation of the local populace was a key factor in the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Lithuania[46] which resulted in the near total decimation of Lithuanian Jews living in the Nazi-occupied Lithuanian territories that would. From 25 July 1941, participation was under the Generalbezirk Litauen of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Out of approximately 210,000[47] Jews, (208,000 according to the Lithuanian pre-war statistical data)[48] an estimated 195,000–196,000 perished before the end of World War II (wider estimates are sometimes published); most from June to December 1941.[47][49] The events happening in the USSR's western regions occupied by Nazi Germany in the first weeks after the German invasion (including Lithuania – see map) marked the sharp intensification of the Holocaust.[50][51][52]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_collaboration_in_the_Baltic_states
Lithuanian Regions Party,"The Lithuanian Regions Party (Lithuanian: Lietuvos regionų partija, LRP),[3] also translated as the Lithuanian Party of Regions, is a political party in Lithuania.[4] It was founded in 2018 as the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos socialdemokratų darbo partija, LSDDP) following a split of members from Social Democratic Party of Lithuania (LSDP; also joined by former members of the Labour Party) after the LSDP's decision to exit a coalition government with the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union in 2017.[5]

The party was a junior partner in government in the Seimas, Lithuania's unicameral Parliament, from 2018[6] to 2020. At the time, the LSDDP had 50 sections.[7]

The party scored badly in the 2019 European Parliament election, scoring only 2.4% of votes and failing to elect any MEP. The party won slightly over 3% of the popular vote and 3 seats in the 2020 parliamentary election (only one MP, Andrius Palionis, was reelected). By this, the party became eligible to state dotation, but it was not allowed to form a separate parliamentary group, as a minimum of seven MPs are required for its formation. To do so, the LSDDP aligned with the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, Freedom and Justice (formerly Order and Justice) and independent right-wing deputies Petras Gražulis and Valdemaras Valkiūnas [lt] to form the Lithuanian Group of Regions (Lithuanian: Lietuvos regionų frakcija).

In July 2021, the party adopted the name Lithuanian Regions Party. Jonas Pinskus, a former member of the Labour Party who joined the LSDDP in 2018, was elected chairman. He emphasized taking the party to a regionalist direction and emphasized growing differences between the Regions Party and LSDP.[8]

Pinskus' wife and Mayor of Širvintos, Živilė Pinskuvienė, joined the Regions Party alongside her electoral committee ""Živilė Pinskuvienė's team – for a successful Širvintos region"" (Lithuanian: Živilės Pinskuvienės komanda – už sėkmingą Širvintų kraštą) in 2022.[9] The Regions Party gained 73% of the vote in Širvintos in the 2023 Lithuanian local elections,[10] the only municipality in which the party earned the largest share of the vote.

In its party program, the Regions Party describes itself as a centre-left political party.[11] Political science journals, such as Geographia Polonica and the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, classified the party as left-wing.[2] It supports decentralization of the political system, a social market economy, and a stronger social safety net but at the same time supports the formation of additional free economic zones in poorer Lithuanian regions. It opposes further European integration. The Regions Party is a supporter of the right-wing, anti-LGBT, and traditionalist Lithuanian Family Movement, and participates in their protests and demonstrations.[12] It initiated an attempt to ban ""LGBT propaganda"" in the Prienai District Municipality in 2023; this proposal did not receive support from the local council.[13] Six of their original deputies were part of the similarly named post-communist Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP).[14][15]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Regions_Party
History of Warsaw,"The history of Warsaw spans over 1400 years. In that time, the city evolved from a cluster of villages to the capital of a major European power, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth—and, under the patronage of its kings, a center of enlightenment and otherwise unknown tolerance. Fortified settlements founded in the 9th century form the core of the city, in today's Warsaw Old Town.

The city has had a particularly tumultuous history for a European city. It experienced numerous plagues, invasions, and devastating fires. The most destructive events include the Deluge, the Great Northern War (1702, 1704, 1705), War of the Polish Succession, Warsaw Uprising (1794), Battle of Praga and the Massacre of Praga inhabitants, November Uprising, January Uprising, World War I, Siege of Warsaw (1939) and aerial bombardment—and the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Warsaw Uprising (after which the German occupiers razed the city).

The city has hosted many crucial events in the history of Poland. It was the site of election of Polish kings, meeting of Polish parliament (Sejm), and events such as the Polish victory over the Bolsheviks at the Vistula, during the Battle of Warsaw (1920). In recent years the history-laden city has grown to become the multicultural capital of a modern European state and a major commercial and cultural centre of Central Europe.

The first fortified settlements on the site of today's Warsaw were Bródno (9th or 10th century), Kamion (11th century) and Jazdów (12th or 13th century).[1] Bródno was a small settlement in the north-eastern part of today's Warsaw, burned about 1040 during the uprising of Miecław, one of the Mazovian local princes. Kamion was established about 1065 close to the today's Warszawa Wschodnia station (today, Kamionek estate), Jazdów—before 1250 by the today's Sejm. Jazdów was raided twice—in 1262 by Lithuanians, in 1281 by the Płock Prince Bolesław II of Masovia. Then, a new similar settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called Warszowa, c. 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) north of Jazdów—by the same Prince Bolesław II. The Bolesław's brother and successor, Konrad II, built a wooden castellan, which was burned—again by the Lithuanians. On this place, the prince ordered the building of a brick church, which obtained the name of St. John and became a cathedral.

The first historical document attesting to the existence of a Warsaw castellan dates to 1313.[3] Fuller information about the age of the city is contained in the court case against the Teutonic Knights, which took place in Warsaw cathedral in 1339.[3] In the beginning of the 14th century it became one of the seats of the Dukes of Masovia, becoming the capital of Masovia in 1413 (Prince Janusz II).[1] Warsaw's economy of the 14th century rested on crafts and trade. The townsmen, of uniform nationality at the time, were marked by a great disparity in their financial status.[3] At the top were the rich patricians while the plebeians formed the lower strata.[3]

At that time, Warsaw housed about 4500 people. In the 15th century, the town spread beyond the northern town wall, and a settlement, New Town, began. The existing settlement became known as Old Town. Each had its own town charter and government. The aim of establishing a new town was to regulate the settling of new people who weren't allowed to settle in Old Town (mainly Jews).[4]

In 1515, during the Muscovy-Lithuanian War, fire (probably lit by Russian agents) burned a large part of Old Warsaw.[5] Gross social inequality and wealth disparity led in 1525 to the first revolt of the poor of Warsaw against the rich and their abuse of power.[3] This struggle resulted in the so-called third order being added to the city's authorities, sharing power with the two bodies controlled by the patrician class: the council and the assessors.[3] The story of Warsaw's struggle for social liberation dates from this time.[3]

Upon the extinction of the local ducal line, the duchy was reincorporated into the Polish Crown in 1526 (according to gossip, the last Mazovian prince, Janusz III, was poisoned on the orders of the Polish queen, Bona Sforza, and King Sigismund I).[1]

In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of the General Sejm, where it has remained ever since.[1] To house the Sejm, an Italian architect, Giovanni di Quadro, was contracted to rebuild the King's Castle in the Renaissance style. The incorporation of Mazovia into the Polish Crown led to fast economic development, as illustrated by the rapid growth of the population to 20,000 people compared to c. 4500 people a century earlier.[4]

However, by 1575 (when Stephen Báthory became the Polish king), assemblies were held in another Warsovian suburb at Wielka Wola (now the city's western district, Wola). The stormiest elections were those of 1575 and 1587, when matters came to blows between the divided nobles. Following an election, the king-elect was obliged to sign the pacta conventa (Latin: ""agreed accords""), laundry lists of campaign promises, seldom fulfilled, with his noble electors. The agreements included ""King Henry's Articles"" (artykuły henrykowskie), first imposed on Prince Henri de Valois (in Polish, Henryk Walezy) at the outset of his brief reign (upon the death of his brother, French King Charles IX, Henri de Valois fled Poland by night to claim the French throne).

Due to its central location between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Kraków and Vilnius, as well as its relative closeness to Gdańsk, from where Sweden was always threatening, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and at the same time of the Polish Crown in 1596, when King Sigismund III Vasa moved the court from Kraków.[1] The King's decision had been brought forward by the fire of Cracovian Wawel Castle. The royal architect, Santa Gucci, started to rebuild the Warsovian Castle in the Baroque style, so the King only lived there temporarily, but in 1611 he moved there for good. At the time of Warsaw's transformation from one of the main Polish towns into the country's capital, it already numbered some 14,000 inhabitants. The old walled city had 169 houses; the new Warsaw outside the walls numbered 204 houses, while the suburbs had as many as 320.[3] In 1576, the first permanent bridge was built on the Vistula; it was destroyed in 1603 by an ice floe and until 1775 there was no permanent connection between Warsaw and Praga on the Vistula's right bank.

In the following years, the town expanded into the suburbs. Several private independent districts were established, the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which were ruled by their own laws. Such districts were called jurydyka. They were settled by craftsmen and tradesmen.[3] One of these “jurydykas” was Praga, which granted a city charter in 1648. The peak of their development came in the wake of Warsaw's revival after the Swedish invasion, which had seriously ravaged the city.[3] Three times between 1655 and 1658 the city was under siege and three times it was taken and pillaged by the Swedish, Brandenburgian and Transylvanian forces.[1][6] They stole many valuable books, pictures, sculptures and other works of art - mainly, the Swedish troops. The mid-17th-century architecture of the Old and New Towns survived until Nazi invasion.[3] The style was late Renaissance with Gothic ground floors preserved from the fire of 1607.[3] In the 17th and early part of the 18th century, during the rule of the great nobles oligarchy, magnificent Baroque residences rose all around Warsaw.[3] In 1677, King John III Sobieski started to build his Baroque residence in Wilanów, a village c. 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) south of Old Town.

In 1647, benefiting from Poland's tolerance, Valerianus Magnus publicly performed a vacuum experiment (Torricelli's experiment), which contradicted official European science.

In the 17th century, Warsaw became a significant destination for the migration of Armenians, Scots, and Italians, including from other parts of Poland. It was one of the largest Italian and Scottish communities in Poland,[7][8] and in 1691 Scottish immigrant Alexander Chalmers was even elected mayor of the Old Town. Since 1672, the Armenian community of Warsaw gained importance and grew, as many Armenians fled there from Podolia during the Polish–Ottoman War of 1672–1676.[9] Warsaw has become the most important center of Armenians in Poland outside the area of their main settlement in southeastern Poland. Four Polish Armenians were mayors of the Old Town.[9] In the 18th century, there was an Armenian Catholic chapel at the St. John's Collegiate Church.[10]

A number of political circumstances ensured that after the death of King John III's, Poland–Lithuania entered into a period of decline relative to the other powers of Europe. A new king, the Saxon Prince-Elector Frederic Augustus was elected in 1697, who took the name Augustus II. The new monarch was more concerned with the fortunes of his mother country, the Electorate of Saxony, than of Poland. At the same time, the Polish gentry began to intensively fight for their own rights against the Crown with less thought for maintaining the kingdom's position obtained in the 17th century. Moreover, the rulers of the neighboring Russian Empire (Peter I the Great) and Swedish Empire (Charles XII) were gradually extending their territories and strengthening their power. In 1700, the Great Northern War broke out between these two states; Augustus II recklessly joined it on Peter I's side. The decentralized Polish Crown lacked sufficient power to assert itself in the Great Northern War, which led to Poland to becoming a battlefield between the two neighbouring kingdoms. Warsaw was besieged several times; the first time, in 1702, by Swedish Army troops.[11] The city suffered severely from the Swedish occupation. Under the Swedish influence, in June 1704 the Polish gentry dethroned Augustus II and at Wielka Wola elected a new king, the pro-Swedish Poznań Voivod Stanisław Leszczyński.[11] Shortly afterwards, the tides of war changed and on September 1, 1704, Warsaw was retaken by the Saxon army of Augustus II after five days of a severe artillery bombardment.[12][13] Augustus in turn lost Warsaw after being defeated in a battle fought on 31 July 1705. In this action, which took place between today's Warszawa Zachodnia station and Wielka Wola, 2,000 Swedish troops defeated 10,000 soldiers of the Polish-Lithuanian-Saxon army Only now Stanisław Leszczyński could be officially crowned, which took place in October of that year. In 1707, by virtue of the peace treaty between Augustus II and Charles XII, Imperial Russian Army troops entered Warsaw. After two months, Russian forces were removed from Warsaw. Several times during the Northern war the city was obliged to pay heavy contributions. Leszczyński reigned until 1709, when Russia defeated Sweden in the Battle of Poltava, forcing the Swedish army to leave Poland. Following the Swedish defeat, Augustus II once again became the King of Poland.[12][13] From 1713 onwards, the Russian and Saxon troops were permanently stationed in Warsaw, which led to an oppressive occupation. Besides the tribulations of war, Warsaw was hit by pest (1708), flood (1713) and poor crops.

Augustus II died in February 1733. In September, the Polish gentry again elected as King Stanisław Leszczyński, but it did not matched the political interests of Austria and Russia, which, one month later, forced the Sejm to elect the Augustus II's son, Augustus III. Conflicts of interests between the Leszczyński camp and its patrons Sweden and France and the followers of Augustus III and his patrons Russia and Austria led to the War of the Polish Succession, where Poland again was not more than a battlefield; Warsaw again suffered marches and occupations. As a result of the war, Augustus III remained king and Leszczyński fled to France. Despite the political weakness of the state, the Saxon period was the time of development for Warsaw. The Saxon kings brought many German architects, who rebuilt Warsaw in the style similar to Dresden. In 1747 the Załuski Library was established in Warsaw by Józef Andrzej Załuski and his brother, Andrzej Stanisław Załuski. It was considered to be the first Polish public library[14] and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world.[15] In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries, which could pride themselves on having such a vast book collection.[16] The library initially had about 200,000 items, which grew to about 400,000 printed items, maps and manuscripts[15][17] by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens.

In 1740 Stanisław Konarski, a Catholic priest, founded Collegium Nobilium, a university for noblemen's sons, which is the predecessor of the University of Warsaw. In 1742, the City Committee was established, which was responsible for building of pavements and sewage system. But large parts of the greater Warsaw urban area remained out of control of the municipal authorities. Only in the 1760s did the entire Warsaw urban area come under one administration, thanks to efforts of the future President Jan Dekert (in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called Presidents). Before, the greater Warsaw urban area was divided into 7 districts.[4]

In 1764, a new Polish king was elected, the pro-Russian Stanisław August Poniatowski. Poland became practically a Russian protectorate after his election. In 1772, the First Partition of Poland took place. Polish historians state that the partition was the necessary shock for the Polish gentry to “wake up” and start to think about the future of the country. Owing to the reforming mood, the Enlightenment excised massive influence in Poland and along with it, new ideas of the improvement of Poland. In 1765, the King established Korpus Kadetów, the first secular school in Warsaw. Despite its name, it was not a military school. In 1773, the first ministry of education in the world came into existence: the Commission of National Education (Komisja Edukacji Narodowej).[citation needed] In 1775, a new bridge on the Vistula was built, which lasted until 1794.

This time marked a new and characteristic stage in the development of Warsaw.[3] It turned into an early-capitalistic principal city. The growth of political activity, development of progressive ideas, political and economic changes – all this exercised an impact on the formation of the city whose architecture began to reflect the contemporary aspirations and trends.[3] Factories developed, the number of workers increased, the class of merchants, industrialists and financiers expanded.[3] At the same time there was a large-scale migration of peasants to Warsaw.[3] In 1792, Warsaw had 115,000 inhabitants as compared with 24,000 in 1754.[3] These changes brought about the development of the building trade. Noblemen put up new residences, and the middle class built houses that showed a marked social differentiation.[3] The residences of the representatives of the wealthiest stratum – the big merchants and bankers – matched those of the magnates.[3] A new type of city dwellings developed, catering to the needs and tastes of the bourgeoisie. The artistic medium for all these buildings was that of antiquity, which, although its different social origin was not analyzed at the time, expressed the progressive ideas of the Enlightenment.[3]

In 1788, the Sejm gathered to discuss the ways to improve the political situation and to regain the full independence. As Poland was more or less a de facto Russian protectorate, the Empress Catherine II had to give permission for session. Catherine had no objection because she did not foresee any danger, and besides she needed a Polish help in the war against Turkey. But as the result the Sejm in Warsaw (called Great because of the duration of the session) passed the Constitution of May 3, 1791, which the British historian Norman Davies calls ""the first constitution of its kind in Europe"".[18] It was adopted as a ""Government Act"" (Polish: Ustawa rządowa) on that date by the Sejm (parliament) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was in effect for only a year. The Russo-Turkish War had finished and Empress Catherine could turn her attention to Polish affairs. The result was the Second Partition of Poland of 1793, which in turn led to the 1794 Warsaw Uprising. It was an insurrection by the city's populace early in the Kościuszko Uprising. Supported by the Polish Army, it aimed to throw off Russian control of the Polish capital. The uprising began on April 17, 1794, soon after Tadeusz Kościuszko's victory at Racławice.

After the Battle of Maciejowice General Tadeusz Kościuszko was captured by the Russians. The internal struggle for power in Warsaw and the demoralisation of the city's population prevented General Józef Zajączek from finishing the fortifications surrounding the city both from the east and from the west. At the same time the Russians were making their way towards the city. The Russian forces reached the east outskirts of Warsaw on November 3, 1794. The heavy fighting lasted for four hours and resulted in a complete defeat of the Polish forces. Only a small part managed to evade encirclement and retreated to the other side of the river across a bridge; hundreds of soldiers and civilians fell from a bridge and drowned in the process. After the battle ended, the Russian troops, against the orders given by General Alexander Suvorov before the battle, started to loot and burn the entire borough of Warsaw (allegedly in revenge for the slaughter or capture of over half the Russian Garrison in Warsaw[19] during the Warsaw Uprising in April 1794, when about 2,000 Russian soldiers died[20]). Almost all of the area was pillaged, burnt to the ground and many inhabitants of the Praga district were murdered. The exact death toll of that day remains unknown, yet it is estimated up to 20,000 men, women and children were killed.[21] In Polish history and tradition, these events are called “slaughter of Praga”. A British envoy, William Gardiner, wrote to British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger that “the attack on the Praga's lines of defense was accompanied by the most gruesome and totally unnecessary barbarousness”.[22]

After the fall of Kościuszko Uprising, The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was finally divided between the three neighbors (the 3rd partition, 1795): Russia, Prussia and Austria. Warsaw found itself in the Prussian part and became the capital of South Prussia.

Another result of the Great Sejm works directly concerned Warsaw: on 21 April 1791 it passed the City Act, which cancelled jurydykas. Since that time, Warsaw and its former jurydykas have constituted a homogeneous urban organism under one administration. As a memento of this event, April 21 is celebrated as the Warsaw Day.

Warsaw remained the capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1795, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia to become the capital of the province of South Prussia. Liberated by Napoleon's army in 1806, Warsaw was made the capital of the newly created Duchy of Warsaw.[1] Following the Congress of Vienna of 1815, Warsaw became the center of Congress Poland, a constitutional monarchy under personal union with Imperial Russia.[1] During this period under the rule of the relatively liberal Russian Emperor Alexander I, Warsaw experienced much growth such as the founding of the Royal University of Warsaw (1816). What is today's main street of the city—Aleje Jerozolimskie—was marked out. In 1818, the Town Hall on the Old Town Market was pulled down because it had become too small for the city, which had expanded after it incorporated the jurydykas. The city's authorities moved to Jabłonowski's Palace (by the Great Theater), where it stayed until World War II.

Following the repeated violations of the Polish constitution by the Russians (especially after the Alexander I's death, when the reactionary Nicholas I assumed power), the 1830 November Uprising broke out. It started with the assault on Belvedere – the residence of Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, the commander-in-chief of Polish army and de facto viceroy of the Congress Poland, as well as at the Arsenal. The 1830 uprising led to the Polish-Russian war (1831), the greatest battle of which took place on 25 February 1831 in Grochów — a village in the modern northern part of the district, Praga Południe. Because the Polish commanders were stalled, the war ended in defeat, and curtailment of the Kingdom's autonomy.[1] The Emperor established a military administration in Warsaw. An estate of pretty manors on the north of New Town was eradicated and on this place the Citadel was built, a fortress with prison. The Sejm was suspended, the Polish military dissolved, and the university closed.

Growth of railways turned Warsaw into an important railways hub, as lines were opened to Vienna (1848), Saint Petersburg (1862), Bydgoszcz (1862), Terespol (1867), Kovel (1873), Mlava (1877), Kalisz (1902), along with several shorter lines. In 1875 and 1908, two railway bridges were built. In 1864, the first iron road bridge on stone supports, Most Kierbedzia, opened. It was one of the most modern bridges in Europe at the time. Today, the Śląsko-Dąbrowski bridge lies at the same supports. Only then the city's authorities started to rebuild Praga, which was heavily damaged during the Kościuszko's and November Uprisings, as well as by Napoleon's war. In 1862, the university was opened again, in 1898 the Nicholas II Technical Institute (the Warsaw Technical University's predecessor) was established.

Warsaw flourished in the late 19th century under Mayor Sokrates Starynkiewicz (1875–92), a Russian-born general appointed by Tsar Alexander III. Under Starynkiewicz Warsaw saw its first water and sewer systems designed and built by the English engineer William Lindley and his son, William Heerlein Lindley, as well as the expansion and modernization of horsecars, street lighting and gas works.[1] Starynkiewicz also founded the Bródno Cemetery (1884), still one of the biggest European cemeteries. As a remembrance of the President, one of the Warsovian squares bears the name of Starynkiewicz, even though he represented the Russian authorities.

Warsaw's development, however, was accompanied by an intensive assault on Polish national identity. Russian authorities closed Polish schools and built more and more Orthodox churches. These acts were strongly opposed. On 27 February 1861, Russian troops fired on a Warsaw crowd that was protesting Russian rule.[24][25] Five people were killed. On 22 January 1863 a new uprising broke out. The Underground Polish National Government resided in Warsaw during January Uprising in 1863–4.[25] However, this uprising was mainly in the character of guerilla, therefore Warsaw did not distinguish itself in it. But, as a penalty, President Kalikst Witkowski, the Russian general and predecessor of Sokrates Starynkiewicz, constantly imposed tributes on Warsaw. After Cossacks and police fired on demonstrators in January 1905 (Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907), after the St. Petersburg's “bloody Sunday”), strikes broke out throughout Poland. The Alfonse Pogrom, entailing violent attacks on brothels and street fighting, occurred in May 1905.

First Russian Empire Census of 1897 recorded Warsaw's population as 61.7% Polish, 27.1% Jewish, 7.3% Russian, 1.7% German and 2,2% others.[26] According to the 1897 census, Warsaw was the third largest city in the Russian Empire (after Moscow and St. Petersburg), and the largest Polish city located in the Russian partition of Poland.

In 1904, the first power plant was built. The city installed electric street lamps and, in 1908, opened the first electric tram route. In 1910, 1000 arrested strikers were released after the city's streetcar company agreed to consider wage demands.[27] In 1914, a third bridge opened—Most Józefa Poniatowskiego.

By the start of World War I, the Warsaw horse market was considered one of the most important in Europe. This was due in part to Warsaw being amidst good grazing and horse-using regions. The szlachta held notable stock farms.[28]

After nearly one year of fighting on the Eastern Front, on 1 August 1915 the Imperial German Army under August von Mackensen finally entered Warsaw.[29] The Russian army, during its Great Retreat from Poland, demolished all the Warsovian bridges—and the Poniatowski Bridge that had opened 18 months earlier—and took the equipment from the factories, which made the situation in Warsaw much more difficult.

The German authorities, headed by General Hans von Beseler, needed Polish support in the war against Russia, so they tried to appear friendly to the Poles. For example, they reintroduced the right to teach in Polish, and in 1915 they opened the Technical University, Warsaw School of Economics, and Warsaw University of Life Sciences.

However, the most important decision made for city development was to incorporate the suburbs. The Russian authorities hadn't allowed the extension the Warsaw's area, because it was forbidden to cross the double line of forts surrounding the city. For this reason, at the beginning of World War I on the area of today's Śródmieście and the old part of Praga (c. 33 square kilometres (13 sq mi) 750,000 people lived. In April 1916, the Warsaw territory extended to 115 square kilometres (44 sq mi).

In November 1918, the revolution broke out in Germany. On 8 November, German authorities left Warsaw. On 10 November Józef Piłsudski came to the Warsaw-Vienna Station. On 11 November the Regency Council gave him all military authority—and on 14 November, all civil authority. For this reason, 11 November 1918 is celebrated as the beginning of the Poland's independence. Warsaw became the capital of Poland.

The first years of independence were very difficult: war havoc, hyperinflation and the Polish–Soviet War of 1920. In the course of this war, the Battle of Warsaw was fought on the Eastern outskirts of the city, and the capital was successfully defended and the Red Army defeated.[30] Poland stopped, by itself, the full brunt of the Red Army and defeated an idea of the ""export of the revolution.""[31] Unfortunately, the political and military significance of this victory was never fully appreciated by Europeans. According to Lord d’Abernon: The history of contemporary civilization knows no event of greater importance than the Battle of Warsaw, 1920, and none of which the significance is less appreciated.[citation needed] To commemorate these events, 15 August is celebrated in Poland as Polish Army Day.

On 16 December 1922, in the gallery Zachęta, Eligiusz Niewiadomski, a painter with mental disorder, who belonged to the right-wing National Democracy, assassinated the first President of Poland, Gabriel Narutowicz, who had been elected five days earlier by Sejm.

The other event was the May Coup d'État (1926). On 12 May, Marshall Józef Piłsudski, displeased with the situation in Poland, and in particular with the appointment of a new government, arrived in Warsaw from his residence in Sulejówek (a small town east of Warsaw) at the head of the faithful troops. On the Poniatowski Bridge, he talked with the President Stanisław Wojciechowski, who tried unsuccessfully to convince him to give up the action. The next day, the Piłsudski's troops forcibly conquered Warsaw and forced the government and Wojciechowski to resign. During the coup, street fighting killed almost 400 people—mostly civilians who wanted to watch the fighting.[32] The May Coup started the 13-year period of sanation – the authoritarian rules of Piłsudski's camp. Although Piłsudski himself never accepted the office of President (but twice was Prime Minister), always played a preponderant role in Polish political life.

In 1925, there lived 1,000,000 people in Warsaw. In the next 5 years, the city's wealth doubled. It enabled to build new, broad streets as well as a new airport. The first airport, a temporary one, opened in 1921 in the park Pole Mokotowskie. The second, permanent, airport opened in Okęcie, where it remains. The city government worked out plans for a metro, but construction was hampered by the outbreak of World War II. they opened the first radio station, which had a range that covered almost all the Polish territory.

In 1934, the sanation camp suspended the Warsaw's government and appointed Stefan Starzyński President of Warsaw. He was a faithful supporter of sanation—so, at the beginning of his presidency, he expelled all officials attached to his predecessor.[33] He was also an efficient official, however. He stabilized the city budget, fought corruption and bureaucracy, smartened up the city. However, the Poles remember him mainly due to his heroic behavior during the September Campaign.

The first bombs fell on Warsaw already on 1 September 1939, the first day of the Nazi German invasion of Poland. The most important representatives of civil and military administration (along with the Army's Commander-in-Chief, Marshall Edward Rydz-Śmigły) escaped to the Kingdom of Romania, taking with themselves much of the equipment and ammunition intended for the defense of the city. To stop the chaos, Mayor Stefan Starzyński seized full civil power, although he had no entitlement to do this. To prevent public disorder, he appointed the Citizen Guard. All time he supported the people's spirit in radio speeches. On 9 September, the German Army tank divisions attacked Warsaw from south-west, but the defenders (with a lot of civil volunteers) managed to stop them in the Ochota district. The situation was hopeless. The Wehrmacht advanced so many divisions that sooner or later they would conquer the city, all the more so because on 17 September the Soviets invaded east Poland. Three days later the German encirclement around Warsaw closed. On 17 September, the Royal Castle burnt down, then, on 23, the power plant. On 27 September Warsaw surrendered and on 1 October the Germans entered the city. In September 1939, around 31,000 people died, (including 25,000 civilians) and 46,000 were injured (including 20,000 civilians). 10% of the buildings were destroyed.[12] On 27 October, the Germans arrested President Starzyński and deported him to the Dachau concentration camp, and was shot in December of 1939, somewhere in Warsaw or near the surroundings of Warsaw.

During the Second World War, central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a Nazi colonial administration. Nazi Germany planned destruction of the Polish capital before the start of war.[34] On 20 June 1939 while Adolf Hitler was visiting an architectural bureau in Würzburg am Main, his attention was captured by a project of a future German town, Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau.[35] As early as 1939 Hitler approved of a plan known as the Pabst Plan, which envisaged changing Warsaw into a provincial German city.[34] The Germans immediately closed all higher education institutions. Since the first days, the German authorities arrested and executed Poles or took them to the concentration camps. The executions were carried out mainly in the forests around Warsaw (e.g., in Kampinos Forest or Kabaty Woods). Many small monuments on Warsaw streets today commemorate those crimes. Since the beginning of the occupation, the Nazis had organized so-called łapankas. These consisted of the sudden and accurate surrounding of a chosen place (for example, a railway station) and arresting every resident or passerby who happened to be there. in Polish “łapać” means to catch. Such actions were carried out in other occupied European countries, but not on the same scale as in Poland. Arrested people were deported either to concentration camps or forced labor camps in Germany. From 1943, a concentration camp existed also in Warsaw: KL Warschau.

Since October 1940, the Germans had been deporting Warsaw's entire Jewish population (several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city) to the Warsaw Ghetto.[36] They amassed c. 500,000 people on the area of c. 2.6 square kilometres (1.0 sq mi). The occupying Germans caused the deaths of many through executions and hunger (the daily food ration for one Jew was only 183 kcal).[12] Since October 1941, every Jewish resident who had left the Ghetto as well as anyone who had been helping in any way the Ghetto residents (e.g. threw food over the Ghetto wall), had been punished with death.

When the order came to annihilate the Ghetto as part of Hitler's ""Final Solution"" on April 19, 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.[37] Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month.[37] When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, only few managed to escape or hide.[37][38] The commander of Verbrennungs und Vernichtungskommando (""Burning and Destruction Detachments""), Jürgen Stroop, destroyed the Ghetto so completely that even house walls did not remain.

By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward Warsaw.[39] Knowing that Joseph Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize the control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived. Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began.[39]

The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, continued for 63 days, until 2 October. Eventually, the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate.[39] They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled.[39]

The Nazis then essentially demolished Warsaw. Hitler, ignoring the agreed terms of the capitulation, ordered the entire city razed to the ground and the library and museum collections taken to Germany or burned.[39] Monuments and government buildings were blown up by special German troops known as Verbrennungs und Vernichtungskommando (""Burning and Destruction Detachments"").[39] About 85% of the city was destroyed, including the historic Old Town and the Royal Castle.[40] In the uprising, c. 170,000 people died, of which only 16,000 were insurgents. The civilians (c. 650,000) were deported to the transit camp in Pruszków (Durchgangslager Pruszków).

On January 17, 1945, after the beginning of the Red Army's Vistula–Oder Offensive, Soviet troops entered the Warsaw ruins, and liberated the suburbs from German occupation. The Soviet Army swiftly took the city and rapidly advanced towards Łódź, as German forces regrouped at a more westward position. During the German occupation (1939–45) c. 700,000 people died in Warsaw, more than all Americans and British.[41] The material losses were about 45 billion dollars.[42]

In 1945, after the bombing, the revolts, the fighting, and the demolition had ended, most of Warsaw lay in ruins. Next to the remnants of Gothic architecture the ruins of splendid edifices from the time of Congress Poland and ferroconcrete relics of prewar building jutted out of the rubble.[3]

On 17 January 1945, the Soviet troops entered the left[clarification needed] part of Warsaw and on 1 February 1945 proclaimed the Polish People's Republic (de facto proclamation had taken place in Lublin, on 22 July 1944). At once, the Bureau of Capital's Rebuilding was established. The architects who worked for the Bureau, following the ideas of functionalism and supported by the Soviet puppet Communist regime, decided to renew Warsaw in modern style, with large free areas. They demolished many existing buildings and buildings that could have been rebuilt. Not all their ideas came off, however. In 1953, the Old Town and the Royal Route were reconstructed to look like they had before the war (aided by numerous pictures by many artists, including Canaletto). On the other hand, due to the absence of the ""original"" residents, the houses were settled by ""common people""[who?] who often did not maintain the houses properly. The government did not undertake the complicated and expensive rebuilding of the Royal Castle.[citation needed] Almost all of the property was nationalized (see Bierut Decree).

Rebuilding the Old Town was an achievement on a global scale. In 1980, UNESCO appreciated the efforts and inscribed Old Town onto UNESCO's World Heritage list.[43]

Construction of the MDM estate and PKiN especially required demolishing existing buildings. Demolition, however, made it possible to create one of the street plans in Europe, aside from poor road conditions and badly planned crossroads.

In 1951, Warsaw was significantly enlarged again to address the housing shortage: from 118 square kilometres (46 sq mi) to 411 square kilometres (159 sq mi). In 1957, the town Rembertów was incorporated. On the incorporated areas, the city's government ordered the building of mainly large prefabricated housing projects, typical for Eastern Bloc cities.

The Soviet presence, symbolized by the Palace of Culture and Science, turned out to be very acute. Stalinism lasted in Poland until 1956—as in the USSR. The leader (First Secretary) of the Polish United Workers' Party, (PZPR), Bolesław Bierut, suddenly died in Moscow during the 20th Congress of CPSU in March, probably from a heart attack. By October, the new First Secretary, Władysław Gomułka, in a speech during a rally on the square in front of the PKiN supported the regime liberalization (so-called ""thaw""). At first, Gomułka was very popular, because he also had been imprisoned in Stalinist prisons and as he had taken up the office of PZPR's leader, he promised a lot, but the popularity faded quickly. Gomułka was gradually tightening the regime. In January 1968, he forbade the performance of Dziady, a classical drama by Adam Mickiewicz, full of anti-Russian allusions. That was ""the last drop of bitterness"": then students went out on the Warsaw streets and gathered by the monument to Mickiewicz to protest against censorship. The demonstrations spread throughout the country, and the protestors were arrested by police. This time, the students were not supported by workers, but two years later, when in December 1970 the Polish People's Army fired at the protesting people in Gdańsk, Gdynia and Szczecin, those two social groups cooperated—and that helped end Gomułka.

Gomułka was succeeded by Edward Gierek. Compared to the grey Gomułka time, Gierek ruled with a lighter hand. Once in office, Gierek agreed to rebuild the Royal Castle. Gomułka was against this idea until the end of his life, because he was convinced that the Castle was a symbol of the bourgeoisie and feudalism. Rebuilding started in 1971, and finished in 1974—the same year the Trasa Łazienkowska (Łazienkowska Route) was completed. The route and bridge that connect the Warszawa Zachodnia Station area and the Grochów estate—the broad street on the right bank (Praga)—has been named Aleja Stanów Zjednoczonych (The United States Avenue). The next important investments from the Gierek-times are: the Warszawa Centralna station (1975, now the biggest station in Warsaw) and the broad, dual carriageway Warsaw-Katowice, which even now is called ""Gierkówka"" (in a choice of the destination point, pretty significant was the fact that Gierek himself was born in Silesia, in Sosnowiec). But the prosperity of the Gierek-times was grounded on a very fragile foundation: Gierek took out many loans from other countries and did not know how to manage them efficiently, hence from time to time crises and workers' riots recurred. The first, more serious was in 1976, when workers from Radom and Ursus were striking; that latter city bordered on Warsaw from west, and had a large tractor factory. As a penalty, Ursus was incorporated into Warsaw as a part of the district Ochota; Warsaw expanded by 10 square kilometres (3.9 sq mi).

In the crisis of the 1980s and hard time of martial law, John Paul II's visits to his native country in 1979 and 1983 brought support to the budding Solidarity movement and encouraged the growing anti-communist fervor there.[44] In 1979, less than a year after becoming pope, John Paul celebrated Mass in Victory Square in Warsaw and ended his sermon with a call to ""renew the face"" of Poland: Let Thy Spirit descend! Let Thy Spirit descend and renew the face of the land! This land![44] These words were very meaningful for the Polish citizens who understood them as the incentive for the democratic changes.[44]

From February to April 1989, the representatives of the Polish government and ""Solidarity"" were carried on the negotiations at the Round Table in the Namiestnikowski Palace in Warsaw. The result was an agreement of the government to the participation of ""Solidarity"" in the Sejm elections, which were appointed at 4 June. Solidarity won all seats for which it could compete according to the Round Table Agreement. It was the beginning of big changes for all Europe.

After the political transformation, the Sejm passed an act, which reinstated the Warsaw city government (18 May 1990).

In 1995, the Warsaw Metro opened. It had been built since 1983.[45] In 2002, city Wesoła was incorporated into Warsaw[46] and capital of Poland expanded again by another 22.6 square kilometres (8.7 sq mi). In March 2021, plans were announced to add a third line to the city’s metro system, connecting the city centre with the district of Praga-Południe on the right (east) bank of the Vistula river, and later also with Ochota and Mokotów as a major part of a wider “New Opening” project that also included new pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in central parts of Warsaw.[47] On 28 September 2022, three new Warsaw metro stations were opened, increasing the number of Warsaw Metro stations to 36 and its length to 38,3 kilometers.[48] In February 2023, Warsaw’s mayor, Rafał Trzaskowski, announced plans to more than double the size of the city’s metro system by 2050.[49]

With the entry of Poland into the European Union in 2004, Warsaw experienced the biggest economic boom of its history.[50] Another important stimulator of the economy was the European football championship in Poland and Ukraine in 2012. Five matches, including the opening match, took place in Warsaw.[51] The city also hosted the 2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference[52] and the 2016 NATO Summit.[53]

As of August 2022, Warsaw had received around 180,000 refugees from Ukraine, because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The amount means a tenth of the Polish capital’s population of 1.8 million — the largest single group of  Ukrainian refugees anywhere.[54]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Warsaw

Crimean Karaites,"Crimean Karaites or simply Karaites (Crimean Karaim: Кърымкъарайлар, Qrımqaraylar, singular къарай, qaray; Trakai dialect: karajlar, singular karaj; Hebrew: קראי מזרח אירופה; Crimean Tatar: Qaraylar; Yiddish: קרימישע קאַראַיִמער, romanized: krimishe karaimer), also known more broadly as Eastern European Karaites, are a traditionally Turkic-speaking Judaic ethnoreligious group[8][9] native to Crimea.[10][11][12] Nowadays, most Karaim in Eastern Europe speak the dominant local language of their respective regions.[13]

The Karaite religion, known in Eastern Europe as Karaism, split from mainstream Rabbinical Judaism in the 19th and 20th centuries, though differences date back to the 12th century. They have lived alongside Krymchaks.[14] Most Karaites in the region do not consider themselves to be Jews, associating the ethnonym with Rabbinical Jews alone, but rather consider themselves to be descendants of the Khazars, non-Rabbinical Judeans, or other Turkic peoples.[15]

Research into the origins of the Karaites indicates they are of ethnic Jewish origin and are genetically closely related to other Jewish diaspora groups.[16][17] Some researchers believe they originated in Constantinople and later settled in the Byzantine Principality of Theodoro.[18]

A closely related group, the Slavic Karaites, were formally accepted into the Karaite ethnoreligious community of Crimea after the deposition of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917. They are descendants of ethnic Russian Subbotniks.[19][20] However, most Slavs claiming to be Karaites in Eastern Europe are not members of the Karaite ethnoreligious community, and are not accepted as legitimate Karaites.

Turkic-speaking Karaite Jews (in the Crimean Tatar language, Qaraylar) have lived in Crimea for centuries. Most[21][22] modern scientists regard them as descendants of Karaite Jews who settled in Crimea and adopted a Kypchak language. Others[23][vague] view them as descendants of Khazar or Cuman, Kipchak converts to Karaite Judaism. Today, many Crimean Karaites reject ethnic Semitic origins theories and identify as descendants of the Khazars.[24] Some specialists in Khazar history question the Khazar theory of Karaim origins,[25][26] noting the following:

In 19th century Crimea, Karaites began to distinguish themselves from other Jewish groups, sending envoys to the czars to plead for exemptions from harsh anti-Jewish legislation. These entreaties were successful, in large part due to the tsars' wariness of the Talmud, and in 1863 Karaites were granted the same rights as their Christian and Tatar neighbors. Exempted from the Pale of Settlement, later they were considered non-Jews by Nazis. This left the community untouched by the Holocaust, unlike other Turkic-speaking Jews, like the Krymchak Jews that were almost wiped out.[31]

Miller says that Crimean Karaites did not start claiming a distinct identity apart from the Jewish people before the 19th century, and that such leaders as Avraham Firkovich and Sima Babovich encouraged this position to avoid the strong antisemitism of the period.[32]

From the time of the Golden Horde onward, Karaites were present in many towns and villages throughout Crimea and around the Black Sea. During the period of the Crimean Khanate, they had major communities in the towns of Çufut Qale, Sudak, Kefe, and Bakhchysarai.[citation needed]

According to Karaite tradition,[33] Grand Duke Vytautas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania relocated one branch of the Crimean Karaites to Lithuania ordering to build them a town, called today Trakai. There they continued to speak their own language. This legend originally referring to 1218 as the date of relocation contradicts the fact that the Lithuanian dialect of the Karaim language differs significantly from the Crimean one.[34] The Lithuanian Karaites settled primarily in Vilnius and Trakai, as well as in Biržai, Pasvalys, Naujamiestis and Upytė – smaller settlements throughout Lithuania proper.[citation needed]

The Lithuanian Karaites also settled in lands of modern Belarus and Ukraine, which were part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Karaite communities emerged in Halych and Kukeziv (near Lviv) in Galicia, as well as in Lutsk and Derazhne in Volhynia.[35][36][37] Jews (Rabbinites and Karaites) in Lithuanian territory were granted a measure of autonomy under Michel Ezofovich Senior's[38] management. The Trakai Karaim refused to comply, citing differences in faith. Later all Jews, including Karaites,[39] were placed under the authority of the Rabbinite ""Council of Four Lands"" (Vaad)[40] and ""Council of the Land of Lithuania"" taxation (1580–1646). The Yiddish-speaking Rabbinites considered the Turkic-speaking Karaites to be apostates, and kept them in a subordinate and depressed position. The Karaites resented this treatment. In 1646, the Karaites obtained the expulsion of the Rabbinites from Trakai. Despite such tensions, in 1680, Rabbinite community leaders defended the Karaites of Shaty near Trakai against an accusation of blood libel. Representatives of both groups signed an agreement in 1714 to respect the mutual privileges and resolve disputes without involving the Gentile administration.[citation needed]

According to Crimean Karaite tradition, which developed in the 20th century interwar Poland[41] their forefathers were mainly farmers and members of the community who served in the military forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,[42] as well as in the Crimean Khanate. But according to the historical documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the chief occupation of the Crimean Karaites was money lending.[43] They were granted special privileges, including exemption from the military service.[44] In the Crimean Khanate, the Karaites were repressed like other Jews, with prohibitions on behavior extended to riding horses.[45]

Some famous Karaim scholars in Lithuania included Isaac b. Abraham of Troki (1543–1598), Joseph ben Mordecai Malinovski, Zera ben Nathan of Trakai, Salomon ben Aharon of Trakai, Ezra ben Nissan (died in 1666) and Josiah ben Judah (died after 1658). Some of the Karaim became quite wealthy.[citation needed]

During the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Karaim suffered severely during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648 and the wars between Russia and the Commonwealth in the years 1654–1667. The many towns plundered and burnt included Derazhne and Trakai, where only 30 families were left in 1680. The destruction of the Karaite community in Derazhne in 1649 is described in a poem (both in Hebrew and Karaim) by a leader of the congregation, Hazzan Joseph ben Yeshuah HaMashbir.[46] Catholic missionaries worked to convert the local Karaim to Christianity, but were largely unsuccessful.

19th century leaders of the Karaim, such as Sima Babovich and Avraham Firkovich, were driving forces behind a concerted effort to alter the status of the Karaite community in eyes of the Russian legal system. Firkovich in particular was adamant in his attempts to connect the Karaim with the Khazars, and has been accused of forging documents and inscriptions to back up his claims.[47]

Ultimately, the Tsarist government officially recognized the Karaim as being innocent of the death of Jesus. So they were exempt from many of the harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on equal legal footing with Crimean Tatars. The related Krymchak community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.[citation needed]

Solomon Krym (1864–1936), a Crimean Karaite agronomist, was elected in 1906 to the First Duma (1906–1907) as a Kadet (National Democratic Party). On November 16, 1918 he became the Prime Minister of a short-lived Crimean Russian liberal, anti-separatist and anti-Soviet government also supported by the German army.[48]

Since the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Empire the main center of the Qarays is the city of Yevpatoria. Their status under Russian imperial rule bore beneficial fruits for the Karaites decades later.[citation needed]

In 1934, the heads of the Karaite community in Berlin asked the Nazi authorities to exempt Karaites from the anti-Semitic regulations based on their legal status as Russians in Russia. The Reich Agency for the Investigation of Families determined that, from the standpoint of German law, the Karaites were not to be considered Jews. The letter from the Reichsstelle für Sippenforschung (de) officially ruled:

The Karaite sect should not be considered a Jewish religious community within the meaning of paragraph 2, point 2 of the First Regulation to the Reich Citizenship Law. However, it cannot be established that Karaites in their entirety are of blood-related stock, for the racial categorization of an individual cannot be determined without … his personal ancestry and racial biological characteristics

This ruling set the tone for how the Nazis dealt with the Karaite community in Eastern Europe. At the same time, the Nazis had serious reservations about the Karaites. SS Obergruppenfuhrer Gottlob Berger wrote on November 24, 1944:

""Their Mosaic religion is unwelcome. However, on grounds of race, language and religious dogma... Discrimination against the Karaites is unacceptable, in consideration of their racial kinsmen [Berger was here referring to the Crimean Tatars]. However, so as not to infringe the unified anti-Jewish orientation of the nations led by Germany, it is suggested that this small group be given the opportunity of a separate existence (for example, as a closed construction or labor battalion)...""

Despite having exempt status, groups of Karaites were massacred in the early phases of the war. German soldiers who came across Karaites in the Soviet Union during the invasion of Operation Barbarossa, unaware of their legal status under German law, attacked them; 200 were killed at Babi Yar alone. German allies such as Vichy France began to require the Karaites to register as Jews, but eventually granted them non-Jewish status after getting orders by Berlin.[50]

When interrogated, Ashkenazi rabbis in Crimea told the Germans that Karaites were not Jews, in an effort to spare the Karaite community the fate of their Rabbanite neighbors.[51] Many Karaites risked their lives to hide Jews, and in some cases claimed that Jews were members of their community. The Nazis impressed many Karaites into labor battalions.[52]

According to some sources, Nazi racial theory asserted that the Karaites of Crimea were actually Crimean Goths who'd adopted the Crimean Tatar language and their own distinct form of Judaism.[53]

In Vilnius and Trakai, the Nazis forced Karaite Hakham Seraya Shapshal to produce a list of the members of the community. Though he did his best, not every Karaite was saved by Shapshal's list.

After the Soviet recapture of Crimea from Nazi forces in 1944, the Soviet authorities counted 6,357 remaining Karaites. Karaites were not subject to mass deportation, unlike the Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Armenians and others the Soviet authorities alleged had collaborated during the Nazi German occupation. Some individual Karaites were deported.[citation needed]

Assimilation and emigration greatly reduced the ranks of the Karaite community. A few thousand Karaites remain in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland and Russia. Nowadays, the largest communities exist in Israel and the United States; however, these communities are almost entirely Egyptian in origin and ethnically and liturgically distinct from Crimean Karaites. There is also a community of fewer than 100 Karaites in Turkey.[54]

In the 1990s, about 500 Crimean Karaites, mainly from Ukraine, emigrated to Israel under the Law of Return.[55] The Israeli Chief Rabbinate has ruled that Karaites are Jews under Jewish law.[56]

Traditionally, Crimean Karaites had three major subdivisions, each of which maintained their own dialect of the Karaim dialect: the Crimean Karaites, the Galician Karaites, and the Lithuanian Karaites. Today, the distribution is different. The largest number is probably now in Israel; some other Crimean Karaites have left to America or elsewhere. These Karaites are mostly joining non-Crimean-Karaite communities.[57]

According to Karaite tradition, all the Eastern European Karaite communities were derived from those in the Crimea,[58] but some modern historians doubt the Crimean origin of Lithuanian Karaites.[34][59] Nevertheless, this name, ""Crimean Karaites"" is used for the Turkic-speaking Karaites community supposed to have originated in Crimea, distinguishing it from the historically Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic-speaking Karaites of the Middle East.

In 2009, 231 people in Kazakhstan identified as Karaites. This was an unusual jump from the 28 Karaites recorded in 1999.

Karaite communities still exist in Lithuania, but have experienced a steep decline in numbers in recent decades. Historically, they lived mostly in Panevėžys and Trakai, but now most live in Vilnius, where they have a kenesa. There is also a kenesa in Trakai; the Panevėžys community has declined to only a handful of people and does not maintain a house of worship.

Within living memory, the community was many times larger than it is today. The 1979 census in the USSR showed 3,300 Karaim. Lithuanian Karaim Culture Community was founded in 1988. According to the Lithuanian Karaim website the Statistics Department of Lithuania carried out an ethno-statistic research entitled ""Karaim in Lithuania"" in 1997. It was decided to question all adult Karaim and mixed families, where one of the members is a Karaim. During the survey, for the beginning of 1997, there were 257 people of Karaim ethnicity, 32 of whom were children under 16. A similar survey was done in 2021, in honour of the 625th anniversary of Karaite settlement in Lithuania. This coincided with the 2021 national census.

In 2011, 423 individuals identified as Karaims in the Lithuanian census. By 2021, this had dropped to 192, a decline of around 55 percent in a single decade.[7]

In 2011, 346 people in Poland identified as Karaites.

Outside Russian-occupied Crimea (see Ukraine, below), there are 205 self-identifying Karaites as of 2021, nearly all of whom speak Russian as a first language. There are no significant concentrations; the largest community numbers over 60 people in Moscow.

Crimea was traditionally the centre of the Crimean Karaite population. In the Ukrainian census of 2010, just under 60 percent of Ukraine's Karaite population, 715 individuals, lived in Crimea, representing around 30 percent of the global population at the time. However, between the Russian invasion of 2014 and the Russian census of 2021, the population dropped to 295, a fall of almost 60 percent. The war of 2022 may have caused further disruption. This means that the Crimean population is no longer the largest, and is almost certainly smaller than the populations of mainland Ukraine, Poland, and Israel.

Outside Crimea, Karaites historically settled in Galicia, particularly in Halych and Lutsk. However, there is only one Karaite left in Halych today, and the kenesa was shut down in 1959 and eventually demolished. The Galician community had its own dialect of Karaim. The largest contemporary Karaite community is in Kyiv; smaller ones exist in other cities, including Kharkiv, which has a functioning kenesa, although the community numbers only about two dozen.[60] In the 2010 census, 481 Ukrainians identified as Karaites outside of Crimea. In 2021, the Ukrainian government unveiled a bill planned to grant Crimean Karaites and other minority groups official 'Indigenous' status.[61]

Until the 20th century, Karaite Judaism was the only religion of the Karaim,[62] During the Russian Civil War a significant number of Karaim emigrated to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary and then France and Germany.[63][64] Most of them converted to Christianity. The Karaim's modern national movement philanthropist M.S. Sarach was one of them.[65]

The Crimean Karaites' emancipation in the Russian Empire caused cultural assimilation followed by secularization. This process continued in the USSR when most of the kenesas were closed.[54]

In 1928 secular Karaim philologist Seraya Shapshal was elected as Hacham of Polish and Lithuanian Karaim. Being a strong adopter of Russian orientalist V. Grigorjev's theory about the Khazarian origin of the Crimean Karaites, Shapshal developed the Karaim's religion and ""historical dejudaization"" doctrine.[68]

In the mid 1930s, he began to create a theory describing the Altai-Turkic origin of the Karaim and the pagan roots of Karaite religious teaching (worship of sacred oaks, polytheism, led by the god Tengri, the Sacrifice). Shapshal's doctrine is still a topic of critical research and public debate.

He made a number of other changes aimed at the Karaim's Turkification and at erasing the Karaite Jewish elements of their culture and language.[69][70] He issued an order canceling the teaching of Hebrew in Karaite schools and replaced the names of the Jewish holidays and months with Turkic equivalents (see the table below).

According to Shapshal, Crimean Karaites were pagans who adopted the law of Moses, but continued to adhere to their ancient Turkic beliefs. In addition, he claimed that the Karaites had revered Jesus and Mohammed as prophets for centuries. In the Post-Soviet period, Shapshal's theory was further developed in modern Karaylar publications[71] (e.g. ""Crimean Karaite legends"") and was officially adopted by the Crimean Karaim Association ""Krymkaraylar"" (Ассоциация крымских караимов “Крымкарайлар”) as the only correct view of the Karaim's past in 2000.[72]

The ideology of de-Judaization, pan-Turkism and the revival of Tengrism is imbued with the works of the contemporary leaders of the Karaites in Crimea. At the same time, some part of the people retained Jewish customs, several Karaite congregations have registered.[73]

Leon Kull and Kevin Alan Brook led the first scientific study of Crimean Karaites using genetic testing of both Y chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA and their results showed that the Crimean Karaites are indeed partially of Middle Eastern origin and closely related to other Jewish communities (Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews and Egyptian Karaite Jews), while finding that the Crimean Karaites possess a lower affinity to non-Jewish Turkic-speaking peoples of the region.[80][81]

Haplogroups G2a-P15, J1-M267, J2-M172 together make up more than half of the Karaites' gene pool. Next come haplogroups R1a-M198, C3, E1b, T and L.[82]

Karaim belongs to Kypchak sub-branch of the Turkic family and is closely related to Crimean Tatar, Armeno-Kipchak etc. Among the many different influences exerted on Karaim, those of Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian were the first to change the outlook of the Karaim lexicon. Later, due to considerable Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian influence, many Slavic and Baltic words entered the language of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Russian Karaim. Hebrew remained in use for liturgical purposes. Following the Ottoman occupation of Crimea, Turkish was used for business and government purposes among Karaim living on the Crimean peninsula. Three different dialects developed: the Trakai dialect, used in Trakai and Vilnius (Lithuania), the Lutsk or Halych dialect spoken in Lutsk (until World War II), and Halych, and the Crimean dialect. The last forms the Eastern group, while Trakai and Halych Karaim belong to the Western group. Currently only small minority of Karaim can speak the Karaim language (72 Crimean dialect speakers,[2] 118 Trakai dialect speakers, and about 20 Halych dialect speakers).

The most famous Crimean Karaite food is Kybyn (Russian: Кибина pl. Кибины, Karaim: kybyn pl. kybynlar, Lithuanian: Kibinai). Kybynlar are half moon shaped pies of leavened dough with a stuffing of chopped beef or mutton, baked in dutch oven or baking sheet. Other meals common for Crimean Karaites and Tatars are Chiburekki, Pelmeni, Shishlik (These are most often made from mutton).[83]

Union of Horodło,"The Union of Horodło or Pact of Horodło was a set of three acts signed in the town of Horodło on 2 October 1413. The first act was signed by Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland, and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The second and third acts were composed by the Polish nobility (szlachta) and Lithuanian boyars, respectively.[1] The union amended the earlier Polish–Lithuanian unions of Krewo and Vilnius–Radom. Politically, Lithuania received more autonomy as, after the death of Vytautas, the Lithuanian nobles could choose another Grand Duke instead of passing the title to Władysław II Jagiełło or his heir. However, culturally, Lithuania and Poland grew closer. Lithuania adopted Polish institutions of castellans and voivodes. Catholic Lithuanian nobles and church officials were granted equal rights with the Polish nobles and clergy. Forty-seven selected Lithuanian nobles were adopted by Polish families and granted Polish coats of arms. Thus the union signified the beginnings of the Polonization of Lithuanian culture and the rise of the Lithuanian nobility. It was one of the major steps towards the modernization and Europeanization of Lithuania.[2]

Poland and Lithuania had been joined in a personal union since the Union of Krewo of 1385. Both countries were ruled by Władysław II Jagiełło. However, after the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) and the Ostrów Agreement, Vytautas gained the supreme power in Lithuania.[3] The legal basis for Polish–Lithuanian relations was revisited by the Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401, which reiterated de facto Lithuanian independence and de jure Polish supremacy. Vytautas was to be known by the title of Grand Duke (magnus dux) and enjoyed vast power in Lithuania, while technically he was subordinate to Władysław II Jagiełło, 'Supreme Duke' (supremus dux) and King of Poland.[2] The union was signed after Vytautas' army was soundly defeated in the Battle of the Vorskla River and weakened Lithuania was looking for Polish support.[3] Taking advantage of the Lithuanian defeat, the Principality of Smolensk, Veliky Novgorod, and Pskov rebelled against Lithuanian rule, drawing Vytautas into a war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow.[4] However, within a few years peace was re-established in the east.

In 1409, the second Samogitian uprising against the Teutonic Knights escalated into the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. Joint Polish–Lithuanian forces defeated the Knights in the decisive Battle of Grunwald in 1410. However, the war did not resolve all the disputes and by 1413 Poland–Lithuania was preparing for another war with the Knights (see Hunger War).[2][5] These developments encouraged Poland and Lithuania to review their relationship.

The treaty repeated the indissoluble character of the Polish–Lithuanian union while carefully balancing Polish and Lithuanian interests. The Lithuanians gained more autonomy as they received the right to elect a new Grand Duke after the death of Vytautas.[2] The earlier Union of Vilnius and Radom stipulated that Lithuania would pass to Władysław II Jagiełło or his heir. However, the Lithuanian nobles promised to consult the Polish nobles when choosing a successor to Vytautas. The reverse was also true: the Polish nobles promised to consult with the Lithuanians when electing the next Polish King.[1] The pact contained one of the first mentions of the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Polish and Lithuanian nobles agreed to hold a joint general sejm to discuss all major matters, but such a sejm did not take place until 1564.[1] Nevertheless, it was a recognition of the political powers of the Lithuanian nobles.[2]

The Lithuanian nobles and clergy were granted equal rights with the Polish nobility and clergy.[6] However, this extended only to Catholics; many Ruthenian nobles, who were Eastern Orthodox, were excluded,[7] however, in 1434, Grand Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis repealed some of the provisions in the Horodło acts that limited the political rights of Orthodox believers. It would take until 1563 till there was full equality between the two confessions.[8] Selected Lithuanian nobles, 47 in total, were adopted into Polish heraldic families and granted Polish coats of arm. This symbolic gesture signified their desire to adopt Western customs and integrate into Western society.[2] Equal rights encouraged cooperation and kinship between Polish and Lithuanian nobles. The influence of Polish culture continued to increase, culminating in the Union of Lublin of 1569.[1]

Another significant resolution was the adoption of Polish administrative divisions and offices like voivode and castellan by Lithuania. The union created the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius, governed by two Lithuanian nobles.[2] Former Slavic principalities and duchies largely preserved their old political, social, and administrative features for another century. Kiev Voivodeship was established in 1471, and another five voivodeships were established between 1504 and 1514.[9] This administrative change signified the modernization of the Grand Duchy and a decline of traditional dynastic politics. Previously major regions of the Grand Duchy were ruled by members of the ruling dynasty (siblings, children, cousins, etc. of the Grand Duke). Such principalities remained semi-independent and their rulers could become powerful rivals of the Grand Duke with their own claims to the throne.[9] The new voivodeships were governed by trustworthy nobles, unrelated to the royal clan, who could be easily replaced. Soon the nobility replaced members of the ruling dynasty as the driving force behind Lithuanian politics.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Horodło

Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz,"Albert Wijuk Kojałowicz (also Wojciech Wijuk Kojałowicz, Lithuanian: Albertas Kojelavičius-Vijūkas, Vaitiekus Vijūkas-Kojalavičius; Latin: Albertus Koialovicius-Wijuk; 1609–1677) was a Lithuanian historian, theologian and translator. He was a devoted Jesuit and religious polemicist, interested in genealogy and heraldry. He served as a censor, bishops advisor and Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania.[1]

Albert and his brother Casimir (Kazimieras Kojelavičius-Vijūkas [lt]) were born in the House of Perkūnas in Kaunas (or Romainiai according to other sources) to a poor Lithuanian noble family. They bore Kościesza coat of arms, but without a cross-bar.[2] He studied rhetoric, philosophy and theology in which mastered title of doctor in 1645.[3] Later he was appointed as a professor of Alma Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Iesu, teacher of logic, physics, metaphysics and ethic. Together with his brothers he joined Jesuit order and founded its colleges in Kaunas, Vilnius and Polatsk.[2] In 1653 he became rector of Vilnius Academy. He died on 6 October 1677 in Vilnius.

Wijuk Kojałowicz was famous for his rhetoric talent and research in the Lithuanian history. He is considered one of the best and most productive historical writers of the 17th century. Among his forty publications most important is ""Historiae Lituanae"", which was the first full research on the history of Lithuania.

Wijuk Kojałowicz was devoted to the Lithuanian history and his ""Historiae Lituanae"" is considered, next to Maciej Stryjkowski's ""Kronika Polska, Litewska, Żmódzka"" and Alexander Guagnini's ""Sarmatiae Europaeae Descriptio"", as one of the most important studies of history of Lithuania from the mid-seventeenth century. It was used as main source for Lithuanian history until the 19th century.[4]

The study continued the tradition of Lithuanian Chronicles by glorifying the heroic past of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, by voicing the patriotic sentiments and by encouraging Lithuanian nobles to protect the territorial integrity of their fatherland.[5]

Wijuk-Kojałowicz also focused on the imperfection of human memory. Memory is, according to him, a defective instrument, with time it tends to remember incorrectly, incompletely, or not at all. The technology of human memory, in Wijuk-Kojałowicz's view, is always uncertain and doubtful, even the written testimony is bound to mutate and to be distorted.[6] Kojałowicz's implied that the goal of history is nothing else but to preserve memory of all things past. The communal or collective memory is firmest when it is written down:

But all this will be recounted better and more comprehensively for the future generations by the history of the times past, I will only touch upon them in order to show for the future that I was able to publish my history of Lithuania only with the support of Your Grace.[7] There is no doubt that the person who is a celebrated defender of the Lithuanian state must also be a patron of a history of Lithuania...""

In the foreword of the first volume of this work entitled ""An opportunity to write the history of Lithuania"", he admitted that he had not just translated Stryjkowski's history but had revised it ""according to the requirements and laws of a written treatise..."" . According to Wijuk-Kojałowicz, Stryjkowski's history, that was written in Polish was not accessible to foreign readers, and it also broke rhetorics and history principles in many places. Because of his critical stance towards Stryjkowski's ""Kronika..."" Wijuk-Kojałowicz revised it so, that it would teach the young not only the history of their country, but also the Latin language.
His goal, as he admitted himself, was to rewrite Stryjkowski's history in Latin according to the rhetoric principles and historical truth. Kojałowicz's history moved away from metaphorical representation favored by Stryjkowski toward a more balanced description. He replaced Stryjkowski's metaphorical style of historical writing preoccupied with analogy and thereby closer to poetry with a rhetoric focused on the mechanics of telling a linear story.

Despite his critical attitude, Wijuk-Kojałowicz's History of Lithuania reiterated Stryjkowski's chronological and factual errors. As in ""Kronika..."", the death dates of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes Algirdas and Gediminas were incorrect, and the names of Algirdas's sons and uncles were mixed up.[8] The change of places and names, confused in the course of many centuries, sometimes obscured the truth so that it became impossible to distinguish between truth and the fiction for the states were formed during barbarian times when there were no writers.[6] Because of such reasons there remained very few stories about the origins and customs of the Lithuanians, and thus many widespread stories are questionable or false. Kojałowicz was skeptical about the possibility of history written sine ira et studio, without anger and without preconception, without affection and hatred.

Wijuk-Kojałowicz described the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a state consisting of two states, the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and two nations, the Lithuanian and Polish, which were supposed to have equal rights.[6] He extensively described the Union of Lublin which was, in his opinion, a significant event in the history of the Grand Duchy. The Lithuanian nobles were convinced that they needed this union but its conditions had to guarantee and preserve the dignity of the Lithuanian state and Lithuanian nation:

Beyond doubt they wanted the union, but they expected it not to violate the dignity of the state, not to change offices and courts, laws and privileges, customs and finally the borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

In his history, Wijuk-Kojałowicz did not fail to record the continuous rivalry between the Lithuanians and Poles for their rights and privileges and their constant distrust of each other.[6]

Wijuk-Kojałowicz regarded the religion as the most important attribute of national belonging. According to him, neither ethnicity nor language distinguished Lithuanians from Ruthenians but their different creed. Roman Christianity became a definitive composite of a noble's identity.
Wijuk-Kojałowicz wrote that:

A sovereign must appoint to high offices, posts and public duties only a person of the Roman creed, infidels and even some Christians who refuse to be subject to the authority of the Roman Pope must be excluded. Privileges of the whole noble estate must not be applied to those who do not recognize the Catholic religion and do not obey the Pope.

In Kojałowicz's works, the nation was, first of all, imagined as a community with common interests and a shared past. His ideas about the historical nation were not only a reflection of cultural forces in the state, they were instrumental in forging popular imagination of the historical community of the Grand Duchy. The word ""nation"" (natio), which he often used, was expressed as a problematic ambivalence in imagining and fictionalizing the community of Lithuania.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Wijuk_Kojałowicz
Kibinai,"Kibinai, kybyn, or kibin (plural in Karaim language: kybynlar / Qıbınlar (Common Turkic Latin); singular in Lithuanian: kibinas) are traditional pastries filled with mutton and onion, popular with the Karaite ethnic minority in Lithuania.[1] As everything Karaite in Lithuania, they are mostly associated with the city of Trakai.[2] English-language travel guides compare them to Cornish pasties.[3]

President of Lithuania,"The president of the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos Prezidentas) is the head of state of the Republic of Lithuania. The president directs and appoints the executive branch of the Government of Lithuania, represents the nation internationally and is the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The president is directly elected by the citizens of Lithuania for a five-year term, with the office holder limited to serving two terms consecutively. The current president is Gitanas Nausėda who assumed office on July 12, 2019.

To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 40 years old on the election day and reside in Lithuania for at least three years, in addition to satisfying the eligibility criteria for a member of the parliament. A person who has been removed from office through impeachment for breach of constitution or an oath of office may not be elected as a president.[2]

The Lithuanian president has somewhat more executive authority than their counterparts in neighboring Estonia and Latvia; the Lithuanian president's function is very similar to that of the presidents of France and Romania. Similarly to them, but unlike presidents in a fully presidential system such as the United States, the Lithuanian president generally has the most authority in foreign affairs. In addition to the customary diplomatic powers of Heads of State, namely receiving the letters of credence of foreign ambassadors and signing treaties, the president determines Lithuania's basic foreign policy guidelines. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, and accordingly heads the State Defense Council and has the right to appoint the Chief of Defence (subject to Seimas consent).[3]

The president also has a significant role in domestic policy, possessing the right to submit bills to the Seimas and to veto laws passed by it, appointing the prime minister and approving the government formed by them, and also having the right to dissolve the Seimas and call snap elections following a successful motion of no confidence or if the Seimas refuses to approve the government's budget within sixty days. However, the next elected Seimas may retaliate by calling for an earlier presidential election.[4]

Finally, the president ensures an effective judiciary, being responsible for nominating one third of the judges of the Constitutional Court, and the entirety of the Supreme Court, for appointment by the Seimas; the president also has the right to directly appoint all other judges.

Under the Constitution of Lithuania adopted in 1992, the president is elected to a five-year term under a modified two-round system: a candidate requires an absolute majority of the vote and either voter turnout to be above 50% or for their vote share to be equivalent to at least one-third of the number of registered voters to win the election in the first round.[5] If no candidate does so, the two candidates with the most votes face each other in a second round held two weeks later. Upon taking office, the president must suspend any formal membership in a political party.[4]

If the president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, the Speaker of the Seimas assumes the office until a new president can be inaugurated following fresh elections.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Lithuania

4th Infantry Regiment (Lithuania),"4th Infantry Regiment, later the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Lithuanian King Mindaugas (Lithuanian: Ketvirtasis pėstininkų Lietuvos Karaliaus Mindaugo pulkas) was a Lithuanian Army infantry regiment that existed from 1918 to 1940 and was located in Panevėžys.

The regiment was founded on 29 December 1918,[1][2] when the Defence Ministry of the Lithuanian Republic allowed the officer Jonas Variakojis to assemble and command the Panevėžys Region Defence Unit (Lithuanian: Panevėžio srities apsaugos būrys).[3] On 5 January 1919, Variakojis managed to salvage 70 rifles out of the retreating German Army and by 7 January, his unit received its first order.[3] From 22 March, the unit is known as the Separate Panevėžys Battalion (Lithuanian: Panevėžio atskirasis batalionas) and from 20 June 1919 as the Panevėžys Battalion (Lithuanian: Panevėžio batalionas).[2][3]

The military formation was fighting the invading Bolsheviks from its foundation, specifically near Panevėžys, Kėdainiai and Ukmergė. On 18-23 May 1919, the regiment took part in the Kurkliai-Panevėžys operation, although it did not succeed in defending Panevėžys. Much more successful was the soon after Kupiškis-Utena operation from 26 May to 3 June, during which Kupiškis, Rokiškis and Alūkšta were liberated. The regiment pushed the Bolsheviks beyond the Daugava river.[4]

From 15 October 1919, the regiment fought the Bermontians.

For its victorious battles, the Šiauliai town gave the unit a flag on 1 November 1919, the same day the unit was called the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Lithuanian King Mindaugas.[3]

On 26 July 1920, the regiment entered Vilnius and defended it against Polish attacks in the start of October, later engaging them in the Musninkai-Širvintos sector, later partaking in the Battle of Giedraičiai. During the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, 3 officers and 72 soldiers of the regiment were killed in action, while 121 soldiers were wounded in combat.[3] Order of the Cross of Vytis was accorded to 33 officers and 198 soldiers of the regiment.[5][3]

In 1922, the regiment was moved to Panevėžys. In 1926, it was given the flag of the 3rd Class Order of the Cross of Vytis with the inscription: ""God, help us defend the Fatherland's liberty and honour"".[6] The regiment was part of the 1st Lithuanian Infantry Division, whose subunits were sometimes located in Kupiškis ir Ukmergė.

With the Soviet Occupation of Lithuania, the regiment was renamed as the ""4th Infantry Regiment"" on 25 July 1940 and disbanded on 30 August 1940.[3] On the disbanded regiment's basis, the Red Army's 215th Rifle Regiment was formed on 9 September 1940.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Infantry_Regiment_(Lithuania)

Crimean Karaites,"Crimean Karaites or simply Karaites (Crimean Karaim: Кърымкъарайлар, Qrımqaraylar, singular къарай, qaray; Trakai dialect: karajlar, singular karaj; Hebrew: קראי מזרח אירופה; Crimean Tatar: Qaraylar; Yiddish: קרימישע קאַראַיִמער, romanized: krimishe karaimer), also known more broadly as Eastern European Karaites, are a traditionally Turkic-speaking Judaic ethnoreligious group[8][9] native to Crimea.[10][11][12] Nowadays, most Karaim in Eastern Europe speak the dominant local language of their respective regions.[13]

The Karaite religion, known in Eastern Europe as Karaism, split from mainstream Rabbinical Judaism in the 19th and 20th centuries, though differences date back to the 12th century. They have lived alongside Krymchaks.[14] Most Karaites in the region do not consider themselves to be Jews, associating the ethnonym with Rabbinical Jews alone, but rather consider themselves to be descendants of the Khazars, non-Rabbinical Judeans, or other Turkic peoples.[15]

Research into the origins of the Karaites indicates they are of ethnic Jewish origin and are genetically closely related to other Jewish diaspora groups.[16][17] Some researchers believe they originated in Constantinople and later settled in the Byzantine Principality of Theodoro.[18]

A closely related group, the Slavic Karaites, were formally accepted into the Karaite ethnoreligious community of Crimea after the deposition of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917. They are descendants of ethnic Russian Subbotniks.[19][20] However, most Slavs claiming to be Karaites in Eastern Europe are not members of the Karaite ethnoreligious community, and are not accepted as legitimate Karaites.

Turkic-speaking Karaite Jews (in the Crimean Tatar language, Qaraylar) have lived in Crimea for centuries. Most[21][22] modern scientists regard them as descendants of Karaite Jews who settled in Crimea and adopted a Kypchak language. Others[23][vague] view them as descendants of Khazar or Cuman, Kipchak converts to Karaite Judaism. Today, many Crimean Karaites reject ethnic Semitic origins theories and identify as descendants of the Khazars.[24] Some specialists in Khazar history question the Khazar theory of Karaim origins,[25][26] noting the following:

In 19th century Crimea, Karaites began to distinguish themselves from other Jewish groups, sending envoys to the czars to plead for exemptions from harsh anti-Jewish legislation. These entreaties were successful, in large part due to the tsars' wariness of the Talmud, and in 1863 Karaites were granted the same rights as their Christian and Tatar neighbors. Exempted from the Pale of Settlement, later they were considered non-Jews by Nazis. This left the community untouched by the Holocaust, unlike other Turkic-speaking Jews, like the Krymchak Jews that were almost wiped out.[31]

Miller says that Crimean Karaites did not start claiming a distinct identity apart from the Jewish people before the 19th century, and that such leaders as Avraham Firkovich and Sima Babovich encouraged this position to avoid the strong antisemitism of the period.[32]

From the time of the Golden Horde onward, Karaites were present in many towns and villages throughout Crimea and around the Black Sea. During the period of the Crimean Khanate, they had major communities in the towns of Çufut Qale, Sudak, Kefe, and Bakhchysarai.[citation needed]

According to Karaite tradition,[33] Grand Duke Vytautas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania relocated one branch of the Crimean Karaites to Lithuania ordering to build them a town, called today Trakai. There they continued to speak their own language. This legend originally referring to 1218 as the date of relocation contradicts the fact that the Lithuanian dialect of the Karaim language differs significantly from the Crimean one.[34] The Lithuanian Karaites settled primarily in Vilnius and Trakai, as well as in Biržai, Pasvalys, Naujamiestis and Upytė – smaller settlements throughout Lithuania proper.[citation needed]

The Lithuanian Karaites also settled in lands of modern Belarus and Ukraine, which were part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Karaite communities emerged in Halych and Kukeziv (near Lviv) in Galicia, as well as in Lutsk and Derazhne in Volhynia.[35][36][37] Jews (Rabbinites and Karaites) in Lithuanian territory were granted a measure of autonomy under Michel Ezofovich Senior's[38] management. The Trakai Karaim refused to comply, citing differences in faith. Later all Jews, including Karaites,[39] were placed under the authority of the Rabbinite ""Council of Four Lands"" (Vaad)[40] and ""Council of the Land of Lithuania"" taxation (1580–1646). The Yiddish-speaking Rabbinites considered the Turkic-speaking Karaites to be apostates, and kept them in a subordinate and depressed position. The Karaites resented this treatment. In 1646, the Karaites obtained the expulsion of the Rabbinites from Trakai. Despite such tensions, in 1680, Rabbinite community leaders defended the Karaites of Shaty near Trakai against an accusation of blood libel. Representatives of both groups signed an agreement in 1714 to respect the mutual privileges and resolve disputes without involving the Gentile administration.[citation needed]

According to Crimean Karaite tradition, which developed in the 20th century interwar Poland[41] their forefathers were mainly farmers and members of the community who served in the military forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth,[42] as well as in the Crimean Khanate. But according to the historical documents of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the chief occupation of the Crimean Karaites was money lending.[43] They were granted special privileges, including exemption from the military service.[44] In the Crimean Khanate, the Karaites were repressed like other Jews, with prohibitions on behavior extended to riding horses.[45]

Some famous Karaim scholars in Lithuania included Isaac b. Abraham of Troki (1543–1598), Joseph ben Mordecai Malinovski, Zera ben Nathan of Trakai, Salomon ben Aharon of Trakai, Ezra ben Nissan (died in 1666) and Josiah ben Judah (died after 1658). Some of the Karaim became quite wealthy.[citation needed]

During the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Karaim suffered severely during the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648 and the wars between Russia and the Commonwealth in the years 1654–1667. The many towns plundered and burnt included Derazhne and Trakai, where only 30 families were left in 1680. The destruction of the Karaite community in Derazhne in 1649 is described in a poem (both in Hebrew and Karaim) by a leader of the congregation, Hazzan Joseph ben Yeshuah HaMashbir.[46] Catholic missionaries worked to convert the local Karaim to Christianity, but were largely unsuccessful.

19th century leaders of the Karaim, such as Sima Babovich and Avraham Firkovich, were driving forces behind a concerted effort to alter the status of the Karaite community in eyes of the Russian legal system. Firkovich in particular was adamant in his attempts to connect the Karaim with the Khazars, and has been accused of forging documents and inscriptions to back up his claims.[47]

Ultimately, the Tsarist government officially recognized the Karaim as being innocent of the death of Jesus. So they were exempt from many of the harsh restrictions placed on other Jews. They were, in essence, placed on equal legal footing with Crimean Tatars. The related Krymchak community, which was of similar ethnolinguistic background but which practiced rabbinical Judaism, continued to suffer under Tsarist anti-Jewish laws.[citation needed]

Solomon Krym (1864–1936), a Crimean Karaite agronomist, was elected in 1906 to the First Duma (1906–1907) as a Kadet (National Democratic Party). On November 16, 1918 he became the Prime Minister of a short-lived Crimean Russian liberal, anti-separatist and anti-Soviet government also supported by the German army.[48]

Since the incorporation of Crimea into the Russian Empire the main center of the Qarays is the city of Yevpatoria. Their status under Russian imperial rule bore beneficial fruits for the Karaites decades later.[citation needed]

In 1934, the heads of the Karaite community in Berlin asked the Nazi authorities to exempt Karaites from the anti-Semitic regulations based on their legal status as Russians in Russia. The Reich Agency for the Investigation of Families determined that, from the standpoint of German law, the Karaites were not to be considered Jews. The letter from the Reichsstelle für Sippenforschung (de) officially ruled:

The Karaite sect should not be considered a Jewish religious community within the meaning of paragraph 2, point 2 of the First Regulation to the Reich Citizenship Law. However, it cannot be established that Karaites in their entirety are of blood-related stock, for the racial categorization of an individual cannot be determined without … his personal ancestry and racial biological characteristics

This ruling set the tone for how the Nazis dealt with the Karaite community in Eastern Europe. At the same time, the Nazis had serious reservations about the Karaites. SS Obergruppenfuhrer Gottlob Berger wrote on November 24, 1944:

""Their Mosaic religion is unwelcome. However, on grounds of race, language and religious dogma... Discrimination against the Karaites is unacceptable, in consideration of their racial kinsmen [Berger was here referring to the Crimean Tatars]. However, so as not to infringe the unified anti-Jewish orientation of the nations led by Germany, it is suggested that this small group be given the opportunity of a separate existence (for example, as a closed construction or labor battalion)...""

Despite having exempt status, groups of Karaites were massacred in the early phases of the war. German soldiers who came across Karaites in the Soviet Union during the invasion of Operation Barbarossa, unaware of their legal status under German law, attacked them; 200 were killed at Babi Yar alone. German allies such as Vichy France began to require the Karaites to register as Jews, but eventually granted them non-Jewish status after getting orders by Berlin.[50]

When interrogated, Ashkenazi rabbis in Crimea told the Germans that Karaites were not Jews, in an effort to spare the Karaite community the fate of their Rabbanite neighbors.[51] Many Karaites risked their lives to hide Jews, and in some cases claimed that Jews were members of their community. The Nazis impressed many Karaites into labor battalions.[52]

According to some sources, Nazi racial theory asserted that the Karaites of Crimea were actually Crimean Goths who'd adopted the Crimean Tatar language and their own distinct form of Judaism.[53]

In Vilnius and Trakai, the Nazis forced Karaite Hakham Seraya Shapshal to produce a list of the members of the community. Though he did his best, not every Karaite was saved by Shapshal's list.

After the Soviet recapture of Crimea from Nazi forces in 1944, the Soviet authorities counted 6,357 remaining Karaites. Karaites were not subject to mass deportation, unlike the Crimean Tatars, Greeks, Armenians and others the Soviet authorities alleged had collaborated during the Nazi German occupation. Some individual Karaites were deported.[citation needed]

Assimilation and emigration greatly reduced the ranks of the Karaite community. A few thousand Karaites remain in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland and Russia. Nowadays, the largest communities exist in Israel and the United States; however, these communities are almost entirely Egyptian in origin and ethnically and liturgically distinct from Crimean Karaites. There is also a community of fewer than 100 Karaites in Turkey.[54]

In the 1990s, about 500 Crimean Karaites, mainly from Ukraine, emigrated to Israel under the Law of Return.[55] The Israeli Chief Rabbinate has ruled that Karaites are Jews under Jewish law.[56]

Traditionally, Crimean Karaites had three major subdivisions, each of which maintained their own dialect of the Karaim dialect: the Crimean Karaites, the Galician Karaites, and the Lithuanian Karaites. Today, the distribution is different. The largest number is probably now in Israel; some other Crimean Karaites have left to America or elsewhere. These Karaites are mostly joining non-Crimean-Karaite communities.[57]

According to Karaite tradition, all the Eastern European Karaite communities were derived from those in the Crimea,[58] but some modern historians doubt the Crimean origin of Lithuanian Karaites.[34][59] Nevertheless, this name, ""Crimean Karaites"" is used for the Turkic-speaking Karaites community supposed to have originated in Crimea, distinguishing it from the historically Aramaic, Hebrew, and Arabic-speaking Karaites of the Middle East.

In 2009, 231 people in Kazakhstan identified as Karaites. This was an unusual jump from the 28 Karaites recorded in 1999.

Karaite communities still exist in Lithuania, but have experienced a steep decline in numbers in recent decades. Historically, they lived mostly in Panevėžys and Trakai, but now most live in Vilnius, where they have a kenesa. There is also a kenesa in Trakai; the Panevėžys community has declined to only a handful of people and does not maintain a house of worship.

Within living memory, the community was many times larger than it is today. The 1979 census in the USSR showed 3,300 Karaim. Lithuanian Karaim Culture Community was founded in 1988. According to the Lithuanian Karaim website the Statistics Department of Lithuania carried out an ethno-statistic research entitled ""Karaim in Lithuania"" in 1997. It was decided to question all adult Karaim and mixed families, where one of the members is a Karaim. During the survey, for the beginning of 1997, there were 257 people of Karaim ethnicity, 32 of whom were children under 16. A similar survey was done in 2021, in honour of the 625th anniversary of Karaite settlement in Lithuania. This coincided with the 2021 national census.

In 2011, 423 individuals identified as Karaims in the Lithuanian census. By 2021, this had dropped to 192, a decline of around 55 percent in a single decade.[7]

In 2011, 346 people in Poland identified as Karaites.

Outside Russian-occupied Crimea (see Ukraine, below), there are 205 self-identifying Karaites as of 2021, nearly all of whom speak Russian as a first language. There are no significant concentrations; the largest community numbers over 60 people in Moscow.

Crimea was traditionally the centre of the Crimean Karaite population. In the Ukrainian census of 2010, just under 60 percent of Ukraine's Karaite population, 715 individuals, lived in Crimea, representing around 30 percent of the global population at the time. However, between the Russian invasion of 2014 and the Russian census of 2021, the population dropped to 295, a fall of almost 60 percent. The war of 2022 may have caused further disruption. This means that the Crimean population is no longer the largest, and is almost certainly smaller than the populations of mainland Ukraine, Poland, and Israel.

Outside Crimea, Karaites historically settled in Galicia, particularly in Halych and Lutsk. However, there is only one Karaite left in Halych today, and the kenesa was shut down in 1959 and eventually demolished. The Galician community had its own dialect of Karaim. The largest contemporary Karaite community is in Kyiv; smaller ones exist in other cities, including Kharkiv, which has a functioning kenesa, although the community numbers only about two dozen.[60] In the 2010 census, 481 Ukrainians identified as Karaites outside of Crimea. In 2021, the Ukrainian government unveiled a bill planned to grant Crimean Karaites and other minority groups official 'Indigenous' status.[61]

Until the 20th century, Karaite Judaism was the only religion of the Karaim,[62] During the Russian Civil War a significant number of Karaim emigrated to Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary and then France and Germany.[63][64] Most of them converted to Christianity. The Karaim's modern national movement philanthropist M.S. Sarach was one of them.[65]

The Crimean Karaites' emancipation in the Russian Empire caused cultural assimilation followed by secularization. This process continued in the USSR when most of the kenesas were closed.[54]

In 1928 secular Karaim philologist Seraya Shapshal was elected as Hacham of Polish and Lithuanian Karaim. Being a strong adopter of Russian orientalist V. Grigorjev's theory about the Khazarian origin of the Crimean Karaites, Shapshal developed the Karaim's religion and ""historical dejudaization"" doctrine.[68]

In the mid 1930s, he began to create a theory describing the Altai-Turkic origin of the Karaim and the pagan roots of Karaite religious teaching (worship of sacred oaks, polytheism, led by the god Tengri, the Sacrifice). Shapshal's doctrine is still a topic of critical research and public debate.

He made a number of other changes aimed at the Karaim's Turkification and at erasing the Karaite Jewish elements of their culture and language.[69][70] He issued an order canceling the teaching of Hebrew in Karaite schools and replaced the names of the Jewish holidays and months with Turkic equivalents (see the table below).

According to Shapshal, Crimean Karaites were pagans who adopted the law of Moses, but continued to adhere to their ancient Turkic beliefs. In addition, he claimed that the Karaites had revered Jesus and Mohammed as prophets for centuries. In the Post-Soviet period, Shapshal's theory was further developed in modern Karaylar publications[71] (e.g. ""Crimean Karaite legends"") and was officially adopted by the Crimean Karaim Association ""Krymkaraylar"" (Ассоциация крымских караимов “Крымкарайлар”) as the only correct view of the Karaim's past in 2000.[72]

The ideology of de-Judaization, pan-Turkism and the revival of Tengrism is imbued with the works of the contemporary leaders of the Karaites in Crimea. At the same time, some part of the people retained Jewish customs, several Karaite congregations have registered.[73]

Leon Kull and Kevin Alan Brook led the first scientific study of Crimean Karaites using genetic testing of both Y chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA and their results showed that the Crimean Karaites are indeed partially of Middle Eastern origin and closely related to other Jewish communities (Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews and Egyptian Karaite Jews), while finding that the Crimean Karaites possess a lower affinity to non-Jewish Turkic-speaking peoples of the region.[80][81]

Haplogroups G2a-P15, J1-M267, J2-M172 together make up more than half of the Karaites' gene pool. Next come haplogroups R1a-M198, C3, E1b, T and L.[82]

Karaim belongs to Kypchak sub-branch of the Turkic family and is closely related to Crimean Tatar, Armeno-Kipchak etc. Among the many different influences exerted on Karaim, those of Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian were the first to change the outlook of the Karaim lexicon. Later, due to considerable Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian influence, many Slavic and Baltic words entered the language of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukrainian, and Russian Karaim. Hebrew remained in use for liturgical purposes. Following the Ottoman occupation of Crimea, Turkish was used for business and government purposes among Karaim living on the Crimean peninsula. Three different dialects developed: the Trakai dialect, used in Trakai and Vilnius (Lithuania), the Lutsk or Halych dialect spoken in Lutsk (until World War II), and Halych, and the Crimean dialect. The last forms the Eastern group, while Trakai and Halych Karaim belong to the Western group. Currently only small minority of Karaim can speak the Karaim language (72 Crimean dialect speakers,[2] 118 Trakai dialect speakers, and about 20 Halych dialect speakers).

The most famous Crimean Karaite food is Kybyn (Russian: Кибина pl. Кибины, Karaim: kybyn pl. kybynlar, Lithuanian: Kibinai). Kybynlar are half moon shaped pies of leavened dough with a stuffing of chopped beef or mutton, baked in dutch oven or baking sheet. Other meals common for Crimean Karaites and Tatars are Chiburekki, Pelmeni, Shishlik (These are most often made from mutton).[83]

Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces,"The National Defence Volunteer Forces or NDVF (Lithuanian: Krašto apsaugos savanorių pajėgos [KASP], previously Savanoriškoji krašto apsaugos tarnyba [SKAT]) is a branch of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. Volunteer forces were officially established on 17 January 1991 by the law of the Supreme Council of Lithuania on the National Defence Volunteer Service providing basis for establishing Voluntary National Defence Service. This decision made legal already existing volunteer formations that began appearing as early as 1990. Voluntary National Defence Service was reorganised into the National Defence Volunteer Force.  In 2003 Volunteer Force was integrated into the Lithuanian Land Force. Tasks of volunteer soldiers were inevitably altered when Lithuania became a full-fledged member of NATO: approach of territorial defence was changed into territorial defence and training of modern active reserve. There are around 5000 volunteers and around 800 professional soldiers in the force.

The NDVF's history is somewhat linked to the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, which was the largest self-defence forces organization with official status in Lithuania before the Soviet occupation in 1940. Also Territorial dragoon service can be considered an indirect predecessor of today's NDVF (according to the way military service is performed).

During 1991 all units of the National Defence System were formed on a voluntary basis.

On 11 January 1991 several hundred of the Parliament defenders took an oath of allegiance to the Republic of Lithuania and with support from the public began preparing for a possible attack against the Lithuanian Supreme Council building (presently the Parliament of Lithuania). Other volunteers joined units to protect facilities of the Press Palace, Vilnius Television Tower, and other strategic assets when the Soviet Union was attempting to overthrow the legal government of Lithuania and reintroduce an occupational regime in January 1991.

On 17 January 1991 the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania passed the law on the National Defence Volunteer Service, which became the basis for the establishment of the then Voluntary National Defence Service (VNDS).

In March 1991 the VNDS staff, an operational platoon, the VNDS Training Centre were formed as well as 200 company-size units were organized into eight territorial defence regions. In accordance with an order issued by Director General of Department of National Defence, Colonel Jonas Gečas was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Voluntary National Defence Service.

During the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, volunteer serviceman Artūras Sakalauskas lost his life in the line of duty when defending the Lithuanian Supreme Council on 21 August.

Once the coup d'état was defeated, NDVS units received an order to block the Soviet forces in order to prevent them from bringing replacement troops from Russia into Lithuania. At that time forty-four guard posts were installed where 201 NDVS members would simultaneously stand on duty. At the end of 1991, the Volunteer Forces embarked upon the protection of national strategic assets.

Volunteer units provided support to civilian authorities in the event of natural or industrial disasters. In the summer of 1992, thousands of volunteers assisted in fighting fires in wooded areas and peat lands; they participated in cleaning hazardous spill on the Nemunas River subsequent to an ecological disaster in Belarus. They also took part in relief activities during the flood of the Nemunas Delta in the Western part of Lithuania. In 1993, during a visit of Pope John Paul II to Lithuania, thousands of volunteers helped the police maintain public order.

The Volunteer units took part in the first military exercises organised by the Lithuanian Armed Forces including the first joint military exercises Safeguard '93, Wind of Spring (1997–1998), Baltic Challenge (1998), Amber Hope series.

Starting in 1994 members of the Volunteer Forces began participating international peacekeeping missions.

In 1998 the Voluntary National Defence Service (SKAT in Lithuanian) was reorganised as the National Defence Volunteer Forces, KASP – in Lithuanian) and became an integral part of the Lithuanian Armed Forces.

As of May 2023 the organization of the National Defence Volunteer Forces is as follows:[1]

Official date of establishment of the (SKAT) Vilnius territorial unit (now - the 8th Territorial Unit of NDVF National Defense Volunteer Forces (KASP) Great Battle District is 1991. on March 1, when the first staff list of the territorial defense unit was approved.

In 1992 On November 23, commemorating the Day of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, a battle flag was presented to the unit at the Cathedral Square in Vilnius.

In 1999 On January 15, in order to perpetuate the names of the military districts of the partisans of the Lithuanian freedom movement, the Unit was given a name and it is called the 8th Territorial defense unit of the Great Battle District.

It has over 1,000 volunteer soldiers and ~80 professional military servicemen serve together with Staff Headquarters & Supply Company, in Vilnius

Tasks of the NDVF are training volunteers and other members of active reserve, units of NDVF for conducting territorial and collective defence tasks, preparing and participating in international operations, guarding important objects of defence infrastructure, state and municipal administration, and render assistance in case of natural disasters and catastrophes.

Lithuanian collaboration with Nazi Germany,"Lithuanian collaboration with Nazi Germany took place during World War II, primarily on the territory of Lithuania during its occupation by German forces from 1941 to 1944.

Collaboration and cooperation with Nazi Germany among Lithuanians had various causes. The main reason was the experience of the brutal Soviet occupation, which automatically directed the hopes and aspirations of Lithuanians toward Nazi Germany. In general, Lithuanians saw in cooperation with the Germans an opportunity to realize their own national goals; although few deluded themselves that the Germans would restore full independence to the Lithuanians, the hope of receiving some form of autonomy was widespread, as well as support in conflicts with other ethnic groups under German occupation, such as Poles and Belarusians. Lithuanian collaboration covered a wide spectrum of postures from the politically motivated conditional cooperation to complete identification with the goals of the occupier, genuine collaboration.[1]

The German army was welcomed by the Lithuanian population in June 1941 with joy and as liberators. At that time, the level of collaboration and cooperation with the Germans was at its highest and usually undertaken completely voluntarily. Enthusiasm subsided, however, as early as the fall of 1941 when hopes for the creation of any Lithuanian autonomy proved illusory. The next turning point was the defeat at Stalingrad suffered by Germany in early 1943, from which point Germany's defeat in the war seemed inevitable.[2] From then on, the resentment of the Lithuanian population against the increasingly oppressive occupiers grew. Attempts to draw new groups into collaboration generally failed, emblematic of which was the failed attempt to form a Lithuanian Waffen-SS legion. Only the looming Soviet threat, which for many Lithuanians still seemed more lethal than the German occupation, became a field for new collaboration. The recruitment success of the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force was precisely the fruit of cooperation on this front. It ended, however, with the brutal disbanding of the unit after it refused to defend Germany itself.[3]

Despite the changing sentiment, Lithuanian police formations and Lithuanian administrative personnel continued to collaborate throughout the entire war. Among the former, the Lithuanian Auxiliary Police and special units such as the Lithuanian TDA Battalion, which took an active part in Holocaust crimes and mass murder of civilians, were particularly notorious.

At the beginning of World War II, which began with the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, Lithuania remained a neutral country. However, after Poland's defeat, pressure intensified on Lithuania, which was forced to sign he mutual assistance pact of October 10, 1939, with the Soviet Union, making it a de facto Soviet protectorate.[4] Under this agreement, however, Lithuania received part of the Vilnius region, which had previously been part of Poland. On June 15, 1940, all of Lithuania was occupied and absorbed into the Soviet Union.[4]

The period of Soviet occupation led to a strengthening of negative feelings toward national minorities in Lithuania, especially Jews. During the Soviet occupation, tensions between Lithuanian Jews and ethnic Lithuanians increased significantly, as the former often welcomed the incoming Soviet power, and their situation improved under it.[5] Ethnic Lithuanians, on the other hand, were proportionately more often victims of Soviet repression, as a result of which many of them began to see Germany as an ally and liberator.[6] This led to a significant increase in anti-Semitic sentiment. This was reinforced by the belief, not based on facts, that there was significant Jewish involvement in the Soviet administration and terror apparatus.[7] There was a widespread view that the collapse of independent Lithuania was caused by ""Jewish treason,"" while the deportations were organized by the ""Jewish-Soviet NKVD"".[8] Also strained relations prevailed between Lithuanians and Poles, who often viewed the Lithuanians as third occupiers of their country.[9]

The Soviet occupation triggered a strong anti-Soviet resistance movement that resulted in an armed uprising in June 1941, at the time of the German invasion of the USSR. Most of the later pro-Nazi collaborators had previously been members of the anti-Soviet resistance movement.[9] However, anti-Sovietism was not the only factor that attracted people to the Nazis; fascination with corporatism, social discipline, economic and racial anti-Semitism, and the vision of building a Axis Europe were also important.[9]

On November 17, 1940, a group of émigrés formed the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF) in Berlin, headed by former Lithuanian envoy in Berlin Colonel Kazys Škirpa.[10] Formally founded as an alliance of all anti-communist parties, it quickly assumed militant nationalist positions.[10] In opposition to it remained exiled in USA former president Antanas Smetona and many Lithuanian diplomats of the older generation, associated with the Smetona regime and generally opposed to Nazi ideology.[10]

The LAF drew its ideological roots in the pre-war Lithuanian Activist Movement (LAS), whose leader philosopher Antanas Maceina was the LAF's ideological guide.[10] LAS advocated cooperation with the axis and preached fascist-like and anti-Semitic views.[11] Another more radical LAF ideologue was intellectual Bronys Raila, an activist in the nationalist movement before the war, wrote a draft program for the LAF in which he advocated the overthrow of ""democratism,"" the unification of Lithuanians and Latvians to create a ""united Aestian ideal"" and an alliance with Germany. He also demanded that Lithuania be cleansed of ""Jews, parasites and traitors,"" that Jews be deprived of their property and expelled.[12] In their resolutions LAF denied the Lithuanian Jews a place in the future Lithuanian state, and also annulled medieval settlement privileges, thus excluding the Jews from Lithuanian statehood.[13]

Although the LAF was headquartered in Berlin it also tried to operate in the occupied country, but contacts with LAF activists in Lithuania were limited, maintained through a handful of couriers. It is difficult to assess how much the center in Berlin influenced the sentiment in the country and vice versa. It is possible that the LAF's growing anti-Semitic attitude was an effect of the mood in the Soviet-occupied country.[14]

The LAF organized an underground network in Soviet-controlled Lithuania. The intelligence and sabotage operations they provided were helpful to the Germans once the invasion of the Soviet Union began.[15] However, the LAF also had its own goals; the uprising they organized, aimed primarily at capturing Kaunas and Vilnius before the Germans, was designed to present them with a fait accompli and force them to recognize at least Lithuanian autonomy.[15] The uprising proved successful. The Lithuanian population, driven to despair by the last wave of deportations of some 20,000 people on June 14-17, 1941, just a week before the German invasion of the USSR, rose enthusiastically against the Soviets and their supporters.[16]

The LAF formed uniformed paramilitary units in Kaunas and Vilnius. They were to support the formed provisional government headed by Juozas Ambrazevičius and became the basis of the future Lithuanian army.[17] These units were transformed by the Germans into the Aufbaudienst and were subordinated to the German Ordnungspolizei.[18] In addition to these units, there were many less regular partisan forces, operating independently. From the very beginning, they organized or participated in pogroms against the Jewish population and in the plundering of their property.[13] The insurgents also clashed with Red Army units and Communist militias, and nearly a thousand insurgents were killed in such battles.[19]

German forces, primarily Einsatzgruppe A, began the process of exterminating the Jewish population in the first hours of the invasion.[20] They found many auxiliaries among the Lithuanian formations. Among them were partisan divisions, as well as units of the reconstituted Lithuanian police, and elements of the civilian local administration.[21] The Provisional Government or LAF although they claimed sovereignty, their real power was severely limited. They contributed to the spread of anti-Jewish violence with their anti-Semitic rhetoric, although not directly calling for slaughter.[22] The provisional government issued the Statutes on the Situation of the Jews [lt] on August 1, 1941, in which they restricted the civil rights of Jews and forced them to wear distinctive badges.[23]

The provisional government was dissolved on 5 August 1941 and LAF was banned by Germans on 26 September 1941.[17]

After the first wave of spontaneous anti-Jewish violence of the early summer of 1941, came a phase of planned extermination of the Jewish population, which happened between August and October 1941. In this German-managed process, most of the personnel were locals, primarily former partisans and police officers.[24] In August 1941, the Lithuanian police, led by Col. Vytautas Reivytis [lt], began collecting data on Jewish communities, and then, on the basis of Secret Circular No. 3, began the process of gathering Jews for ""transportation to camps.""[24]

The National Labor Service (TDA) battalion, recruited mainly from Lithuanian Red Army deserters, played a crucial role in the process of extermination. Officers were mainly Voldemarists, Nazi-like extreme nationalists, grouped in the Lithuanian Nationalist Party [lt].[24]

Detached from TDA contingent, commanded by Bronius Norkus, as a part of Rollkommando Hamann, was responsible for the deaths of at least half of the 125,000 Jews killed in Lithuania between August 1 and December 1, 1941.[25] Most of them in the countryside.[25] In Ponary, near Vilnius, the killings were carried out by the Special Squad of the German Security Police and SD, known as Ypatingasis būrys.[25] TDA units were active in Kaunas, including the October 28, 1941 massacre of 10,000 Jews at the Ninth Fort in Kaunas. This was the largest single massacre of Jews in Lithuania.[25] In addition, other battalions of the Lithuanian auxiliary police, but also local policemen, and other auxiliaries who which less frequently took part in the murder of Jews, but often played a secondary role, security, guarding, and also took part in hunting Jews.[25]

Lithuanian police battalions were also involved in mass murders in Belarus, Ukraine, and northwest Russia.[25][26] The 2nd and 252nd auxiliary police battalions were also sent to Poland for guard duty at the Majdanek concentration camp.[27] Probably the largest action of the Lithuanian police against the non-Jewish population was the murder of some 400 Poles in the Święciany massacre in May 1942.[26] During the war, between 13,000 and 15,000 served in the 28 battalions of the Lithuanian auxiliary police.[28]

The Germans, after the frontline fighting had died down, organized their own administration in Lithuania. The General Region (Generalbezirk) of Lithuania was established, headed by Adrian von Renteln. Together with the other Baltic states, it formed the Reich Commission East (Reichskommissariat Ostland), headed by Hinrich Lohse.[29] The Lithuanian division of local administration of June 1940, restored by the Lithuanian insurgents, was preserved, and the positions were also retained by the local Lithuanian activists they elevated to power.[29] The Germans employed 900 people in the civil administration in early 1944, in addition, about 20,000 Lithuanians worked in their own administrative
bodies.[30] The administrative apparatus was headed by Gen. Petras Kubiliūnas. Kubiliūnas based the administrative apparatus on former members of the Provisional Government and Voldemarists.[31]

The Lithuanian municipal administration was responsible for contacts with Jewish ghettos, as the Germans avoided direct contact with Jews.[32] They also influenced the territorial layout of the ghettos, and was also responsible for the provisioning and security of the ghettos.[33] In the Vilnius region, the Lithuanians used their influential role in the administration to close Polish schools and cultural institutions, Lithuanianize education, and dismiss Polish employees from the administration. The Lithuanian Security Police also collaborated with the Germans in combatting the Polish underground.[34][35] Similar measures were aimed at Belarusians.[36]

Enthusiasm for German rule among the Lithuanian population waned in 1942, due to disillusionment with the lack of real political autonomy, as well as the growing burden of the occupation itself. The first underground organizations appeared. However, much of the Lithuanian administrative and police apparatus continued to operate under German authority until the end of the war.[37]

After an unsuccessful attempt to create a Lithuanian Waffen-SS unit, the Germans attempted to create a military unit of a different kind, in which Lithuanians were to have a little more autonomy, and the unit itself was to be used only within Lithuania to fight Soviet and Polish partisans.[38] The Germans called this unit Lithuanian Special Organizations (Litauische Sonderverbände), while in Lithuanian it was called Local Selection (Vietinė rinktinė).[38] It was headed by pre-war Lithuanian general Povilas Plechavičius.[38] Recruitment for the unit, announced on February 16, 1944, was voluntary and was a complete success and gathered about 20,000 men.[28] The formation of the unit was also supported by the Lithuanian underground.[39] The unit was mostly broken up by the Polish Home Army and then brutally disbanded by the Germans for refusing to defend Germany itself.[39][3]

A significant number of Local Selection members escaped into the forests, but some were conscripted by the Germans into the army, mainly to serve in Luftwaffe auxiliary units. At the beginning of 1945, 37,000 Lithuanians were serving in the ranks of various branches of the German police and army.[40]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_collaboration_with_Nazi_Germany

Visas and Virtue,"Visas and Virtue is a 1997 narrative short film directed by Chris Tashima and starring Chris Tashima, Susan Fukuda, Diana Georger and Lawrence Craig. It was inspired by the true story of Holocaust rescuer Chiune ""Sempo"" Sugihara, who is known as ""The Japanese Schindler"". Sugihara issued over 2,000 transit visas to Polish and Lithuanian Jews from his consulate in Kaunas, Lithuania, in August 1940, in defiance of his own government (Japan), thereby allowing an estimated 6,000 individuals to escape the impending Holocaust.

This film is a dramatization (docu-drama)[1] and contains fictional characters and events. It is not a documentary.  It is based on an original one-act play by Tim Toyama, which was performed at The Road Theatre Company[2] in Los Angeles in 1995.[3]  The play was then adapted by actor/director Chris Tashima in 1996, and completed as a 26-minute film in 1997. The film was produced by Cedar Grove Productions with Visual Communications serving as non-profit sponsor.[4]

Visas and Virtue won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film in March, 1998 (70th Academy Awards). The Oscar statuettes went to actor and director Tashima and producer Chris Donahue.[5]

Haunted by the sight of hundreds of Jewish refugees outside the consulate gates, a Japanese diplomat and his wife, stationed in Kaunas, Lithuania, at the beginning of World War II, must decide how much they are willing to risk. Inspired by a true story, Visas and Virtue explores the moral and professional dilemmas that Consul General Chiune ""Sempo"" Sugihara faces in making a life or death decision: defy his own government's direct orders and risk his career, by issuing life-saving transit visas, or obey orders and turn his back on humanity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visas_and_Virtue

History of Ukraine,"The history of Ukraine spans thousands of years, tracing its roots to the Pontic steppe—one of the key centers of the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages, Indo-European migrations, and early horse domestication. In antiquity, the region was home to the Scythians, followed by the gradual expansion of Slavic tribes. The northern Black Sea coast saw the influence of Greek and Roman colonies, leaving a lasting cultural legacy. Over time, these diverse influences contributed to the development of early political and cultural structures.[1][2][3]

Ukraine enters into written history with the establishment of the medieval state of Kievan Rus'. In Dnieper Ukraine, the tribe of Polans played a key role in the formation of the state, adopting the name Rus' by the 9th century. The term is believed to have connections to the Varangians, who contributed to the state’s early political and military structure.[4][5][6] By the 10th–11th centuries, Kievan Rus' had grown into one of the most powerful and culturally advanced states in Europe, reaching its golden age under Volodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise, who introduced Christianity and strengthened political institutions. However, internal conflicts among Kyivan rulers, along with increasing pressure from Turkic nomads in Southern Ukraine, gradually weakened the state.[7]

In the 13th century, Kievan Rus' suffered devastating destruction during the Mongol invasion, particularly in its Dnieper heartlands. While much of its former territory fell under Mongol control, the Kingdom of Ruthenia (Galicia-Volhynia) emerged as a major center that preserved political and cultural traditions of Rus', especially under King Daniel.[8] Despite continued Mongol dominance in the region, the kingdom retained a degree of autonomy and became a vital repository of Rus' heritage. However, over the subsequent centuries, shifting regional power dynamics gradually transformed the political landscape.[9]

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the majority of Ukrainian territories became part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia, while Galicia and Transcarpathia came under Polish and Hungarian rule. Lithuania kept the local Ruthenian traditions, and was gradually influenced by Ruthenian language, law and culture, until Lithuania itself came under Polish influence, following the Union of Krewo and Union of Lublin, resulting in two countries merging into Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, leaving Ukrainian lands under the dominance of Polish crown.[10] Meanwhile Southern Ukraine was dominated by Golden Horde and then Crimean Khanate, which came under protection of the Ottoman Empire, major regional power in and around Black Sea, which also had some of its own directly-administrated areas as well.[11]

In the 17th century, the Cossack rebellion led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky marked a turning point in Ukraine's history. The uprising, which began in 1648, was fueled by grievances against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's nobility, religious tensions, and social inequalities. This rebellion led to the creation of the Cossack Hetmanate, a semi-autonomous polity in central and eastern Ukraine. In 1654, the Cossack Hetmanate allied with the Tsardom of Moscow through the Pereiaslav Agreement. The nature of this alliance has been widely debated by historians. Some argue that it established a protectorate relationship, with Russia offering military support in exchange for loyalty, while others believe it symbolized the subordination of the Hetmanate to the Tsar. The ambiguity of the treaty's terms and differing interpretations contributed to tensions over the following decades.[12] Over time, the relationship between the Cossack Hetmanate and Russia evolved, with Russia increasingly asserting dominance. This process intensified in the late 17th and 18th centuries, especially after the Truce of Andrusovo, which divided Ukraine between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia.[13]

The Cossack Hetmanate's autonomy was progressively eroded, culminating in its abolition by Catherine the Great in the late 18th century. Simultaneously, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's internal decline and external pressures from neighboring powers facilitated the partitions of Poland. These partitions allowed the Russian Empire to incorporate vast Ukrainian territories, including those previously under Polish control. Western Ukraine, however, came under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy. This division set the stage for the different historical trajectories of Ukrainian lands under Russian and Austrian influence.[14]: 199

The 20th century began with a renewed struggle for Ukrainian statehood. Following the collapse of empires during World War I, the Ukrainian People’s Republic (UPR) was proclaimed in 1917 with Kyiv as its capital. Meanwhile, in the western territories, the West Ukrainian People’s Republic (WUPR) was established in 1918, centered in Lviv. Both republics sought to unite, forming the Unification Act (Act Zluky) on 22 January 1919.[15] However, their independence was short-lived. The UPR faced constant military conflict with Bolshevik forces, Poland, and White Army factions. By 1921, following the Soviet-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian lands were divided: the eastern territories became the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (part of the USSR), while western Ukraine was absorbed by Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.[14]: 537

Under Soviet rule, initial policies of Ukrainianization gave way to oppressive Russification. The Holodomor famine of 1932–1933, a man-made disaster, caused the deaths of 4-5 millions Ukrainians.[16]: §§ 8.1.3  During World War II, Ukraine endured brutal occupations by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) fought for independence, though parts of Ukrainian society also collaborated with occupying forces. Post-war, Soviet control was reestablished, and Crimea was transferred to Ukraine in 1954.

Ukraine became independent when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. This started a period of transition to a market economy, in which Ukraine suffered an eight-year recession.[17] Subsequently however, the economy experienced a high increase in GDP growth until it plunged during the Great Recession.[18] This period was marked by economic challenges, the rise of nationalism, and growing tensions with Russian Federation. In 2013, the Euromaidan protests began in response to President Viktor Yanukovych’s rejection of an EU association agreement. The Revolution of Dignity followed, leading to Yanukovych’s ousting. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and supported separatist movements in Donbas, initiating the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. This escalated on 24 February 2022, with Russia’s full-scale invasion, marking a critical phase in Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The discovery of 1.4-million-year-old stone tools in Korolevo, located in western Ukraine, marks one of the earliest securely dated presences of hominins in Europe. These tools offer crucial insights into the behaviors and adaptive strategies of early members of the genus Homo, likely Homo erectus, as they expanded into the continent during the Lower Paleolithic period.[19] The Neanderthal presence in Ukraine is well-documented through archaeological findings, particularly at the Molodova sites, which are located in the modern-day Chernivtsi region in southwestern Ukraine. These sites, dating to the Middle Paleolithic period (c. 45000 – c. 43000 BC), provide significant evidence of Neanderthal activity. Molodova is known for its rich cultural layers attributed to the Mousterian tradition, showcasing the use of fire, mammoth bone processing, and possible construction of primitive shelters.[20] These sites, located along the Dniester River, are particularly notable for their evidence of advanced behavior. One remarkable feature is the discovery of a dwelling constructed from mammoth bones, a testament to Neanderthal ingenuity and adaptation to harsh Ice Age environments. These structures highlight their ability to organize resources and create durable shelters.[21][22]

The Crimean Mountains hold significant evidence of early modern humans (Homo sapiens) during the Upper Paleolithic period. The Buran-Kaya cave sites have yielded artifacts, such as tools and ornaments, along with skeletal remains, dating to approximately 32,000 BC. These Gravettian settlements reflect a sophisticated hunter-gatherer culture, known for their blade-based lithic technologies and artistic expression. The region likely served as a vital hub for human activity, offering both shelter and access to diverse ecological resources.[23] The archaeological record in Ukraine highlights the area's importance as a crossroads for early human populations migrating through Europe. From the earliest stone tools to evidence of complex social structures and artistic traditions, Ukraine offers a valuable lens into the evolution and adaptation of early humans over hundreds of thousands of years.

The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture (c. 5050 – c. 2950 BC), centered in modern-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, represents one of the most advanced Neolithic civilizations in Europe. These people were known for their impressive settlements, some of which were among the largest in the world at the time, with populations reaching up to 10,000 inhabitants. They built concentric layouts of houses, often using clay and wood, demonstrating advanced planning. They are renowned for their intricate painted ceramics, featuring geometric and symbolic designs in red, black, and white. Their economy was primarily agrarian, complemented by animal husbandry and small-scale trade. Archaeological findings suggest a focus on fertility cults, as evidenced by numerous figurines and symbolic artifacts. The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture began to decline around 3000 BC, possibly due to environmental changes, resource depletion, or pressures from neighboring steppe cultures.[24]

The Sredny Stog culture (c. 4500 – c. 3500 BC) emerged to the east of the Cucuteni–Trypillian zone, on the Pontic–Caspian steppe. It marked a transitional phase between the Neolithic and the emergence of the early Bronze Age steppe cultures. This culture is among the earliest to show evidence of horse domestication, which became a defining feature of steppe societies. Early indications of mound burial (kurgans) began to appear, reflecting evolving social hierarchies and ritual practices. The Sredny Stog culture played a significant role in the genesis of the later Yamna culture.[25]

The Yamna culture (c. 3300 – c. 2600 BC), also known as the Pit Grave culture, was a dominant force in the early Bronze Age across the Pontic–Caspian steppe. This culture is often linked with the spread of Indo-European languages and reflects a shift toward a more mobile, pastoralist lifestyle. The Yamna culture is characterized by its kurgans, often accompanied by grave goods such as weapons, ornaments, and animal sacrifices. The economy relied heavily on livestock, including sheep, cattle, and horses, which supported a semi-nomadic lifestyle. They utilized copper and bronze tools and weapons, demonstrating early metallurgical skills. Many scholars associate the Yamna culture with Proto-Indo-European speakers, as their migrations and cultural diffusion likely influenced vast areas of Europe and Asia.[26]

Following the Yamna culture, the Catacomb culture (c. 2500 – c. 1950 BC) emerged, encompassing much of the same geographic area. It is distinguished by its unique burial practices, where bodies were interred in specially carved niches within grave pits. They further advanced bronze metallurgy, producing a variety of tools, weapons, and ornaments. The Catacomb culture maintained many traditions of the Yamna culture while also interacting with neighboring groups to the west and south.[27]

During the Iron Age, the region witnessed the rise and interaction of diverse peoples and cultures. Following earlier Bronze Age societies, the Dacians, alongside nomadic groups such as the Cimmerians (associated with the Novocherkassk archaeological culture), Scythians, and Sarmatians, dominated the landscape. Among these, the Scythians established a powerful kingdom that flourished between 750 and 250 BC, characterized by their mastery of mounted warfare and trade networks spanning vast territories.[28]

One of the notable events in Scythian history was the campaign of Darius the Great in 513 BC. The Achaemenid Persian king led an expedition aimed at subjugating the Scythians. While the Scythians employed their signature scorched-earth and guerrilla tactics to evade outright defeat, the campaign resulted in the Persian domination of several Thracian peoples and regions along the Black Sea’s northern coast. These territories, encompassing parts of modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and southern Russia, were incorporated into the vast Achaemenid sphere of influence, though direct control remained tenuous.[29][30]

Meanwhile, Greek colonization left a lasting imprint on the region. Beginning in the 7th or 6th century BC during the Archaic period, Greek settlers established colonies along the northern Black Sea coast, including Crimea and parts of modern Ukraine. These colonies, such as Chersonesus and Olbia, served as hubs of trade, cultural exchange, and Hellenic influence. The Bosporan Kingdom, a Greco-Scythian polity formed in this context, became a regional power, blending Greek traditions with local elements. It thrived until the 4th century AD, when invasions by the Goths and later the Huns disrupted its stability.[31][32]

The Roman Empire, expanding its reach into the region, briefly annexed the Bosporan Kingdom from 62 to 68 AD under Emperor Nero. During this period, the reigning Bosporan king, Tiberius Julius Cotys I, was deposed, and the kingdom was directly administered by Rome. Following Nero’s rule, the Bosporan Kingdom was restored as a Roman client state, retaining local governance but under Roman military oversight. This arrangement ensured the region remained within Rome’s economic and strategic sphere during the middle of the 1st century AD.[33][34][35]

In the 3rd century AD, the Goths, a Germanic people originally from Scandinavia, began migrating toward Eastern Europe. By approximately 250 to 375 AD, they had settled in the area of modern Ukraine, which they referred to as Oium. This region is linked to the archaeological Chernyakhov culture, known for its unique mix of local and Gothic influences.[36]

The Goths in this region soon divided into two main groups: the Visigoths (Western Goths) and the Ostrogoths (Eastern Goths). The Ostrogoths established a stronghold in Ukraine but faced significant changes in the 370s with the arrival of the Huns, a nomadic group from Central Asia. The Huns were powerful warriors and ultimately brought the Ostrogoths under their control, leading to major shifts in Gothic society and governance.[37]

To the north of the Ostrogothic territory was the Kyiv culture, a Slavic archaeological culture that thrived from the 2nd to the 5th centuries AD. As the Huns expanded their influence across Eastern Europe, this culture also came under threat. Many Slavic and other local groups were affected by the Hunnic invasions, resulting in changes in settlement patterns and local governance.[38]

In 454 AD, a decisive battle known as the Battle of Nedao marked a turning point. The Ostrogoths, along with other Germanic tribes, rebelled against the Huns and contributed to their defeat. Following this victory, the Ostrogoths were permitted by the Romans to settle in Pannonia (modern-day Hungary), marking their departure from the Ukrainian lands.[39]

Meanwhile, the Black Sea’s northeastern shores were dotted with ancient Greek colonies, such as Tyras, Pontic Olbia, and Hermonassa. Established as early as the 6th century BC, these colonies developed into important cultural and trading centers under Roman and later Byzantine rule. These cities continued to thrive until the 6th century AD, when Byzantine influence began to wane.[40]

In the early 6th century AD, the Bosporan Kingdom on the Crimean Peninsula came under the rule of a Hunnic king named Gordas. Gordas maintained friendly relations with the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, but this ended when Gordas was killed in a local revolt around 527 AD. Justinian seized the opportunity to intervene, occupying the Bosporan Kingdom and further extending Byzantine influence over the region. However, even into the 12th century, Byzantine emperors continued to claim dominion over the Crimean region, known as the Cimmerian Bosporus.[41][42]

Following the power vacuum left by the fall of Hunnic and Gothic dominance, the Early Slavs began to expand over much of the territory that is now Ukraine during the 5th century, continuing their migration into the Balkans in the 6th century. The exact origins of the Early Slavs remain uncertain, though several theories suggest they may have originated near the Polesia region, a marshy area between modern-day Belarus and Ukraine. This period marks a transition from the Kyiv culture to the establishment of Slavic tribes across Eastern Europe.[43]

In the 5th and 6th centuries, the Antes Union (a tribal confederation) is generally believed to have been situated in present-day Ukraine. The Antes are considered ancestors of several Slavic tribes that would later form the Ukrainians, including the Polans, Severians, Drevlians, White Croats, Dulebes, Ulichs, and Tivertsi. The migration of these tribes from Ukraine throughout the Balkans contributed to the foundation of several South Slavic nations, while northern migrations, reaching as far as Lake Ilmen, gave rise to the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, and Radimichs.[44]

The collapse of the Antes Union in 602, following a devastating raid by the Pannonian Avars, led to a fragmentation of the early Slavic federation. Despite this, many of these tribes maintained their distinct identities until the formation of larger political entities in the early second millennium, such as Kievan Rus', which began to consolidate Slavic lands.[44]

The Early Slavs were primarily agrarian, relying on subsistence farming, and lived in semi-nomadic communities. Over time, they developed a complex social structure, with local chieftains leading tribal groups. They also practiced paganism, with a pantheon of gods tied to nature, such as Perun (god of thunder) and Dazhbog (sun god). By the time of the Antes Union's decline, the cultural and religious practices of the Slavs had already begun to influence neighboring peoples, laying the groundwork for the Slavic cultural sphere that would emerge later in Eastern and Southeastern Europe.[45]

In the 7th century, the territory of modern Ukraine was at the core of the state of the Bulgars, often referred to as Old Great Bulgaria. This state, with its capital at Phanagoria (located in what is now the Taman Peninsula), controlled a significant part of the northern Black Sea region. The Bulgars, a semi-nomadic people from Central Asia, were known for their sophisticated society, military organization, and far-reaching influence.[36]

By the end of the 7th century, the Bulgars faced increasing pressure from neighboring tribes and empires. Most of the Bulgar tribes migrated in various directions—some settled in the Balkans, where they eventually established the First Bulgarian Empire. Other groups moved towards the Volga region, forming Volga Bulgaria, which became a prominent center of trade and culture. The remaining parts of Old Great Bulgaria were eventually absorbed by the Khazars, another semi-nomadic people from Central Asia.[36]

The Khazars founded the Khazar Khaganate, a powerful and influential state near the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. The Khaganate's territory expanded to include parts of modern-day western Kazakhstan, eastern Ukraine, southern Russia, and northern Azerbaijan. The Khazars were noted for their religious tolerance and political pragmatism, famously adopting Judaism as their state religion in the 8th century, although Christianity, Islam, and other faiths were also practiced within their borders.[46]

The Khazars played a key role in the politics and economy of Eastern Europe and the Pontic–Caspian steppe. Their control over trade routes contributed to the establishment of the Pax Khazarica, a period of relative peace and stability that fostered safe long-distance trade. This stability allowed traders, including the Radhanite Jews, to operate along vast routes that stretched from China to the Byzantine Empire. These trade routes facilitated the exchange of goods, culture, and ideas across Eurasia.[47]

The origins of the Kievan state and the etymology of its name, Rus', continue to be subjects of scholarly debate. One theory, often called the 'Norman theory', posits that the term Rus' originated from the Scandinavian Varangians, who were active in trade and military ventures across Eastern Europe in the early medieval period. Proponents of this theory argue that the Varangians, also known as the Rus', initially brought a political and military influence that shaped the emerging state structure, with the term Rus' eventually becoming synonymous with the region and its people.[48]

In contrast, the 'anti-Norman theory' suggests that the term Rus' has indigenous Slavic roots, developing independently of Scandinavian influence. Advocates of this theory assert that Eastern Slavic tribes already had established political and social frameworks before any contact with the Varangians, and that these tribes were naturally progressing toward political consolidation. According to this perspective, the name Rus' could be linked to the Ros River, a historically significant waterway flowing through present-day Ukraine, which was home to various Slavic communities. In this view, Rus' may have referred to a collective identity tied to a specific geographic region or a union of native tribes, rather than to foreign invaders or rulers.[49][50]

The first reliable mention of the Rus' dates back to the year 839 in the Frankish chronicle Annals of St. Bertin, where members of an embassy from the north, arriving in the Byzantine Empire, referred to themselves as Rus'.[51] The second notable mention of the Rus' occurred in 860, when they launched a bold and unexpected naval raid on Constantinople. Commanding a fleet across the Black Sea, the Rus' forces struck at the very heart of the Byzantine Empire, quickly reaching the city’s outskirts. According to accounts from Greek eyewitnesses, the Rus' not only managed to pillage the suburbs of Constantinople but also instilled widespread fear among its residents. The Byzantine defenses were unprepared, allowing the Rus' to withdraw without significant resistance.[52]

The earliest source about the history of the Dnieper Ukraine region is the Tale of Bygone Years (or Primary Chronicle), written no earlier than the 11th century. In its 'legendary' part, it narrates the Rus' raid on Constantinople and the formation of a state centered in Kiev during the second half of the 9th century. The Chronicle, in particular, mentions the names of the leaders of the raid on Constantinople — Askold and Dir — and calls them retainers of the Scandinavian Rurik dynasty. According to the Chronicle, a representative of this dynasty, Oleg the Wise, allegedly came to Kiev from Novgorod in 882, killed Askold and Dir, and took control of the Kiev state. This narrative contains chronological errors—for example, it incorrectly dates the Constantinople raid to 867—and lacks corroboration from archaeological evidence, which suggests that Novgorod itself was only established in the 10th century. Therefore, modern historians view the Chronicle's account of the 9th century as largely speculative and likely a later construction by the Chronicle's author.[53][54]

Scholars associate the state-building processes in the Middle Dnieper region with the emergence of the well-known trade route from Scandinavia to Constantinople, known as the 'Route from the Varangians to the Greeks'. A significant section of this route ran along the Dnieper River, and Kiev was an important transshipment point, allowing control over trade along the Dnieper, Pripyat, and Desna rivers.[56] The Middle Dnieper region began to serve as a political, cultural, and economic center for the East Slavic world. It eventually came to be known as the Rus' land in the narrow sense of this term.[55] According to The Tale of Bygone Years, the East Slavic tribe of the Polans, inhabitants of the Middle Dnieper region, adopted the name Rus' for their land and were regarded as the most advanced among the East Slavs. Thus, they played a central role in forming a new tribal union centered around Kiev.[57]

From the first half of the 10th century, the first confirmed ruler of the Kievan state, as documented in foreign sources, was Igor the Old, whom the Primary Chronicle identifies as a prince. Information in the Chronicle regarding governance during this period is considered relatively reliable. The princely retinue played a significant role in governance, accompanying rulers on campaigns and collecting tribute from subjugated local Slavic tribes. The collected tribute (such as furs, honey, hides, wax, and slaves) was mainly exported to Byzantium, with the proceeds used to purchase weapons, luxury goods, and wine—constituting the core of imports. When trade conditions no longer met the prince's expectations, he led an unsuccessful campaign against Constantinople in 941, which eventually resulted in a new Rus-Byzantine trade treaty in 944. The Tale of Bygone Years recounts Igor's attempt to levy additional tribute from the subdued Slavs, which led to a rebellion by the Drevlians, who killed him in 945.[58]

Following Igor's death in 945, his widow, Princess Olga, assumed the role of regent for their young son, Sviatoslav, who was still too young to rule. Olga is best known for her calculated and fierce retaliation against the Drevlians, a campaign that culminated in the annexation of their lands into the expanding Kievan Rus'. Olga also implemented significant reforms, particularly by restructuring the tribute collection system known as poliudie. This new system made revenue collection more systematic and centralized, reducing the likelihood of rebellion by ensuring a more balanced distribution of power. In a landmark decision, Olga became the first ruler of Kievan Rus' to embrace Christianity around 957 during a diplomatic visit to Constantinople. However, despite her conversion, the state under her rule remained predominantly pagan, with Christianity gaining influence only later under her descendants.[59][60]

When Sviatoslav assumed rule over Kievan Rus', he launched an ambitious military expansion. His most notable achievement was the decisive defeat of the Khazar Khaganate, a once-dominant regional power that had controlled key trade routes for centuries. The fall of the Khazars opened opportunities for Kievan Rus' to extend its influence into the Caucasus and beyond. In addition to his campaigns in the east, Sviatoslav waged numerous battles against the Byzantine Empire, seeking to establish Kievan Rus' as a formidable power in the Balkans. His primary goal was to create a lasting base in Bulgaria, strengthening his strategic position in southeastern Europe. However, his ambitions in the Balkans were thwarted after a Byzantine counterattack. In 972, while returning from his Balkan campaign, Sviatoslav was ambushed and killed by the Pechenegs near the Dnieper River.[61][62]

After Sviatoslav's death, a power struggle ensued among his sons. Yaropolk, Sviatoslav's eldest son, assumed the title of Grand Prince of Kiev and worked to consolidate power across the vast territory, leading to conflicts with his brothers. Oleg, Sviatoslav's second son, governed the Drevlian lands, and rivalry between him and Yaropolk escalated into open warfare. During one of their clashes around 977, Oleg was killed, further intensifying the conflict. Initially, Vladimir, Sviatoslav's youngest son, fled to avoid being entangled in the conflict. However, after Oleg's death, he returned with a Varangian army. By 980, Vladimir had defeated Yaropolk and consolidated power, becoming the sole ruler of Kievan Rus'.[63]

During the reign of Vladimir the Great, Kievan Rus' expanded significantly, notably through the conquest and annexation of Red Ruthenia, Transcarpathia, and Korsun. These territorial gains made Kievan Rus' the largest state in Europe at the time, covering over 800,000 square kilometers and boasting a population of more than 5 million. The socio-economic structure of Kievan Rus' was similar to that of other European states of the period, characterized by a natural economy, communal land ownership, and reliance on slash-and-burn agriculture, and animal husbandry.[64]

Vladimir reformed local governance by abolishing the traditional tribal autonomies and installing his own appointed governors, further centralizing his authority. Under his rule, Kiev emerged as one of the wealthiest commercial centers in Europe during the 10th and 11th centuries, benefiting from its strategic location on trade routes and its growing political influence. Initially, Vladimir supported the worship of Slavic deities such as Perun. However, in 988, he made a historic decision to convert Kievan Rus' to Christianity, adopting Eastern Orthodoxy from the Byzantine Empire. He personally led the mass baptism of the people of Kiev in the Pochaina River and built the first stone church in Kievan Rus' — Church of the Tithes. He also introduced the Charter on Church Courts and Tithes, thereby securing a strong relationship between the church and state. Unlike the earlier attempts of his grandmother, Princess Olga, Vladimir's reforms had a lasting impact, deeply influencing the religious and cultural development of the region.[65]

Vladimir's rule also saw administrative, monetary, and military reforms. He appointed governors and entrusted his sons with ruling major cities, also minted his own gold (Zlatnik) and silver (Srebrenik) coins, and granted borderlands to loyal vassals in exchange for military defense. To protect the realm, Vladimir oversaw the construction of an extensive system of defensive fortifications, known as the Serpent's Walls, which stretched for 1,000 kilometers, safeguarding Kievan Rus' from external threats.[66]

Despite these accomplishments, Kievan Rus' entered a turbulent period of internal strife following Vladimir's death in 1015, as his sons fought for control. This era of internecine conflict lasted until 1019, when Yaroslav the Wise emerged victorious and assumed the throne. Ruling jointly with his brother Mstislav until 1036, Yaroslav presided over what is often regarded as the golden age of Kievan Rus'. One of Yaroslav's key achievements was his decisive defeat of the Pechenegs, who had long been a threat to the state. To commemorate this victory, Yaroslav ordered the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, a structure that still stands as a symbol of this prosperous era. He also founded the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and supported the election of  Hilarion of Kiev as the Kyiv Metropolitan, marking a significant step in the independence of the Kievan church. Yaroslav's reign was also notable for the introduction of the first written legal code — Rus' Truth, which established a foundation for legal governance in the state. Additionally, Yaroslav engaged in extensive marriage diplomacy, forming alliances by arranging marriages between his daughters and European royalty.[67][68] However, after Yaroslav's death, Kievan Rus' began to fragment, as his sons divided the territory among themselves, leading to further internecine conflicts and the eventual decline of centralized power.[69]

The feudal fragmentation of Kievan Rus' began in the late 11th century, driven by a complex interplay of internal and external factors. One significant factor was the rotational succession system, allowing power to pass among male relatives instead of directly from father to son. This system often sparked conflicts, as competing claims to power emerged. With princes often granted specific territories, autonomous principalities began to emerge clearly. Regional cities such as Chernihiv, Polotsk, and Novgorod gained power and asserted their independence, with local elites increasing their influence. By this time, the authority of the Grand Prince of Kiev was notably weakening. Regional princes, bolstered by local resources and armies, began to resist central control. Additionally, the vast geography and economic diversity of Rus' impeded unity, as various regions developed their own trade routes and systems. External threats from nomadic groups, such as the Pechenegs and Polovtsy (Cumans), further exacerbated regionalism, compelling local rulers to focus on defending their territories.[70][71]

After Yaroslav the Wise's death, his sons divided the lands, which significantly accelerated political fragmentation. Although his succession plan aimed to prevent conflict, it ultimately sowed the seeds of feudal division. The Council of Liubech, convened by several princes, including Vladimir Monomakh, sought to settle disputes and clarify the inheritance of principalities. This agreement formalized Kievan Rus's division into regional hereditary principalities, thereby legalizing fragmentation. The adage ""Let everyone hold his own"" emerged, signifying that each prince would govern his own territory without interference from others.[72]

Vladimir Monomakh, who served as Grand Prince of Kiev from 1113 to 1125, is remembered as one of Kievan Rus' most capable leaders. He ascended the throne amid internal strife and external threats, yet worked diligently to stabilize the fragmented territories of Rus'. Monomakh's reign achieved relative unity through efforts to reduce feuds among princes and reinforce central authority. His military successes, particularly against the Polovtsy (Cumans), secured the region's borders. Diplomatically, he forged strong ties with Europe, notably through his marriage to Gytha of Wessex, the daughter of English King Harold II. As an educated ruler, Monomakh authored The Instruction of Vladimir Monomakh, offering insights on governance, morality, and leadership. His reign is often regarded as one of the last periods of unity before Rus' descended further into division.[73][74]

Monomakh's son, Mstislav the Great, preserved some unity during his reign from 1125 to 1132. However, following his death, the principality fractured. The division of lands among Monomakh's sons and other relatives resulted in multiple competing power centers.[75][76] The process of feudal fragmentation marked a turning point in the history of Rus', culminating in its eventual decline and the rise of smaller, more independent states. These would later evolve into the medieval powers of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, the Principality of Polotsk, the Novgorod Republic, and others.[77][78][79][80]

In 1222, a new wave of nomads—the warlike Mongols—arrived in the Black Sea steppes and defeated the Polovtsians as part of the Mongol Empire's westward expansion. The Polovtsians, who had family ties with the Rus' princes, turned to Rus' for help. A joint Rus'-Polovtsian force marched into the steppes, where the Battle of the Kalka River took place in 1223. Following the battle, the Mongols retreated eastward for approximately 15 years.[81]

In the late 1230s, the Mongols returned with significantly larger forces under the leadership of Batu Khan and his general Subutai. The Mongols first attacked the eastern regions of the state, using superior siege tactics to overwhelm local defenses. Between 1239 and 1240, the Mongols shifted their focus to the southern territories. In 1240, they laid siege to Kiev, which ultimately fell after a brutal assault, marking the final collapse of Kievan Rus' as a unified political entity.[82][83]

As a result of this invasion, Kievan Rus' was extensively destroyed, depopulated, and fragmented. Following their conquest, the Mongols established dominion over the region through the Golden Horde, transforming most of the Rus' principalities into tributary states. Under Mongol rule, the Rus' were required to pay heavy taxes and submit to Mongol authority. The invasion severely stunted the region's political, cultural, and economic development, and the effects of Mongol domination reverberated for centuries. Despite its devastation, the Eastern Orthodox Church played an important role in preserving cultural identity during Mongol rule.[84][85]

The Principality—later the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (Ruthenia)—emerged from the disintegration of Kievan Rus'. Its rulers continued the political and cultural legacy of Kiev, preserving the traditions and governance of the Rus' state even as Kiev fell to Mongol control.[8][86] Previously, Vladimir the Great had established the cities of Halych and Volodymyr as regional capitals, setting the foundation for future political entities in the region. The area was originally inhabited by the Dulebes, Tivertsi, and White Croats tribes.[87] Initially, Volhynia and Galicia existed as separate principalities, each ruled by descendants of Yaroslav the Wise. Galicia was governed by the Rostislavich dynasty, while Volhynia was initially ruled by the Igorevichs and eventually by the Iziaslavich dynasty.[88] During the reign of Yaroslav Osmomysl (1153–1187), Galicia expanded its influence, extending as far as the Black Sea.[88]

Rivalry between the rulers of these principalities often revolved around efforts to assert dominance over one another. This conflict was finally resolved by Roman the Great (1197–1205), who not only succeeded in uniting Galicia and Volhynia under his rule but also briefly extended his authority over Kiev. Roman's consolidation of power laid the groundwork for the rise of the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia, which became a significant political force in the region.[89]

Following Roman's death, a period of unrest ensued, lasting until his son Daniel Romanovich reclaimed the throne in 1238. Daniel successfully restored his father's state, including Kiev. In 1240, the Mongol Empire, led by Batu Khan, unleashed devastating invasions across Kievan Rus'. Cities like Kiev were sacked, leaving much of the region in ruins. Daniel's decisive victory at the Battle of Yaroslavl in 1245 ended internal conflicts and firmly secured his control over the state. By 1246, Daniel was compelled to recognize Mongol supremacy to safeguard his state. Though this submission was humiliating, it allowed Daniel to retain some degree of autonomy, provided he paid tribute to the Mongol khan.[90]

Despite this subjugation, Daniel remained determined to free Ruthenia from Mongol dominance. He sought support from Western Europe, forging diplomatic ties with the Papacy, Poland, Hungary, and the Holy Roman Empire. In 1253, Daniel was crowned King of Ruthenia (Latin: Rex Rusiae) by a papal legate in Drohiczyn, receiving formal recognition from Pope Innocent IV. This coronation symbolized Ruthenia's alignment with Western Europe and its Christian identity, while still adhering to the Orthodox faith. The crowning also carried the hope of an anti-Mongol alliance, though such a coalition never materialized due to political divisions in Western Europe.[91] King Daniel also founded numerous cities that became hubs of trade, culture, and military strength. Among his most notable achievements were the establishments of Lviv, named after his son Lev, and Kholm. These urban centers not only revitalized the kingdom's economy but also helped Daniel consolidate his political authority over the region.[92][93]

After King Daniel Romanovych's death in 1264, the kingdom was inherited by his son, Lev Danylovych. Lev I ruled from 1269 to 1301 and relocated the capital from Kholm to Lviv. He continued his father's policies of defending the kingdom against external threats, particularly from the Mongols, while also striving to maintain alliances with Poland and Lithuania to counterbalance Mongol influence. Although Lev managed to preserve the state's territorial integrity, the kingdom's power gradually eroded under the relentless pressure from the Mongol Golden Horde and ongoing internal political challenges.[94][95] Following Lev's death in 1301, his son, Yuri Lvovych, ascended the throne and ruled until 1308. During his reign, Yuri I succeeded in maintaining relative stability, yet the kingdom's political position had significantly weakened compared to the time of Daniel. Despite his efforts, Yuri's reign was short-lived, and after his death, the kingdom entered a period of fragmentation.[96]

Yuri's sons, Andrew and Lev II, attempted to co-rule, but their efforts to sustain the kingdom's unity and strength ultimately failed. The Mongol Golden Horde continued to exert substantial influence over the weakened Kingdom of Ruthenia throughout the 14th century.[97][98] After the deaths of the co-rulers around 1323, the kingdom found itself without strong leadership. Yuri II Boleslav, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, took power following the demise of the Romanovych line. Reigning from 1323 to 1340, he was a member of the Polish Piast dynasty, chosen as king due to his maternal connection to the Ruthenian royal family—his mother, Maria, was the daughter of Lev I.[99] Upon ascending the throne, Boleslav converted to Orthodox Christianity and adopted the name Yuriy to garner support from the local Orthodox nobility. However, his reign was fraught with tension due to his Catholic background, which clashed with the predominantly Orthodox Ruthenian elite. During his rule, Yuriy II struggled to balance the competing interests of Poland, Lithuania, and the Mongol Golden Horde, while also introducing pro-Catholic policies that alienated the local nobility. His rule culminated in his assassination in 1340 by Ruthenian nobles discontented with his leadership. His death triggered a fierce power struggle between Poland and Lithuania for control over the region. Soon after, Galicia was annexed by Poland, and Volhynia fell under Lithuanian rule, marking the end of the independent Kingdom of Ruthenia.[9]

From the 13th century onwards, parts of Ukraine’s Black Sea called Genoese Gazaria came under the influence of the Republic of Genoa, which established fortified trading colonies. These included key settlements such as Caffa (modern Feodosia), Soldaia (modern Sudak), and others in today’s Odesa Oblast. These fortresses, heavily guarded by Genoese garrisons, functioned as hubs for maritime trade and ensured Genoa's control over Black Sea commerce. The Genoese dominance, however, faced challenges from neighboring powers and ended with the Ottoman conquest in 1475.[100][101][102]

In 1322, Pope John XXII established a Catholic diocese in Caffa (modern-day Feodosia), marking the only Catholic stronghold within Mongol-controlled territories. It served as a central religious authority from the Balkans to the capital of the Golden Horde, Sarai. The Genoese settlements were not only economic centers but also a point of cultural and religious interaction between Europe, the Mongol Empire, and the Middle East.[103]

By the mid-14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into the territories of modern Ukraine. After the decisive Battle of the Blue Waters against the Golden Horde (1362/63), Lithuania annexed Polotsk, Volhynia, Chernihiv, and Kyiv. Lithuanian rulers adhered to the principle “We do not disturb the old, nor do we introduce the new”, which allowed local Ruthenian (Ukrainian) traditions, religion, and administration to remain largely intact. The Lithuanian rulers styled themselves as “rulers of Rus’”, integrating Ruthenian traditions and governance into their system. This integration included Ruthenian aristocrats, like the Olelkovich family, who became influential in the Lithuanian administration. Old Church Slavonic and Ruthenian served as primary administrative languages alongside Latin.[104]

Simultaneously, Poland began asserting influence over western Ukraine. Red Ruthenia, parts of Volhynia, and Podolia were incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland, and the Polish monarch adopted the title ""lord and heir of Ruthenia"" (Latin: Russiae dominus et Heres).[105] Meanwhile, Kingdom of Hungary also maintained influence, particularly over Zakarpattia (Transcarpathia) and parts of Bessarabia. The Hungarian Crown controlled these regions, fostering Magyarization and Catholic influence while integrating them into the Hungary’s political and economic system.[106]

Since the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania had developed a unique and evolving relationship, often defined by dynastic unions, military alliances, and shared geopolitical interests, particularly in countering external threats. These included the aggressive expansion of the Teutonic Knights in the Baltic region and the rise of the Principality of Moscow to the east. The need for mutual support in the face of these common enemies gradually led the two states toward closer cooperation. This relationship reached a decisive turning point with the Union of Krewo in 1385, which marked the beginning of a new political era. Through the marriage of Jadwiga of Poland, the Queen of Poland, and Władysław II Jagiełło, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Grand Duchy was brought under Polish influence. This union was not just a political arrangement but a dynastic consolidation, with Jagiełło converting to Christianity and agreeing to unite Lithuania with Poland under his rule. This union established the Jagiellonian dynasty, which would go on to rule both Poland and Lithuania for several generations. The creation of this shared monarchy laid the foundation for an increasingly intertwined relationship between the two states, leading to greater cooperation in military, political, and cultural matters.[107][108]

In the early 15th century, tensions within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia over the governance of the Rus' lands intensified. These tensions escalated into a power struggle following the death of Grand Duke Vytautas in 1430. Vytautas had been a powerful and unifying figure, and his passing left a power vacuum that deepened divisions within the Lithuanian elite. Two main contenders for the throne emerged: Švitrigaila, who had the support of the Orthodox Rus' nobility, and Sigismund Kęstutaitis, who represented the Catholic Lithuanian elite.[109] In 1432, Sigismund Kęstutaitis declared himself the new Grand Duke of Lithuania. To consolidate his rule and gain favor with the Rus' lands, he proclaimed the creation of a new political entity—the Grand Principality of Rus' (1432—1435) [uk]. This new formation was intended to include several important regions, such as Volhynia, Podolia, Siveria, Berestia, and Dnieper Ukraine, with Kyiv as its capital. Despite this declaration, Švitrigaila remained formally the head of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and sought to transform the Rus' lands into an independent state under his control. His ambition to sever the ties with the rest of the Grand Duchy sparked a civil war that raged from 1432 to 1435, plunging Lithuania into internal conflict.[110]

Švitrigaila's forces, which included early Cossack, sought external support from the Teutonic Order, which had its own interests in weakening both Poland and Lithuania. The Teutonic Order's involvement further complicated the political situation. However, Sigismund Kęstutaitis found strong backing from Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), as well as from the majority of the Lithuanian nobility. This external support proved pivotal in the conflict, tipping the scales in Sigismund's favor. The turning point in the war came with the Battle of Wiłkomierz (modern-day Ukmergė, Lithuania) on September 1, 1435. This battle was one of the largest and most decisive military engagements in Eastern Europe during the 15th century. Švitrigaila's forces were decisively defeated, suffering a crushing blow that effectively ended the Grand Principality of Rus'. The defeat led to the collapse of Švitrigaila's short-lived state and ensured the continuation of Lithuanian rule over the Rus' lands. With the victory, Sigismund Kęstutaitis solidified his power as Grand Duke, and the Rus' territories were once again integrated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, these lands would now be firmly under Lithuanian control, with no 
significant autonomy for the Rus' people. The failure of the Grand Principality of Rus' also marked a significant shift in the governance of the region, as the aspirations of the Rus' nobility for greater independence were suppressed.[110]

Southwestern Crimea saw the emergence of the Principality of Theodoro, also known as Gothia, a Byzantine successor state. Centered in Doros (modern Mangup), Theodoro was a multi-ethnic entity populated by Greeks, Goths, Alans, and others. Its rulers maintained close ties with the Byzantine Empire and the Empire of Trebizond. The principality acted as a buffer between Genoese colonies and the expanding Crimean Khanate. Despite its strong fortifications, Theodoro was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1475, as the Ottomans sought full dominance over the Black Sea region.[111]

The increasing dominance of the Polish nobility over Ukrainian lands in the late 15th century sparked resistance, most notably Mukha’s Rebellion in 1490. Led by Petro Mukha and supported by Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, the uprising involved early Cossacks, Hutsuls, and Romanians (Moldavians). Mukha’s forces captured several towns in Pokuttya and advanced toward Lviv, though they failed to take the city. The rebellion, while ultimately suppressed, revealed growing dissatisfaction among Ukrainians under foreign rule and foreshadowed future uprisings in the region.[112]

As the Golden Horde declined in the 15th century, the Crimean Khanate emerged as a dominant power in the southern Ukrainian steppe. Centered around the city of Bakhchisarai, the Khanate controlled much of the Black Sea coastline, including key ports and strategic territories in what is today southern Ukraine. This rise to power marked a significant shift in the region, as the Crimean Khanate not only played a key military and political role but also became a vital player in the economy of the Black Sea and beyond.[113][114]

From the early 16th century to the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate was deeply involved in the region’s slave trade, which became one of its main economic drivers. The Khanate, often acting as an intermediary between the steppes and the Ottoman Empire, exported an estimated 2 million slaves to slavery in the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East between 1500 and 1700. These slaves, many of whom were captured in raids on neighboring lands, were primarily sold to the Ottoman Empire, where they were used in various sectors, including the military, households, and harems.[115]

Despite its growing power, the Crimean Khanate remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire throughout much of its history. This relationship provided the Khanate with military support and protection, but also limited its autonomy. The Crimean Khanate’s role as a vassal did not diminish its influence, however, and it continued to exert significant control over the Black Sea region until the late 18th century.[116]

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, which united the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Ukrainian lands transitioned under Polish administration, becoming part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The union was driven by the need to counter external threats, primarily the growing aggression of Tsardom of Moscow and persistent raids by the Teutonic Order, prompting both states to consolidate their resources and strengthen their defenses. This political shift marked a significant transformation of Ukraine's social, economic, and cultural landscape. Polish authorities initiated large-scale colonization efforts, resulting in the foundation of numerous new towns and villages, particularly in the steppe regions. Settlers brought new legal norms, governance practices, and economic models, integrating Ukrainian lands more closely into the Commonwealth's political system.[117][118]

At the same time, Renaissance ideas began to permeate Ukrainian society, driven by the spread of new schools and educational institutions, which were often established by the Jesuits. The arrival of Polish settlers in large numbers led to cultural assimilation. Over time, a significant portion of the Ukrainian nobility became 'polonized', adopting Polish customs, language, and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, the majority of Ruthenian-speaking peasants remained loyal to the Eastern Orthodox Church, which caused growing social and religious tensions. Polish influence extended not only politically but also culturally. Some polonized Ukrainian nobles, such as Stanisław Orzechowski, made notable contributions to Polish intellectual and cultural life, writing influential works on theology, law, and politics. These changes contributed to the fragmentation of Ukrainian society, as the gap between the Catholic, Polish-speaking nobility and the Orthodox, Ruthenian-speaking peasants widened, creating the foundations for future conflicts.[119][120]

The incorporation of Kyiv, Volhynia, Podolia, and Bratslav lands into the Crown also strengthened internal connections between various Ukrainian regions. New trade routes and urban centers facilitated greater economic, social, and cultural interaction across these previously fragmented territories, fostering regional cohesion. However, despite the spread of Polish culture and governance, the Ukrainian population maintained a distinct identity rooted in Orthodox traditions and Ruthenian language, which became a key factor in their resistance to cultural assimilation.[121]

At the same time, the harsh conditions imposed on Ruthenian peasants by the Polish nobility sparked widespread resistance. As serfdom expanded and economic exploitation intensified, many peasants fled to the borderlands of the Dnipro region, seeking freedom and a better life. These frontier settlers became known as Cossacks, forming a distinct social and military group known for their martial prowess, independence, and deep ties to the Orthodox faith. The Cossacks quickly gained a reputation as skilled warriors, adept at defending the southeastern borders of the Commonwealth from Tatar raids. Recognizing their military value, the Polish authorities enlisted Cossacks into the Commonwealth’s army, particularly for the defense of frontier regions, and granted them limited privileges through the creation of the Registered Cossacks in the late 16th century. Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, one of the most prominent Cossack leaders, played a decisive role in the Battle of Khotyn in 1621, where the Commonwealth, with Cossack support, repelled a massive Ottoman army. His leadership and diplomatic efforts also strengthened ties with the Orthodox Church, as he sought to restore the Church’s influence in Ukrainian society.[122]

However, despite their significant contributions to the Commonwealth’s military victories, the Cossacks were denied substantial political or social autonomy. The Szlachta (Polish nobility), which dominated the Commonwealth’s political system, viewed the Cossacks as a disruptive and uncontrollable force, refusing to recognize them as a distinct social class. Instead, the nobility made repeated attempts to reduce the Cossacks to the status of serfs, depriving them of their privileges and freedoms. This ongoing marginalization and denial of rights led to a series of Cossack uprisings, as they sought to defend their autonomy, way of life, and religious identity. Notable rebellions included the Kosiński Uprising (1591-1593) and the Nalyvaiko Uprising (1594-1596), both of which were brutally suppressed by the Polish authorities. These rebellions, however, underscored the growing discontent among the Cossacks and highlighted the tension between the Commonwealth’s central government and the frontier population.[123]

By the early 17th century, the situation became increasingly volatile, with Cossack demands for recognition of their rights being continuously ignored. The Commonwealth's refusal to integrate the Cossacks politically and respect their distinct cultural and religious identity ultimately set the stage for larger conflicts, most notably the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648, also known as the Cossack–Polish War,[124] which profoundly reshaped the political landscape of Eastern Europe.[125]

The Cossack Hetmanate, also known as the Hetmanate of Ukraine, was a self-governing Cossack state that existed between 1649 and 1764. It arose during a particularly volatile era in Eastern European history, following the seismic upheaval of the Khmelnytsky Uprising. This revolt, led by the charismatic and astute military leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky, sought to liberate Ukrainian lands from the dominion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The rebellion not only destabilized one of Europe’s most prominent states at the time but also triggered a broader period of chaos in the region, known in Ukrainian history as the ""Ruin"", while in Polish historiography it is referred to as ""the Deluge"".[127]

The establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate in 1649 marked a pivotal shift in the political landscape of Eastern Europe. Officially recognized through the Treaty of Zboriv that same year, the Hetmanate emerged as a semi-autonomous entity within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Yet, this fragile self-governance was immediately tested by a turbulent geopolitical environment. The state found itself entangled in a web of diplomatic and military conflicts involving major regional powers, including the Ottoman Empire, the Commonwealth, the Crimean Khanate, and the Tsardom of Moscow. For these competing entities, the Hetmanate was not just a potential ally, but also a strategic prize, which complicated its quest for sovereignty and stability.[127]

As ruler of the Hetmanate, Khmelnytsky engaged in state-building across multiple spheres: military, administration, finance, economics, and culture. He invested the Zaporozhian Host under the leadership of its hetman with supreme power in the new Ruthenian state, and he unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. This involved building a government system and a developed military and civilian administration out of Cossack officers and Ruthenian nobles, as well as the establishment of an elite within the Cossack Hetman state.[128]

In 1654, under the continuous pressure of Poland and in pursuit of a more secure route to sovereignty, the Cossack leadership, headed by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, entered into the Pereiaslav Agreement with the Tsardom of Russia. This pact positioned the Hetmanate under the Russian protection, signaling a significant shift in the region’s balance of power. While the agreement initially promised mutual military support and guaranteed a degree of autonomy for the Cossacks, it also laid the groundwork for Russia's gradual encroachment on Ukrainian governance. Over time, the aspirations of the Hetmanate for true independence were systematically undermined, as the Tsardom’s ambitions to consolidate control over the territory took precedence.[129][127]

Efforts to reclaim autonomy and negotiate favorable terms with neighboring powers continued, culminating in the 1658 Treaty of Hadiach. This ambitious agreement aimed to elevate the Hetmanate to the status of the Grand Principality of Rus', an equal partner within the Commonwealth alongside Poland and Lithuania. While the treaty represented a significant step toward reconciliation, it was ultimately derailed by fierce Russian opposition and deep-seated divisions within the Ukrainian leadership. Moreover, the agreement failed to stabilize the region, as ongoing conflicts, including Russian military campaigns and internal unrest, plunged the Hetmanate into over a decade of turmoil, leaving its aspirations for autonomy unfulfilled.[130][131]

The Truce of Andrusovo in 1667 marked a pivotal moment in Ukrainian history, as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia formalized an agreement to partition the Hetmanate's territories along the Dnieper River. Under the terms of the treaty, Right-Bank Ukraine was returned to Polish control, while Left-Bank Ukraine, including Kyiv, was ceded to Russia. Although the Hetmanate retained a nominal degree of autonomy on the Left Bank, this autonomy was heavily constrained by Russian oversight. The division not only symbolized the beginning of a new long-term foreign domination of Ukrainian lands, but also violated the unity of the Cossack state. This fragmentation further weakened the Hetmanate's capacity to resist external pressures and maintain its independence, leaving it increasingly vulnerable to the ambitions of neighboring powers.[127]

The late 17th century was characterized by civil strife, foreign intervention, and territorial shifts. From 1657 to 1686, the region was embroiled in nearly constant conflict, with neighboring powers, including the Ottoman Empire, Poland, and Russia, capitalizing on Ukraine's vulnerability. During this period, Hetman Petro Doroshenko, a prominent Cossack leader, sought to consolidate control over key territories such as Kyiv and Bratslav. However, his ambitions were thwarted as these areas fell under Turkish occupation, further complicating the geopolitical landscape.[132]

In the broader context, the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 played a pivotal role in redefining territorial control. It resulted in the return of much of the land previously held by the Ottomans to Polish authority. Despite this, Ukrainian Cossack forces, especially in the frontier regions of Zaporizhzhia and Sloboda Ukraine, managed to maintain a degree of autonomy. Semi-independent Cossack republics in these areas continued to challenge both Polish and Russian dominance, asserting their independence and preserving distinct cultural and political identities.[132]

In addition to political turbulence, the Hetmanate played a pivotal role in the cultural and intellectual development of both Ukraine and Russia during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Ukrainian clerics, scholars, and intellectuals, many of whom were educated at the esteemed Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, served as key agents of cultural exchange and reform. Their influence was particularly pronounced during the reign of Peter the Great, as they introduced new ideas and approaches that helped modernize Russian society. Figures such as Theophan Prokopovich and Stefan Yavorsky, both leading members of the Most Holy Synod, played an important role in shaping religious and educational reforms in Russia. The intellectual movement often referred to as the 'Ukrainian school' left a lasting imprint on Russian literature, theology, and pedagogy, becoming a dominant force in the region's cultural landscape.[133][134]

A critical turning point in Ukraine's religious history occurred in 1686, when the Metropolis of Kyiv was annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate. This event symbolized the consolidation of Moscow's influence over Ukrainian religious and cultural life. This annexation was a significant step towards the gradual erosion of Ukrainian ecclesiastical independence. Nonetheless, the Hetmanate's leadership continued to assert their autonomy, navigating complex political realities to safeguard their unique identity and governance. The interplay between cooperation and resistance defined this era, highlighting Ukraine's dual role as both a cultural sponsor of Moscovy's reforms and a defender of its own sovereignty.[135]

The Hetmanate reached its peak of independence under the leadership of Hetman Ivan Mazepa, a complex and ambitious figure in Ukrainian history. Seeking to assert the autonomy of the Hetmanate, Mazepa pursued an alliance with the Swedish Empire during the Great Northern War (1700–1721), hoping to break free from Russian dominance. His decision to align with Charles XII of Sweden was a bold but perilous move, rooted in the desire to safeguard Ukrainian sovereignty and escape the tightening grip of Moscow.[136]

The turning point came in 1708, when the Moscovy's army, under orders from Tsar Peter I, sacked the Hetmanate's capital city, Baturyn. The brutal assault resulted in the massacre of thousands of defenders and civilians, with many burned alive or executed in other horrific ways. This act of retribution was a devastating blow to Mazepa's efforts, as it not only destroyed the administrative and military center of the Hetmanate but also served as a warning to other potential dissenters.[137] Mazepa's rebellion culminated in the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, where the combined Swedish-Ukrainian forces were decisively crushed by Peter's army. The aftermath of Poltava marked the end of Mazepa's aspirations for Ukrainian independence and significantly tightened Russia's control over the Hetmanate. The rebellion's failure also signaled a shift in the balance of power in Eastern Europe, consolidating Russia's dominance in the region and diminishing the Hetmanate's autonomy.[138][139]

After the defeat at Poltava, Ivan Skoropadsky led the Hetmanate (1708–1722) during a challenging period of diminishing autonomy. While he sought to navigate the growing pressures from Russia, his efforts were significantly undermined in 1722 when Peter I established the Little Russian Collegium. This administrative body, composed largely of imperial officials, was tasked with supervising the Hetmanate's governance, effectively curtailing Skoropadsky's authority and undermining traditional Cossack institutions. His death in 1722 left the Hetmanate vulnerable to further imperial centralization.[140] Following Skoropadsky's death, Pavlo Polubotok, serving as acting Hetman, attempted to resist Moscow's encroachments. Polubotok appealed to Peter I to honor the Hetmanate's earlier agreements, particularly those guaranteeing autonomy. However, his resistance led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where he died in 1724. Polubotok's fate symbolized the futility of overt resistance during this phase, as the imperial government tightened its grip on the region.[141]

A brief resurgence of autonomy occurred under Danylo Apostol (1727–1734), whose election marked a temporary relaxation of imperial policies following Peter I's death. Apostol negotiated limited autonomy for the Hetmanate, securing greater control over local taxation and governance. He also implemented administrative and judicial reforms aimed at strengthening internal stability. Despite these achievements, Apostol's death led to another period of direct imperial administration under the Governing Council of the Hetman Office, a body dominated by Russian officials. This period (1734–1750) deepened the integration of the Hetmanate into the imperial administrative structure.[142]

In 1750, the Hetmanate was restored under Kyrylo Rozumovsky, a politically savvy leader with close ties to the Russian court. Rozumovsky sought to modernize the Hetmanate by reforming its administration, judiciary, and military while working to strengthen its autonomy. He relocated the Hetmanate's capital to Hlukhiv, transforming it into a political and cultural center. Rozumovsky also initiated ambitious projects, including plans to establish a university, reflecting his vision of the Hetmanate as a semi-autonomous, modernized polity within the Russian Empire. However, his growing influence and calls for greater independence alarmed Catherine the Great, who was determined to centralize power.[143][144]

In 1764, Catherine the Great formally abolished the Hetmanate, transferring its governance to the Little Russian Collegium. This move marked the end of the Hetmanate's semi-autonomous status and its complete incorporation into the administrative structure of the Russian Empire. The abolition not only dismantled the Hetmanate's unique political and military institutions but also signified the culmination of a broader imperial strategy to suppress regional autonomy in favor of centralized governance.[145]

During the 18th century, the Russian Empire transitioned from providing nominal ""protection"" to exerting direct control over central Ukraine, progressively eroding the autonomy of the Cossacks. The Cossack uprisings, which had once been directed against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now shifted focus to the Russian authorities. By the late 18th century, these uprisings had largely subsided, their potency undermined by the overwhelming might of the Russian Empire and deep divisions within the Cossack leadership.[146]

The Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 marked a pivotal moment for the Ukrainian Cossacks and their role within the Russian Empire. The Cossacks had provided crucial support during the war, significantly contributing to Russian victories. The conflict culminated in the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, which granted Russia significant territorial acquisitions along the Black Sea coast, further consolidating its influence in the region. This success reduced the strategic importance of the Zaporozhian Sich, as the borderlands the Cossacks had long defended were now firmly under Russian control. The geopolitical realignment weakened the Cossacks’ traditional role, setting the stage for their eventual demise.[147]

In 1775, Empress Catherine the Great took decisive action to eliminate what she perceived as a potential threat to her centralized rule. The Zaporozhian Sich, with its semi-autonomous status and militarized society, stood as a symbol of independence that clashed with the empire’s drive toward unification. Acting on her orders, General Peter Tekeli led a massive military force to suppress the Sich. On June 15, 1775, Tekeli’s forces, composed of 45,000 troops—including 8 cavalry regiments, 10 infantry regiments, 20 hussar squadrons, 17 pike squadrons, and 13 squadrons of Don Cossacks—overwhelmed the Sich. Defended by a mere 3,000 Cossacks, the Sich fell with little resistance. The destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich marked the end of an era, effectively dismantling one of the last vestiges of Ukrainian self-rule.[148]

The last Kosh Otaman, Petro Kalnyshevsky, was arrested and exiled to the Solovetsky Islands in the far north, where he spent the remainder of his life in harsh conditions, dying in captivity. Following the destruction, a smaller group of Cossacks fled to the lands of the Ottoman Empire, settling beyond the Danube, where they formed the Danubian Sich. Others relocated to the Kuban region in the Russian Empire, where they helped establish the Kuban Cossack Host. However, the majority of the Ukrainian Cossacks were deported to remote parts of the Russian Empire, including Siberia, in a move that sought to break their power and disperse their population. In addition to the loss of Cossack autonomy, the Russian troops seized over 30,000 documents, along with weapons and other valuables, representing the history of Ukraine from the 16th to the 18th centuries. These items were stored in the fortress of St. Elizabeth, which had been the primary military base of the Russian Imperial Army in Ukraine. These historical artifacts remained in St. Elizabeth’s fortress until they were eventually transferred to Kyiv in 1918, providing valuable insights into the rich history of the Ukrainian Cossacks.[149][150][151]

Meanwhile, in right-bank Ukraine, dissatisfaction with Polish rule had been growing for decades. Increased corvée (forced labor) obligations, along with the abuse of power by Polish magnates, nobles, and their Jewish stewards, led to widespread unrest. The peasants, many of whom were Orthodox Christians, resented the imposition of taxes and labor on their lands, as well as the presence of Roman Catholic and Uniate clergy. The resulting discontent gave rise to a series of Haidamak uprisings, in which bands of rebels attacked and looted towns, targeting the estates of nobles, clergy, and Jewish populations. Major uprisings occurred in 1734, 1750, and the largest—known as Koliyivschyna—took place in 1768. This revolt was a culmination of decades of accumulated grievances, sparked by rumors of impending changes in religious and social policies that threatened the Orthodox community. The rebellion saw widespread attacks across towns and estates, resulting in significant loss of life and property. While the Haidamaks initially achieved some successes, the uprising was ultimately brutally suppressed by Polish forces with the assistance of Russian troops.[152]

By the end of the century, Catherine the Great’s policies had reshaped the political landscape of Ukraine. The Cossack's role in defending the borderlands was no longer necessary, as the Russian Empire now controlled the Black Sea and Crimea. In 1783, the Crimean Khanate was formally annexed by Russia, cementing control over the northern Black Sea region. A few years earlier, in 1778, a mass emigration of Christians from Crimea occurred, further altering the demographic balance of the region. Finally, in 1793, following the Second Partition of Poland, right-bank Ukraine was officially incorporated into the Russian Empire. By the end of Catherine’s reign, most of Ukraine had fallen under Russian control, bringing an end to the centuries-old struggle for autonomy and leaving the Ukrainian people under the rule of the imperial power.[153]

Under the reign of Alexander I (1801–1825), the Russian presence in Ukraine was largely limited to the imperial army and its bureaucracy. However, by the reign of Nicholas I (1825–1855), Russia had established a centralized administration in Ukraine. After suppressing the November Uprising of 1830, the tsarist regime implemented Russification policies, particularly on the Right-bank Ukraine. These policies not only suppressed the Ukrainian language but also aimed to weaken local traditions by emphasizing loyalty to the Russian Orthodox Church, which actively promoted Russification in contrast to the Uniate Church's earlier influence in Western Ukraine.[154]

The 1861 emancipation of serfs had a profound effect on Ukraine, as 42% of its population were serfs. By the late 19th century, heavy taxes, rapid population growth, and land shortages led to widespread impoverishment among the peasantry. Many rural Ukrainians began migrating to cities, where industrialization and urban development created new economic opportunities but also fostered a growing sense of class consciousness. The construction of the first railway track in 1866 not only integrated Ukraine’s economy into the Russian imperial system but also facilitated the mobility of workers and goods. Despite their hardships, Ukrainian peasants and workers contributed significantly to the empire’s economy, with the steppe regions producing 20% of the world's wheat and 80% of the empire's sugar.[154]

The Ukrainian national revival began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern Ukrainian literature, spearheaded by Ivan Kotliarevsky. Prominent 19th-century Ukrainian authors included Taras Shevchenko, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, and Lesya Ukrainka in the Russian Empire, and Ivan Franko in Austria-Hungary. The rise of a Ukrainian intelligentsia, increasingly composed of commoners and peasants, challenged the dominance of the traditional nobility and fueled the movement for national rights and social justice. However, fearing the rise of separatism, the Russian government imposed strict limits on Ukrainian language and culture. In 1863, the Valuev Circular banned the use of Ukrainian in religious and educational texts. Further repression came with the Ems Ukaz in 1876, which prohibited Ukrainian-language publications, the import of Ukrainian books from abroad, the use of Ukrainian in theater, and even public readings. Ukrainian schools were also suppressed. These policies prompted many Ukrainian intellectuals, such as Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykhailo Hrushevsky, to flee to Austrian-ruled Western Ukraine.[155] In addition, the development of underground educational organizations, such as the ""Prosvita"" society, played a critical role in preserving Ukrainian culture. Despite the restrictions, Ukrainians within the Russian Empire sometimes succeeded in advancing within the system, often blending loyalty to the tsar with a subtle promotion of their heritage.

The fate of Ukrainians under the Austrian Empire was markedly different. In Austrian-ruled Galicia, Ukrainians found themselves in a delicate position within the broader Russian-Austrian rivalry for influence in Central and Southern Europe. Unlike in the Russian Empire, Galicia’s ruling elite were primarily of Austrian or Polish descent, while the Ruthenian population remained predominantly peasant. During the 19th century, Russophilia was initially common among Galicia’s Slavic population. However, the influx of Ukrainian intellectuals fleeing Russian repression, combined with Austrian intervention, gradually replaced Russophilia with a growing Ukrainophilia. This sentiment spread back into Russian-ruled Ukraine, fueling the national revival.[154]

The 2.4 million Ukrainians under Habsburg rule lived primarily in Eastern Galicia, with 95% of them being peasants. The region remained one of the poorest in Europe, with persistent land shortages and limited industrialization. Nevertheless, the Greek Catholic Church in Galicia became a key institution in preserving Ukrainian culture and fostering national identity. The first Ukrainian-language newspaper, Zoria Halytska, launched in 1848, symbolized the growing national awakening. Many Ukrainians from Galicia and other Austrian territories also emigrated to North America and South America during this period, seeking economic opportunities and escaping poverty.[156]

The late 19th century witnessed a slow but steady growth of Ukrainian urban populations and the beginnings of a political awakening. Ukrainians in Galicia formed the Supreme Ruthenian Council and began advocating for autonomy and reforms, such as land redistribution. In Russian Ukraine, underground networks spread literature, education, and national ideas among the peasantry, contributing to the resilience of Ukrainian identity under challenging conditions.

World War I and the wave of revolutions that swept across Europe—including the October Revolution in Russia—shattered empires such as the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires, leaving Ukraine caught in the midst of geopolitical upheaval. Between 1917 and 1919, several Ukrainian republics declared independence, marking the emergence of a complex array of states and territories seeking sovereignty. Among these were the Ukrainian People's Republic, the Ukrainian State, the West Ukrainian People's Republic, the Makhnovshchina, the Kholodny Yar Republic, and the Kuban People's Republic. Concurrently, a number of Bolshevik revolutionary committees, or revkoms, sought to establish Soviet power, leading to the formation of various Soviet-aligned entities, including the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets, the Odessa Soviet Republic, the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic, the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Each of these republics and regimes represented different visions for Ukraine's future, reflecting the era's ideological and territorial conflicts that would profoundly impact the region.

The Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) was officially proclaimed on November 20, 1917, amidst the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the disintegration of the Russian Empire. Initially, the Ukrainian Central Council (Rada), comprising influential Ukrainian political figures, pursued autonomy within a federated Russia. However, as the political situation in Russia grew increasingly unstable, the UPR took a decisive step by declaring full independence on January 22, 1918.[157]

From its inception, the fledgling UPR faced significant challenges. Internally, political divisions among various factions, including socialists, nationalists, and federalists, complicated governance and decision-making. Economically, the nascent republic struggled with the transition from imperial control to an independent administration, resulting in shortages, inflation, and a weakened infrastructure. Externally, the UPR faced threats from multiple sides, primarily from the Bolsheviks, who regarded Ukraine as essential to their revolutionary agenda. As a result, they launched a series of military campaigns to assert control over Ukrainian territories, triggering prolonged and intense conflicts with UPR forces.[158]

As the Bolsheviks sought to expand their influence across the former territories of the Russian Empire, Ukraine became a significant battleground. In December 1917, amidst the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the collapse of imperial power, the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets was proclaimed. This was a direct challenge to the Ukrainian People's Republic, which had declared its independence from the Russian Empire earlier that year. The UPR, led by nationalists and democrats, sought to build an independent Ukrainian state. In contrast, the Bolshevik-backed People's Republic of Soviets aimed to bring Ukraine under Soviet control and align it with the goals of the Russian Bolsheviks.[159]

In March 1918, this newly established republic merged with two other short-lived Soviet republics in the region: the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic and the Odessa Soviet Republic. These republics were formed by local Bolshevik groups seeking to establish Soviet power across key industrial and strategic regions of Ukraine. The result of this merger was the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, a state that was aligned with Soviet Russia and part of the larger efforts of the Bolsheviks to secure control over Ukraine during the chaotic period of civil war and foreign intervention. This period was marked by fierce conflicts between various Ukrainian factions, including the Ukrainian People's Republic, anarchists, and foreign powers, alongside the advancing Bolshevik forces, contributing to the overall instability of the region. When the Bolshevik troops retreated from the territory, on April 18, 1918, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was officially dissolved.[160][161]

Amid growing unrest, a coup d'état led by General Pavlo Skoropadskyi on April 29, 1918, dismantled the UPR and established the Ukrainian State, also known as the Hetmanate. Skoropadskyi, a former officer in the Russian Imperial Army, assumed the title of Hetman of all Ukraine, aiming to create a strong, centralized state with close ties to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. His vision for the Hetmanate included restoring order, promoting economic development, and implementing agrarian reforms to stabilize the economy and society.[162]

While the Hetmanate initially brought some stability, Skoropadskyi's alignment with the Central Powers and his authoritarian policies alienated many Ukrainians. Nationalists, socialists, and peasant groups grew increasingly discontented, perceiving his regime as prioritizing foreign interests over Ukrainian sovereignty. Additionally, Skoropadskyi's agricultural reforms, which often favored large landowners and reinstated some pre-revolutionary land policies, furthered resentment among the rural populace.[163]

As the Central Powers began to crumble in late 1918 with their defeat in World War I, opposition to Skoropadskyi's rule surged. In November 1918, a coalition of anti-Hetmanate forces known as The Directorate, led by Symon Petliura, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, and other prominent Ukrainian leaders, initiated a successful uprising against Skoropadskyi’s government. By December 1918, Skoropadskyi was forced to abdicate, dissolving the Ukrainian State and restoring the Ukrainian People's Republic.[164]

Simultaneously, a separate Ukrainian state was established in the western part of the country. The West Ukrainian People's Republic (WUPR) was proclaimed on October 19, 1918, following the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This new state centered around Eastern Galicia, including the key city of Lviv, Transcarpathia and extended into parts of Bukovina, areas with substantial Ukrainian populations. The WUPR government, led by Yevhen Petrushevych, aspired to build an independent Ukrainian state in Western Ukraine, distinct from both Polish and Russian influences.[165][166]

The WUPR quickly developed its administrative structures, forming the Ukrainian Galician Army to defend its territories and introducing social and economic reforms to stabilize the new state. However, the WUPR’s claim over Eastern Galicia sparked immediate conflict with the re-established Polish state, which also sought control over the region. This territorial dispute erupted into the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918-1919), beginning with fierce fighting in Lviv, where Polish paramilitary forces resisted Ukrainian authority.[167]

Although Ukrainian forces initially gained some ground, the Polish Army, bolstered by material support from the Entente Powers, soon regained momentum. By mid-1919, the Polish Army launched a major offensive, pushing back the Ukrainian Galician Army and regaining control over contested areas. Facing overwhelming opposition, WUPR forces retreated into Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) territory by July 1919, marking the end of the WUPR as an independent state.[168]

In an effort to consolidate their positions during a tumultuous period, UPR and WUPR formally united on January 22, 1919, through the signing of the Unification Act (Act Zluky). This historic declaration symbolized the unification of the two republics into a single Ukrainian state. Despite its significance as a milestone for Ukrainian national aspirations, the unification remained largely symbolic in practice. The lack of effective integration between the UPR and WUPR resulted in minimal military coordination or mutual support. Both entities were preoccupied with their respective military challenges: the UPR was engaged in a desperate struggle against advancing Bolshevik forces, while the WUPR was embroiled in a conflict with Polish troops over territorial claims in Eastern Galicia.[15]

The Makhnovshchina, which existed from 1918 to 1921, was a revolutionary anarchist movement in southern Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno. It emerged during the chaos of the Russian Civil War. The Makhnovists aimed to establish a stateless, self-managed society based on anarchist principles, where peasants and workers controlled the land and factories. Makhno's forces fought against various powers, including the Bolsheviks, the White Army, and foreign invaders. Despite initial successes, the movement was eventually crushed by the Bolsheviks.[169]

The Kholodny Yar Republic, which existed from 1919 to 1922, was a small Ukrainian insurgent state located in the Chyhyryn region. It was formed by local resistance fighters and peasants who opposed both the Bolshevik Red Army and White Army forces during the Russian Civil War. Inspired by Ukrainian independence and nationalist ideals, the republic remained independent for a few years but was eventually overwhelmed by Bolshevik forces.[170][171]

In May 1919, in central Ukraine began the Hryhoriv Uprising, largest anti-soviet Uprising in Ukraine, which was brutally suppressed by regular troops.[172]

The Kuban People's Republic, which existed from 1918 to 1920, was a short-lived state established by Cossacks in the Kuban region, near the Black Sea. In the wake of the Russian Empire's collapse during the revolution, the Kuban Cossacks declared independence and formed the Kuban Rada to govern. Their goal was to preserve their cultural identity and retain control over their land amid the Russian Civil War. The republic allied with the White Army against the Bolsheviks and sought to unite with the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) due to shared Cossack heritage and mutual strategic interests. However, these negotiations never culminated in a formal union, as the republic, isolated at the time, fell to the advancing Bolshevik Red Army in 1920, ending its brief independence.[173][174][175]

After being driven out of Kyiv by Bolshevik forces in early 1919, the UPR government, led by Symon Petliura, continued to resist Bolshevik advances and Polish encroachment. By 1920, facing insurmountable odds and a deteriorating military position, Petliura sought an alliance with Poland. In April 1920, the Treaty of Warsaw was signed, under which the UPR agreed to recognize Polish control over Western Ukraine in exchange for Polish military support against the Bolsheviks.[176]

The joint Polish-Ukrainian campaign initially achieved some success, including the temporary recapture of Kyiv in May 1920. However, the Bolshevik counter-offensive soon pushed back the allied forces. The situation for the UPR became even more precarious when Poland sought a peace agreement with Soviet Russia, culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Riga in March 1921. The treaty effectively partitioned Ukraine, leaving most of its territory under Soviet control and the western parts under Polish administration.[177]

With the signing of the Treaty of Riga, the UPR government went into exile, primarily in Poland and other European countries. Ukrainian leaders continued their efforts to advocate for Ukrainian independence in the international arena, but without a territorial base or significant military forces, their influence was limited. Symon Petliura, a key figure in the UPR, continued his political activities in exile until his assassination in Paris in 1926.[178]

As both the UPR and WUPR faced defeat, the Bolshevik forces consolidated their control over Ukraine. On December 30, 1919, the Bolsheviks proclaimed the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (Ukrainian SSR), positioning it as a satellite of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The new Soviet government aimed to establish complete Soviet authority over all Ukrainian territories, incorporating Ukraine into the broader framework of Soviet expansion.[16]

The creation of the Ukrainian SSR marked the beginning of Soviet rule in Ukraine. Over the next two years, the Red Army systematically subdued remaining Ukrainian forces, nationalist resistance movements, and other anti-Bolshevik factions. By 1921, Bolshevik forces had largely crushed organized resistance, paving the way for the integration of the Ukrainian SSR as one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union in 1922.[181]

In the 1920s, the Soviet government implemented a policy of ""Ukrainization"" as part of its broader strategy to strengthen support for the Soviet regime in non-Russian republics. This policy encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language in education, government, and media. Ukrainian culture and history were promoted to win over the local population and intellectual elite. Ukrainization allowed a degree of cultural revival after years of Russian dominance in Ukraine. Ukrainian literature, theater, and arts experienced significant growth, and schools began teaching in the Ukrainian language. However, this policy was carefully controlled by the Communist Party, ensuring that cultural development aligned with Soviet ideology.[182]

Following the devastation of war and revolution, the Soviet government introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) to stabilize the economy. It represented a temporary retreat from pure socialist policies, allowing some elements of private enterprise and market mechanisms to function alongside state-controlled industries. The NEP had a mixed impact on Ukraine. On one hand, it allowed limited economic recovery, especially in agriculture and small-scale industry. Peasants were permitted to sell surplus products on the market, and small businesses could operate under certain conditions. On the other hand, large-scale industries remained under state control, and the heavy industrial sector, which Ukraine relied on, remained inefficient and slow to recover. While the NEP offered some relief to peasants, many remained suspicious of Soviet power, particularly after the harsh grain requisition policies during the civil war. Tensions between the peasantry and the Soviet regime continued to simmer.[183]

During this period, the Communist Party tightened its control over Ukraine. The Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) became a key instrument in enforcing Soviet policies and maintaining order. Political power was highly centralized, with decisions made in Moscow dictating policy in Ukraine. Despite the relative cultural freedom of Ukrainization, any political opposition to the Soviet regime was harshly repressed. Former nationalists, intellectuals, and opponents of Soviet power were marginalized, and any movement toward true Ukrainian autonomy was quickly suppressed.[184]

In the early Soviet years, there was a strong emphasis on rebuilding Ukraine's war-ravaged economy. Ukraine was a critical industrial center, especially in coal, steel, and machinery production. While some infrastructure was rebuilt, economic challenges remained due to the inefficiency of state control and the lingering effects of war. Ukraine, being an agriculturally rich region, faced difficulties as the peasants were subjected to state control over grain production. Despite the NEP, rural areas continued to suffer from poverty, which would later fuel resistance to Soviet policies.[185]

By the late 1920s, the NEP was being phased out as the Soviet Union shifted toward a more centralized, state-controlled economy under Stalin. The focus turned to rapid industrialization and forced collectivization, laying the groundwork for the dramatic and tragic events of the 1930s, including the Holodomor. Although Ukrainization had seen relative success during the 1920s, Stalin’s regime began reversing the policy by the decade’s end, replacing it with a drive toward Russian centralization. The following years would witness a harsh crackdown on Ukrainian nationalism and culture as part of Stalin’s broader effort to consolidate control over the Soviet republics.[183]

In 1929, Joseph Stalin launched a campaign of forced collectivization across the Soviet Union, including Ukraine. The policy aimed to consolidate individual peasant farms into large, state-controlled collective farms (kolkhozes) to increase agricultural productivity and secure grain supplies for rapid industrialization. Ukrainian peasants, particularly wealthier ones known as ""kulaks"", resisted collectivization. The Soviet regime responded with brutal force, seizing land, livestock, and grain, and deporting or executing those who resisted. Collectivization led to widespread chaos in rural areas. Agricultural output plummeted due to poor planning, lack of incentives, and resistance from the peasantry. The disruption of traditional farming practices and the state's requisition of grain exacerbated food shortages.[186]

In 1932-33, Holodomor, derived from the Ukrainian words for ""hunger"" (holod) and ""extermination"" (moryty), was a man-made famine that resulted from the Soviet government's grain requisition policies and punitive measures against those who resisted collectivization. Several millions of Ukrainians died from starvation during the Holodomor. Entire villages were decimated, and the event remains one of the most tragic episodes in Ukrainian history. The Soviet government denied the famine's existence and continued exporting grain during the crisis. The Holodomor not only devastated the rural population but also weakened Ukrainian national identity and culture. It served as a stark warning against any resistance to Soviet authority.[16]: §§ 8.1.3 [187][188]

Stalin's economic strategy included a series of Five-Year Plans aimed at rapidly industrializing the Soviet Union. Ukraine, with its rich natural resources and strategic location, was a key focus of these plans. Ukraine became a major center for heavy industry, particularly in coal mining, steel production, and machine building. Cities like Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk (now Dnipro), and Stalino (now Donetsk) were transformed into industrial hubs. The rapid growth of industry led to significant urbanization. Millions of Ukrainians moved from rural areas to cities in search of work, fundamentally altering the demographic and social landscape.[189]

Throughout the 1930s, Stalin's regime became increasingly marked by paranoia and a relentless drive to eradicate any perceived threats to his authority. This climate of suspicion fueled widespread political repression across the Soviet Union, profoundly impacting every layer of society in Ukraine. The purges specifically targeted Ukrainian intellectuals, artists, political leaders, and ordinary citizens suspected of harboring nationalist sympathies or potential dissenting views. Stalin’s objective was clear: to eliminate any possible source of opposition to Soviet rule, no matter how tenuous or imagined.[190]

The Great Purge, reaching its zenith between 1936 and 1938, devastated Ukraine. During this period, tens of thousands were arrested, tortured, and executed, or sent to forced labor camps (the Gulag) in remote Soviet regions. The Ukrainian intelligentsia, initially supported during the Soviet policy of Ukrainization in the 1920s, became a particular target as they were increasingly viewed as a threat to Soviet ideological conformity. In a systematic crackdown, the NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, dismantled the Ukrainian cultural and intellectual community. Most members of this intelligentsia were either imprisoned, executed, or driven to despair and suicide. One notable site, the Slovo Building in Kharkiv, where many prominent Ukrainian intellectuals resided, became infamous as a place where residents were closely surveilled, then rounded up in these purges.[191][192]

The terror also took a horrific toll on Kyiv, which became the capital of the Ukrainian SSR in 1934, replacing Kharkiv. Tens of thousands of Kyiv’s citizens were abducted by Soviet security forces, tortured, and summarily executed on fabricated charges. Victims were accused of treason, espionage, or nationalist activities without evidence and sentenced to death in sham trials. Their bodies were secretly buried in Bykivnia, a wooded area near Kyiv, which later became one of the largest mass grave sites in Ukraine. After Ukraine’s independence and the declassification of KGB archives, thousands of graves were discovered in Bykivnia, leading to the establishment of the Bykivnia Graves Memorial Complex. Soviet authorities had long denied the truth, claiming instead that Nazi atrocities had caused the mass burials.[193][194]

These purges were marked by infamous show trials, where prominent figures were coerced, often through brutal interrogation, into confessing to invented charges of anti-Soviet activity. The loss of Ukraine's educated and skilled citizens stifled intellectual, cultural, and social progress for decades, creating a legacy of fear that has hampered Ukraine's development and left a scar that is remembered in Ukraine to this day.[195]

In October 1938, following the Munich Agreement, Carpatho-Ukraine, also known as Subcarpathian Ruthenia, gained autonomy within Czechoslovakia. This allowed the formation of a local government led by Avhustyn Voloshyn. However, this period of autonomy was brief.[196]

In March 1939, as Czechoslovakia disintegrated under pressure from Nazi Germany, Carpathian Ukraine declared independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine. The government envisioned this small, mountainous region as the nucleus of a future independent Ukrainian state. This independence was short-lived. Within days, Hungarian forces, supported by Nazi Germany, invaded and occupied the region. The occupation was brutal, and many Ukrainian leaders were arrested or executed. Carpathian Ukraine remained under Hungarian control.[197]

On 1 September 1939, World War II began with Nazi Germany’s invasion of western Poland. Sixteen days later, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The eastern part of Poland, which included Western Ukraine (Galicia and Volhynia), was annexed into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. As Soviet forces occupied these territories, they quickly implemented Sovietization policies, repressing nationalist movements and religious institutions, which fueled local resentment.[198]

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany and its allies launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union. Ukraine became one of the main battlegrounds during the conflict, as Nazi forces occupied large parts of the country, including major cities such as Kyiv, Odesa, and Lviv. The German occupation, while initially seen by some as a potential liberation from the oppressive Soviet regime, quickly turned brutal. Nazi ideology viewed Ukraine as a critical part of its plan for Lebensraum (living space) and exploitation of resources.[199][200][201][202]

Around 4.5 to 6 million Ukrainians fought in the Soviet Red Army against Nazi Germany, contributing significantly to the eventual Soviet victory. At the same time, Ukraine became a center of partisan resistance. Some Ukrainians collaborated with the Germans, hoping to secure independence, while others joined the resistance movement. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), formed by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), fought for an independent Ukraine, engaging in conflict with both the Nazis and the Soviet forces. This dual struggle was motivated by a desire to free Ukraine from foreign domination, but the complexity of alliances and enmities made this a multi-sided war.[203]

Meanwhile, some factions within the Ukrainian nationalist movement, such as the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDA), sought autonomy within a pro-Polish framework before the war. However, Polish policies of forced assimilation marginalized these efforts, leading to growing tensions between Poles and Ukrainians. During the German occupation, these tensions escalated into violent ethnic conflicts in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, known as the Volhynia genocide. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and Polish underground forces, including the Armia Krajowa, engaged in a simultaneous campaign of mutual violence during 1943–1944. The UPA targeted Polish civilians in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, resulting in the deaths of up to 100,000 Poles, while Polish forces carried out attacks on Ukrainian civilians, killing up to 25,000 Ukrainians. These events, driven by competing nationalist ambitions, caused immense suffering on both sides and remain a deeply painful chapter in Ukrainian-Polish history.[204]

The Nazi occupation of Ukraine was marked by extreme brutality, especially towards Jews. Around 1.5 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust in Ukraine, with atrocities such as the Babi Yar massacre, where tens of thousands of Jews were executed near Kyiv. The occupation also saw widespread repression of other groups, including Roma, communists, and Ukrainian nationalists.[205]

By 1943, following the Battle of Stalingrad, the tide of the war began to turn in favor of the Soviet Union. Soviet forces began to push the Germans out of Ukraine, and by 1944, the entire country was back under Soviet control. However, Soviet ""liberation"" did not bring freedom for many Ukrainians. The Soviet government imposed harsh reprisals against those suspected of collaboration with the Nazis or support for Ukrainian independence. The NKVD (Soviet secret police) conducted mass arrests, deportations, and executions. Small groups of UPA partisans continued their armed resistance against the Soviet regime well into the late 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in Western Ukraine, though the Soviet authorities eventually crushed this insurgency.[206]

Carpathian Ukraine, during the Hungarian occupation, faced significant repression, particularly against its Jewish and Ukrainian populations. Thousands of Jews from the region were deported to Nazi concentration camps, and many Ukrainian nationalists were imprisoned or killed. In 1944, the Soviet Red Army ""liberated"" Carpathian Ukraine from Hungarian and German forces.[207]

In addition to the annexation of Galicia and Volhynia, several other territories were incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and subsequent wartime events. These included Northern Bukovina, Carpathian Ukraine (Transcarpathia), and parts of Northern and South Bessarabia, regions with a predominantly Ukrainian population.[208][209]

After World War II, amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of international law in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of the founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR. This was part of a deal with the United States to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly, which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 1948–1949 and 1984–1985.[210][211]

However, this period was also marked by severe repression and social upheaval. The famine of 1946-1947 devastated large parts of Ukraine, as the Soviet government requisitioned the entirety of the grain harvest, exacerbating food shortages. Western Ukraine, however, was less affected by the famine, largely due to the resistance efforts of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA). In response, the Soviet regime launched Operation ""West"" in 1947, forcibly deporting over 77,000 individuals—men, women, and children—from Western Ukraine to Siberia. These deportees later played a critical role in organizing uprisings within the Soviet Gulag system, including the notable Norilsk Uprising, which hastened the decline of the forced labor camp network.[212][213][214]

After Stalin's death in 1953 and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev to power, a significant number of political prisoners were released from the Gulag, including many Ukrainian nationalists and intellectuals. However, those deemed a threat to Soviet authority often remained under close surveillance. While some victims of Stalinist purges were formally rehabilitated, this process was selective and incomplete, with many individuals still excluded from full reintegration into society.[215]

Khrushchev, focusing on agricultural development, emphasized the importance of Ukraine’s fertile soil in Soviet food production. This was particularly significant in the context of the Virgin Lands Campaign, which saw resources and personnel diverted to develop agricultural lands in Kazakhstan and Siberia. While the campaign had long-term effects on the Ukrainian agricultural sector, Ukrainian collective farms remained inefficient, plagued by bureaucratic mismanagement that hampered the potential benefits of these reforms. During this period, industrial growth continued, with particular emphasis on heavy industries like steel production and mining. However, outdated infrastructure and poor planning often undermined progress, and economic inefficiency persisted throughout the country.[216]

The Khrushchev Thaw, a period of relative cultural liberalization, also allowed for a limited expression of Ukrainian identity, especially through literature, the arts, and historical studies. Prominent Ukrainian writers such as Oles Honchar and Lina Kostenko emerged, reflecting themes of national identity and social change. Their work offered subtle resistance to Soviet ideologies, though they had to navigate a highly censored environment. Industrialization also sparked rapid urbanization, with many Ukrainians moving to cities for factory and mining jobs. This period saw a rise in literacy rates and access to education, contributing to the development of a more technically skilled population. However, the curricula remained ideologically driven, prioritizing loyalty to the Communist Party over independent thought or national identity.[217]

In 1954, the Crimean Peninsula was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) to the Ukrainian SSR. The transfer was largely administrative, as both the RSFSR and the Ukrainian SSR were part of the Soviet Union, and it was part of Khrushchev's broader strategy, rather than a gesture of genuine autonomy for Ukraine.[218] Meanwhile, Ukrainian nationalists, including remnants of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), continued to face persecution. While the UPA’s armed resistance had been largely crushed by the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments remained a clandestine force, particularly among intellectuals and rural populations. Those who strayed too far from Soviet ideology faced censorship, harassment, and sometimes imprisonment. Despite the brief cultural revival and improvements in living standards, the era was marked by continued economic inefficiency and political repression. The limited freedoms allowed under Khrushchev's rule fostered a new generation of Ukrainian intellectuals who began to explore national identity in ways that would later fuel the dissident movement. However, despite these small steps toward cultural and intellectual freedom, Ukraine remained firmly under Soviet control, with little political autonomy or room for genuine national development.[219][220]

The transfer of power from Nikita Khrushchev to Leonid Brezhnev in 1964 was a result of a coup orchestrated by the Communist Party leadership. Khrushchev's policies, such as de-Stalinization and economic reforms, had created dissatisfaction among party elites due to their perceived instability and inefficiency. In October 1964, during a Politburo meeting, Khrushchev was accused of policy failures and forced to resign. Leonid Brezhnev, who had gained the trust of party conservatives, replaced Khrushchev as General Secretary. Brezhnev’s leadership marked a return to collective decision-making, stability, and more conservative policies, emphasizing continuity and avoiding the bold reforms associated with Khrushchev.[221]

Under Brezhnev, often associated with the ""stagnation"" period, Ukraine faced significant challenges. Centralized control from Moscow left Ukrainian Communist Party leaders, such as Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, as mere executors of Kremlin policies. Russification policies intensified, sidelining the Ukrainian language and culture in favor of Soviet Russian dominance. Ukrainian literature, art, and history were heavily censored, with works reflecting national identity banned or rewritten. Political repression was severe. The KGB targeted dissidents, intellectuals, and cultural figures advocating for Ukrainian autonomy or identity. Figures like Vasyl Stus, Ivan Dziuba, and Viacheslav Chornovil faced harassment, imprisonment, or exile. Despite repression, underground movements persisted, using samizdat to circulate banned works and raise awareness of Soviet human rights violations.[221][222]

Economically, Ukraine remained an industrial powerhouse, producing steel, coal, and machinery, and serving as the Soviet Union's ""breadbasket"". However, inefficient planning, outdated infrastructure, and environmental degradation plagued the economy. Poor agricultural yields and bureaucratic mismanagement led to food shortages. Urbanization grew, but housing shortages and inadequate services highlighted the stagnation. Environmental issues worsened, particularly in industrial regions like Donbas, where pollution severely impacted public health. Rural areas were neglected, fueling urban migration. Despite Ukraine’s contributions to the Soviet space program and industrial output, minimal modernization occurred.[221]

The suppression of Ukrainian identity and the struggles of dissidents sowed seeds of resistance. Activists like Vasyl Stus and the Ukrainian Helsinki Group exposed Soviet human rights abuses, though they faced harsh punishments. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Ukraine became a focal point for dissident activity within the USSR. A disproportionately high number of Ukrainian intellectuals, activists, and cultural figures were imprisoned, exiled, or subjected to punitive psychiatry for opposing the regime. These movements not only highlighted systemic oppression in the Soviet Union, but also laid the foundation for a national awakening that ultimately fueled Ukraine's quest for independence.[223]

After the death of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982, the Soviet Union experienced a period of short-lived leadership under Yuri Andropov (1982–1984) and Konstantin Chernenko (1984–1985), before Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power in 1985. Gorbachev's introduction of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) marked a turning point, fostering an atmosphere of reform and amplifying public dissatisfaction with Soviet governance. Glasnost opened the door for greater freedom of expression, allowing Ukrainian intellectuals, activists, and dissidents to publicly address long-suppressed issues such as Russification, environmental degradation, and historical atrocities like the Holodomor. During this time, organizations like the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, and movements like Rukh (the People’s Movement of Ukraine, established in 1989) emerged as key advocates for greater autonomy, cultural revival, and ultimately, independence. As a major industrial and agricultural hub within the USSR, Ukraine bore the brunt of the broader Soviet economic stagnation. Inefficient central planning, a lack of innovation, and overexploitation of resources resulted in widespread economic inefficiencies and severe environmental damage.[224][225]

On 26 April 1986, the Ukrainian town of Pripyat became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history when Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded. This released a significant amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere, which was carried across Europe by wind currents. The resulting radioactive fallout contaminated vast areas of northern Ukraine and neighboring Belarus. The immediate aftermath of the explosion was devastating. Two plant workers died on the night of the accident, and in the weeks that followed, 28 emergency workers succumbed to acute radiation sickness. The disaster forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people from Pripyat and surrounding areas, leaving behind ghost towns and a contaminated Chernobyl exclusion zone that remains uninhabitable to this day. This tragedy had profound environmental, health, and political consequences. The Chernobyl disaster galvanized local independence movements, such as Rukh, which gained significant momentum in the late 1980s and contributed to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union.[226]

The late 1980s witnessed a cultural awakening in Ukraine, characterized by a renewed interest in the Ukrainian language, traditions, and history. Efforts to revive Ukrainian cultural identity challenged decades of Soviet policies aimed at suppressing it. The reestablishment of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and movements advocating for an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church underscored growing dissatisfaction with Soviet atheism and fueled nationalist sentiment. These developments signaled a rising tide of Ukrainian self-awareness and a determination to reclaim national identity and sovereignty.[227][228]

By 1990, calls for Ukrainian sovereignty reached a fever pitch, fueled by decades of cultural suppression, economic exploitation, and a growing national consciousness among Ukrainians. On 21 January 1990, one of the most iconic demonstrations of unity and determination occurred when over 300,000 Ukrainians formed the ""human chain"" stretching from Kyiv to Lviv. This symbolic act, known as the ""Chain of Unity"", marked the anniversary of the Unification Act of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the West Ukrainian People's Republic in 1919. It highlighted the nation's steadfast commitment to reclaiming its independence, emphasizing the unity between eastern and western Ukraine.[229]

These events were part of the broader 1989–1991 Ukrainian revolution—a period of democratic transformation, national awakening, and growing resistance to Soviet authoritarianism. The revolution was driven by civil society, student movements, intellectuals, and reform-minded politicians who pushed for sovereignty, environmental justice, human rights, and national self-determination. One of the most influential forces during this period was Rukh (the People's Movement of Ukraine). Initially established as a cultural and civic organization, Rukh quickly evolved into a powerful political force advocating for Ukrainian independence. It played a central role in organizing protests, defending national symbols, and supporting legislative reforms, such as the recognition of Ukrainian as the official state language.[230]

A key figure in this movement was Viacheslav Chornovil—a former Soviet dissident, journalist, and passionate advocate for national rights. Chornovil emerged as one of the most respected voices of the revolution. His moral authority, experience of imprisonment for political beliefs, and powerful rhetoric inspired thousands. As a leader within Rukh, he helped to unify disparate opposition groups and articulate a clear vision for an independent Ukraine based on democratic principles and historical justice.[231]

One of the defining moments of this period came in October 1990, during the student-led protest in Kyiv known as the Revolution on Granite. Hundreds of students went on hunger strike in the central square, demanding the resignation of the Soviet-aligned government, the rejection of a new union treaty, and the mandatory military service of Ukrainians only within Ukraine. Their peaceful protest captured the public’s imagination and ended in success—the resignation of Prime Minister Vitaly Masol and the partial acceptance of their demands. It was a landmark event that showed the strength of civic resistance and the determination of Ukraine’s younger generation to chart a new political course.[232][233][234]

On 16 July 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine—a foundational legal document asserting the supremacy of Ukrainian laws over Soviet legislation, the right to form its own military, conduct international relations, and establish an independent economy. Though not a declaration of full independence, it was a decisive step that laid the groundwork for the future Ukrainian state and provided a legal framework for distancing from the USSR.[235]

In March 1991, a referendum on preserving the Soviet Union was held, and in Ukraine, the majority of voters approved the new Union Treaty, supporting the idea of joining the Soviet Union based on Ukraine's Declaration of State Sovereignty. Voters were specifically asked, ""Do you agree that Ukraine should be part of a Union of Soviet sovereign states on the basis of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine?"" The proposal was approved by 81.7% of voters.[236]

However, a few months later, events occurred that radically changed the situation. In August 1991, the so-called August Coup took place in Moscow, an attempt by conservative communists to seize power and regain tight control within the USSR. The coup failed, but it seriously undermined trust in the central government in the USSR, provoking a wave of declarations of independence among the republics.[237]

On August 24, 1991, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union, a decisive step taken in the wake of the failed August Coup.[238] This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where 90.32% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 54.19% in Crimea).[239] That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history. Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election, becoming first President of Ukraine. During his tenure, Kravchuk worked to maintain stability, distance Ukraine from Moscow’s influence, and manage internal political challenges.[240]

The dissolution of the USSR was formalized in the Białowieża Forest in Belarus, where the leaders of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—Leonid Kravchuk, Stanislav Shushkevich, and Boris Yeltsin—signed the Belovezha Accords on 8 December 1991. These accords declared the Soviet Union defunct and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a loose association of former Soviet republics. By 26 December 1991, the USSR officially ceased to exist, and Ukraine's independence gained de jure recognition from the international community.[241]

After declaring independence, Ukraine began a complex post-Soviet transition, shaping its identity as a new independent nation. From 1991 to 1996, Ukraine experienced significant political, economic, and social transformations aimed at establishing itself as a sovereign state on the global stage.[242]

In the early years of independence, the Verkhovna Rada played a key role in establishing the country’s legal and political framework. As Ukraine’s legislative body, the Rada was responsible for drafting and passing laws to build the foundation of Ukraine’s political and economic structures. However, it faced ideological divides as members debated Ukraine’s path—whether to orient toward Western integration or maintain stronger ties with Russian Federation. These debates mirrored broader societal divides and significantly influenced legislative reform.[243]

To solidify its national identity, Ukraine adopted state symbols that resonated with historical and cultural significance. The Parliament selected the blue-and-yellow flag and the tryzub (trident) as national emblems, which became powerful representations of Ukrainian sovereignty and unity.[244][245]

A significant historical moment of this period was the transfer of powers from the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, Mykola Plaviuk, to the newly elected President of independent Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, during the solemn session of the Verkhovna Rada on August 22, 1992 in Kyiv. This transfer, while largely symbolic, marked a continuity of the Ukrainian struggle for independence, linking the efforts of past leaders to those of the new government. This act represented the culmination of over 70 years of Ukrainian national aspirations and signaled a deepening commitment to the state’s sovereignty and historical continuity.[246][247] In his declaration, Plaviuk proclaimed that the current Ukrainian state is the lawful successor to the Ukrainian People's Republic and a continuation of its authority and state traditions.[248][246][a]

The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, signed on December 5, 1994, by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, was a critical agreement in post-Soviet geopolitics. It formalized the process by which Ukraine surrendered the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, inherited after the Soviet Union's collapse, which included approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads. Although these weapons were stationed on Ukrainian territory, they were operationally controlled by Moscow, and Ukraine’s possession of such an arsenal posed significant concerns for global non-proliferation efforts. In return for surrendering the weapons, the signatory powers provided assurances of Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence. The memorandum guaranteed that no force or threats of force would be used against Ukraine, and no economic or political pressure would be employed to undermine its status. It also affirmed that the United Nations Security Council would intervene in case of aggression against Ukraine. However, the assurances were political commitments, not legally binding guarantees, which made their enforcement dependent on the goodwill of the signatories.[250][251]

The transition to a market economy was compounded by inflation and political instability. The absence of immediate reforms led to widespread frustration, culminating in a snap presidential election in 1994, where Leonid Kravchuk was succeeded by Leonid Kuchma, an engineer and former Soviet official. Kuchma’s presidency aimed at modernizing Ukraine’s economy and fostering a balanced relationship with both Russia and Western Europe, a delicate approach to preserving Ukraine’s independence amid complex geopolitical pressures.[252]

Trying to stabilize the economy, back in 1992, Ukraine introduced a temporary currency, the Ukrainian karbovanets. This currency was intended to serve as a stopgap measure until a more permanent solution could be implemented. The karbovanets quickly devalued, contributing to growing economic instability.[253] In 1996, Ukraine introduced the Hryvnia as the national currency, marking a significant milestone in the country’s economic transition and further solidifying its independence.[254][255] It is named after a measure of weight used in Kievan Rus'.[256]

Despite disputes in the Verkhovna Rada, which at the time struggled to reach consensus on reform initiatives and reconcile the interests of pro-Western and pro-Russian factions, Ukraine took a decisive step in defining its legal structure by adopting the Constitution of Ukraine on June 28, 1996. This document established Ukraine as a democratic, law-based state with a presidential-parliamentary system, clearly delineating the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Drafted with input from various political factions and scholars, the Constitution enshrined Ukraine’s commitment to legal governance and human rights, becoming a cornerstone for Ukraine’s development as an independent nation.[257]

At the end of its transition, Ukraine created the main components of its independence. With its own currency, Constitution, national symbols, and a growing sense of national identity, Ukraine began to chart its course as a sovereign state. Despite the fact that the post-Soviet transition period caused numerous economic and political challenges, this formative period played an important role in shaping the direction and identity of modern Ukraine.

The third presidential election in Ukraine took place in 1999, resulting in a victory for Leonid Kuchma, who defeated Petro Symonenko in the run-off. This secured Kuchma a second consecutive term. However, his second term was plagued by widespread controversies, including allegations of authoritarianism, pervasive corruption scandals, curtailment of media freedoms, and large-scale public protests that challenged his leadership and legitimacy.[258]

One of the darkest episodes of Kuchma’s presidency was the ""Cassette Scandal"", which erupted after recordings allegedly made by his former bodyguard, Mykola Melnychenko, were leaked. These recordings implicated Kuchma in severe abuses of power, including involvement in the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, as well as corruption and electoral manipulations. The scandal provoked massive public outrage, culminating in the ""Ukraine without Kuchma"" protests of 2000–2001. These protests, marked by their intensity and broad support, severely undermined Kuchma's standing both domestically and internationally.[259][260]

During his presidency, Kuchma’s administration was accused of suppressing opposition media outlets and harassing journalists and political opponents. High-profile figures like Viacheslav Chornovil died under mysterious circumstances, further fueling suspicions of state complicity.[261][262][263] Historian Serhy Yekelchyk observed that Kuchma's government ""employed electoral fraud freely"", particularly during the 1999 presidential elections and the 2000 constitutional referendum.[264]

Amid these challenges, Viktor Yushchenko, a respected economist and reformer, rose to prominence. His tenure as the Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine earned him recognition for his professionalism and integrity, which led to his appointment as Prime Minister in 1999, during Kuchma's re-election campaign. Yushchenko was perceived as a technocratic leader capable of addressing Ukraine’s economic stagnation and corruption.[265]

Initially, Yushchenko's government embarked on an ambitious reform agenda. These reforms included fiscal discipline, restructuring of key industries, and efforts to stabilize the economy, which had suffered during Kuchma’s first term. However, Yushchenko's policies soon clashed with the entrenched oligarchic networks that had flourished under Kuchma's protection. These oligarchic factions, wielding significant influence in Parliament and the Kuchma administration, actively resisted reforms that threatened their monopolistic practices and access to state resources.[266]

One of the most contentious episodes of Yushchenko’s premiership was the dismissal of his deputy prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, in 2001. Tymoshenko, who spearheaded anti-corruption initiatives and energy sector reforms, posed a significant challenge to oligarchic interests. Under pressure from Kuchma and oligarchic allies, Yushchenko was forced to dismiss Tymoshenko, a move that symbolized the constraints on reform under Kuchma’s presidency. Shortly after, the Verkhovna Rada, dominated by pro-Kuchma factions, passed a vote of no confidence in Yushchenko’s government, effectively ending his tenure as Prime Minister. Kuchma’s lack of support during this political crisis highlighted the deepening rift between the two leaders.[267][268]

Following his dismissal, Yushchenko became a potent symbol of reform and anti-corruption, gaining significant public support. In 2002, he founded the ""Our Ukraine"" (Nasha Ukrayina) political coalition, which championed pro-Western and democratic ideals. This bloc emerged as a key opposition force against Kuchma’s policies and set the stage for the pivotal 2004 presidential election. In this election, Yushchenko, as the leading opposition candidate, challenged Viktor Yanukovych, Kuchma’s chosen successor, in a contest that would shape Ukraine’s political trajectory for years to come.[269]

In 2004, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma announced he would not seek re-election after serving two terms in office. This decision created a political vacuum that set the stage for a highly contested 2004 presidential election between two main candidates. Viktor Yanukovych, the incumbent Prime Minister, was supported by Kuchma and the Russian Federation. He advocated closer ties with Russia. On the other hand, Viktor Yushchenko, the opposition leader, campaigned as a reformist, emphasizing democratic changes and closer integration with the European Union.[269][270]

The campaign highlighted deep regional and cultural divisions within Ukraine. The western and central regions of the country rallied behind Yushchenko, while the eastern and southern regions strongly supported Yanukovych. A prominent figure in Yushchenko's coalition was Yulia Tymoshenko, a charismatic and polarizing politician. Known for her iconic braided hairstyle and fiery rhetoric, Tymoshenko played a pivotal role in galvanizing support for the opposition. Her speeches and leadership became symbols of the movement for change.[271]

The second round of the presidential election, held on November 21, 2004, officially declared Viktor Yanukovych as the winner. However, widespread allegations of electoral fraud, including ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and falsification of results, led to a political crisis. The situation was further intensified by the attempted poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko with dioxin during the campaign, which left him severely disfigured. This attack garnered widespread sympathy for Yushchenko and galvanized his supporters.[272][273]

The announcement of Yanukovych’s victory sparked massive protests, marking the beginning of the Orange Revolution, a landmark event in Ukraine’s modern history. From November 22, 2004, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered at Kyiv’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), demanding justice, democracy, and fair elections. The protesters adopted the color orange, symbolizing Yushchenko’s campaign and the broader ideals of hope and resistance to corruption and authoritarianism.[269]

Yulia Tymoshenko emerged as a central figure in the revolution, inspiring crowds with her impassioned speeches and coordinating efforts to sustain the movement. The protests remained largely peaceful, with participants emphasizing nonviolence and civil disobedience, despite provocations aimed at inciting unrest. On December 3, 2004, Ukraine’s Supreme Court invalidated the election results due to evidence of fraud and ordered a re-run of the runoff. This repeat election, held on December 26, 2004, resulted in Viktor Yushchenko's victory with 52% of the vote. Yanukovych resigned as Prime Minister, and his cabinet was dismissed on January 5, 2005. Yushchenko's inauguration as president marked the culmination of the Orange Revolution.[274][269]

In February 2005, Yulia Tymoshenko was appointed Prime Minister, cementing her role as a key political figure in post-revolution Ukraine. However, the Orange coalition faced internal struggles during Yushchenko’s presidency. Relations between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko began to deteriorate, weakening the government’s ability to implement reforms. In September 2005, Yushchenko dismissed Tymoshenko from her position as Prime Minister, creating a rift that would have lasting effects on Ukrainian politics.[269][275]

Under Yushchenko, Ukraine’s foreign policy shifted toward strengthening ties with the European Union, often at the expense of its relationship with Russia. This realignment caused tensions, particularly over energy issues. In 2005, a dispute over natural gas prices with Russia resulted in shortages across Europe, as Ukraine served as a critical transit country for gas supplies. A compromise was reached in January 2006, but the incident underscored the fragility of Ukraine's relations with its eastern neighbor.[276][277]

The 2006 parliamentary elections in Ukraine reflected a deeply fragmented political landscape. The elections were marked by the re-emergence of Viktor Yanukovych, a rival of President Viktor Yushchenko and a proponent of closer ties with Russia. Yanukovych’s Party of Regions secured significant support, enabling him to become Prime Minister. This marked a shift in Ukraine’s political orientation, with Yanukovych advocating for a more pro-Russian agenda in contrast to Yushchenko’s pro-European stance. The elections exacerbated tensions between the presidency and parliament, as the balance of power between the two branches of government became a central issue. Frequent political deadlocks ensued, paralyzing governance and delaying key reforms. The strained relationship between Yushchenko and Yanukovych led to a standoff, which ultimately resulted in snap elections in 2007. The snap elections led to the formation of a coalition opposed to Yanukovych’s agenda. Yulia Tymoshenko returned as Prime Minister, yet the political environment remained fraught with instability. Conflicts between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, which had begun earlier, persisted, further weakening the government and contributing to widespread public frustration.[278][279][280]

Tensions reached a breaking point in September 2008, triggering a major political crisis. The crisis began when Yushchenko’s Our Ukraine–People’s Self-Defense Bloc (NU-NS) withdrew from the governing coalition after the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) sided with the opposition Party of Regions in supporting a bill on 4 September 2008 that sought to curtail the president’s powers in favor of the prime minister and parliament. Yushchenko saw this as a direct challenge to his authority, accusing Tymoshenko of betraying the coalition’s principles and aligning with pro-Russian forces. On 16 September 2008, the official collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was announced. As attempts to restore the alliance failed, this led to a deepening political stalemate.[281]

The crisis finally ended on 9 December 2008, when the Orange Coalition was reformed, now including Lytvyn Bloc. This followed the election of Volodymyr Lytvyn as parliamentary speaker on 8 December, securing his faction’s support for a new governing majority. Shortly after, on 16 December 2008, a new government was formed, representing a 245-seat parliamentary majority composed of the Lytvyn Bloc, the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko, and Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc. Though this coalition temporarily stabilized the political landscape, deep divisions among Ukraine’s leadership persisted, continuing to undermine governance and public confidence.[282]

Ukraine was severely impacted by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The crisis led to a sharp economic downturn, with GDP contracting significantly as demand for Ukraine’s key exports, such as steel, plummeted. The government faced a budgetary crisis and had to rely on a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilize the economy. The IMF package came with stringent conditions, including fiscal austerity measures and structural reforms, which sparked domestic controversy. Adding to Ukraine’s economic woes was an escalating energy dispute with Russia. Ukraine, as a major transit country for Russian natural gas to Europe, found itself at the center of geopolitical tensions. Disagreements over gas pricing and transit fees between Ukraine’s Naftogaz and Russia’s Gazprom reached a boiling point in 2009.[283]

The 2009 gas conflict was a major standoff that highlighted Ukraine’s vulnerability and its dependence on Russian energy. The dispute centered on allegations of unpaid bills and demands by Russia for higher gas prices. In January 2009, Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine, plunging several European countries into an energy crisis during the winter. Negotiations eventually resulted in a new agreement, but the episode underscored the fragility of Ukraine’s energy security. The crisis damaged Ukraine’s reputation as a reliable transit country and strained its relations with both Russia and the European Union. It also placed significant financial pressure on the government, further destabilizing the economy.[284]

Throughout this period, the rivalry between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko continued to destabilize Ukrainian politics. Their clashes over policy, governance, and political priorities created a climate of dysfunction. Tymoshenko accused Yushchenko of obstructing her efforts to address economic and social issues, while Yushchenko criticized her populist policies as reckless and counterproductive. These internal conflicts not only hindered progress but also deepened public disillusionment with the political elite.

By the time of Ukraine's 2010 presidential election, the alliance between Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko, key figures of the Orange Revolution, had disintegrated. Tymoshenko competed against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych in a tightly contested three-way race.[285][259] With Yushchenko’s approval rating drastically weakened, many pro-Orange voters abstained, leading to a runoff between Tymoshenko and Yanukovych.[286] In the final round, Yanukovych secured the presidency with 48% of the vote, while Tymoshenko received 45%.[287]

Upon taking office, Yanukovych and his Party of Regions swiftly moved to consolidate power.[288] In March 2010, the newly formed parliamentary majority, the ""Coalition of Stability and Reforms"", dismissed Tymoshenko as Prime Minister, replacing her with Yanukovych’s longtime ally, Mykola Azarov.[289] His administration pursued closer ties with Russia, notably signing the controversial Kharkiv Pact, which extended Russia’s Black Sea Fleet lease in Sevastopol until 2042 in exchange for discounted gas prices. The deal sparked protests from pro-European and nationalist groups, who saw it as a threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty.[290][291]

In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the Party of Regions further strengthened its grip on power, securing the largest number of seats despite widespread allegations of vote-rigging, administrative pressure, and misuse of state resources. The opposition remained fragmented, though it made notable gains. The newly formed UDAR party, led by heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, positioned itself as a pro-European force, while the nationalist Svoboda party, previously on the political margins, unexpectedly surpassed the electoral threshold, capitalizing on growing dissatisfaction with Yanukovych’s rule.[292]

The largest opposition bloc, Batkivshchyna, led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Tymoshenko’s absence, struggled to counterbalance the ruling party’s dominance. By this time, Tymoshenko had been imprisoned since 2011 on charges of abuse of office, a case widely condemned by Western governments and human rights organizations as politically motivated. Her imprisonment, along with the selective prosecution of other opposition figures, was cited as a key reason for the European Union's reluctance to deepen ties with Ukraine under Yanukovych’s leadership.[293]

In late 2013, Ukraine faced a pivotal moment in its modern history. After years of negotiations, the government was expected to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union. However, on 21 November 2013, President Viktor Yanukovych abruptly suspended the signing, citing pressure from Russia. Instead, the government chose closer alignment with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union.[294][295]

This decision sparked mass protests in Kyiv's Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti), led by students, civic activists, and ordinary citizens who saw European integration as a path to democracy, justice, and modernization. The movement, soon known as Euromaidan, quickly grew into a nationwide uprising.[296] Tensions escalated after riot police violently dispersed peaceful demonstrators on 30 November, leading to outrage and a wave of solidarity protests across Ukraine. In Kyiv, protesters built a large encampment in Maidan, while demonstrations spread to other major cities, including Lviv, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Odesa, Donetsk and others.[297]

Political opposition played a key role in organizing the movement. Three major parties stood against Yanukovych's rule: Batkivshchyna (Fatherland), led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk; UDAR, led by boxing champion Vitali Klitschko; and the nationalist Svoboda, led by Oleh Tyahnybok. These parties supported the protests and sought political reforms, including the return to a parliamentary-presidential republic.[298]

In January 2014, the government passed harsh anti-protest laws, further fueling unrest. Violent clashes broke out in central Kyiv, particularly on Hrushevskyi Street. Protesters formed self-defense units, while police used tear gas, rubber bullets, and, eventually, live ammunition.[299][300]

The crisis culminated between 18–20 February, when government snipers opened fire on demonstrators. Around 100 protesters were killed, later honored as the “Heavenly Hundred” (Небесна Сотня). The violence drew international condemnation, prompting the EU and U.S. to impose sanctions on Ukrainian officials.[301][302]

On 21 February 2014, President Yanukovych signed an EU-mediated agreement with opposition leaders to hold early elections and restore the 2004 Constitution. However, amid mounting pressure, mass defections from his party, and the loss of support from law enforcement, Yanukovych fled Kyiv that same night. He traveled by helicopter and a car convoy toward Eastern Ukraine, ultimately crossing into Russia. A few days later, he resurfaced in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, where he held a press conference.[303]

On 22 February 2014, the Verkhovna Rada voted to remove Yanukovych from office, citing his abandonment of constitutional duties. Parliament also voted to release Yulia Tymoshenko from prison. That same day, Volodymyr Rybak, the parliamentary speaker and Yanukovych ally, resigned, and was replaced by Oleksandr Turchynov, a close associate of Tymoshenko. Turchynov was appointed Acting President of Ukraine until new elections could be held.[304]

In March 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea. Although official results of a referendum on Crimean reunification with Russia were reported as showing a large majority in favor of the proposition, the vote was organized under Russian military occupation and was denounced by the European Union and the United States as illegal.[305]

The Crimean crisis was followed by pro-Russian unrest in east Ukraine and south Ukraine.[306] In April 2014 Ukrainian separatists self-proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic and held referendums on 11 May 2014; the separatists claimed nearly 90% voted in favor of independence.[307][306] Later in April 2014, fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-Ukrainian volunteer battalions on one side, and forces supporting the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics on the other side, escalated into the war in Donbas.[306][308] By December 2014, more than 6,400 people had died in this conflict, and according to United Nations figures it led to over half a million people becoming internally displaced within Ukraine and two hundred thousand refugees to flee to (mostly) Russia and other neighboring countries.[309][310][311][312] During the same period, political (including adoption of the law on lustration and the law on decommunization) and economic reforms started.[313] On 25 May 2014, Petro Poroshenko was elected president[314] in the first round of the presidential election. By the second half of 2015, independent observers noted that reforms in Ukraine had considerably slowed down, corruption did not subside, and the economy of Ukraine was still in a deep crisis.[313][315][316][317] By December 2015, more than 9,100 people had died (largely civilians) in the war in Donbas,[318] according to United Nations figures.[319]

The Budapest Memorandum's fragility became evident in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting separatist movements in Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. These actions violated the agreement’s commitments to respect Ukraine's borders and sovereignty. Russia justified its actions by claiming they were protecting Russian-speaking populations, a rationale widely rejected by the international community. Despite protests from Ukraine and Western powers, no direct action was taken to compel Russia to adhere to the memorandum. The crisis exposed the limitations of non-binding agreements, leaving Ukraine in a precarious position and reshaping the global conversation about security assurances and the reliability of international commitments.[320][321][better source needed]

On 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the DCFTA with the EU. Ukrainian citizens were granted visa-free travel to the Schengen Area for up to 90 days during any 180-day period on 11 June 2017, and the Association Agreement formally came into effect on 1 September 2017.[322] Significant achievements in the foreign policy arena include support for anti-Russian sanctions, obtaining a visa-free regime with the countries of the European Union, and better recognition of the need to overcome extremely difficult tasks within the country. However, the old local authorities did not want any changes; they were cleansed of anti-Maidan activists (lustration), but only in part. The fight against corruption was launched, but was limited to sentences of petty officials and electronic declarations, and the newly established NABU and NACP were marked by scandals in their work. Judicial reform was combined with the appointment of old, compromised judges. The investigation of crimes against Maidan residents was delayed. In order to counteract the massive global Russian anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the ""information war"", the Ministry of Information Policy was created, which for 5 years did not show effective work, except for the ban on Kaspersky Lab, Dr.Web, 1С, Mail.ru, Yandex and Russian social networks VKontakte or Odnoklassniki and propaganda media. In 2017, the president signed the law ""On Education"", which met with opposition from national minorities, and quarreled with the Government of Hungary.[citation needed].[323]

On 19 May 2018, Poroshenko signed a Decree which put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council on the final termination of Ukraine's participation in the statutory bodies of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[324][325] As of February 2019, Ukraine minimized its participation in the Commonwealth of Independent States to a critical minimum and effectively completed its withdrawal. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine did not ratify the accession, i.e. Ukraine has never been a member of the CIS.[326]

The Kerch Strait incident occurred on 25 November 2018 when the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels attempting to pass from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol.[327][328]

On 6 January 2019, in Fener, a delegation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine with the participation of President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko received a Tomos on autocephaly. The Tomos was presented to the head of the OCU, Metropolitan Epiphanius, during a joint liturgy with the Ecumenical Patriarch.[329] The next day, Tomos was brought to Ukraine for a demonstration at St. Sophia Cathedral. On 9 January, all members of the Synod of the Constantinople Orthodox Church signed the Tomos during the scheduled meeting of the Synod.[citation needed]

On 21 February 2019, the Constitution of Ukraine was amended, with the norms on the strategic course of Ukraine for membership in the European Union and NATO being enshrined in the preamble of the Basic Law, three articles and transitional provisions.[330]

On 21 April 2019, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected president in the second round of the presidential election. Early parliamentary elections on 21 July allowed the newly formed pro-presidential Servant of the People party to win an absolute majority of seats for the first time in the history of independent Ukraine (248). Dmytro Razumkov, the party's chairman, was elected speaker of parliament. The majority was able to form a government on 29 August on its own, without forming coalitions, and approved Oleksii Honcharuk as prime minister.[331] On 4 March 2020, due to a 1.5% drop in GDP (instead of a 4.5% increase at the time of the election), the Verkhovna Rada fired Honcharuk's government and Denys Shmyhal[332] became the new Prime Minister.[333]

On 28 July 2020, in Lublin, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine created the Lublin Triangle initiative, which aims to create further cooperation between the three historical countries of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and further Ukraine's integration and accession to the EU and NATO.[334]

On 2 February 2021, a presidential decree banned the television broadcasting of the pro-Russian TV channels 112 Ukraine, NewsOne and ZIK.[335][336] The decision of the National Security and Defense Council and the Presidential Decree of 19 February 2021 imposed sanctions on 8 individuals and 19 legal entities, including Putin's pro-Russian politician and Putin's godfather Viktor Medvedchuk and his wife Oksana Marchenko.[337][338]

On 17 May 2021, the Association Trio was formed by signing a joint memorandum between the Foreign Ministers of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Association Trio is tripartite format for the enhanced cooperation, coordination, and dialogue between the three countries (that have signed the Association Agreement with the EU) with the European Union on issues of common interest related to European integration, enhancing cooperation within the framework of the Eastern Partnership, and committing to the prospect of joining the European Union.[339]

At the June 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO leaders reiterated the decision taken at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine would become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process and Ukraine's right to determine its own future and foreign policy without outside interference.[340]

Throughout 2021, Russian forces built up along the Russia-Ukraine Border, in occupied Crimea, Donbas, and Belarus.[341] On 24 February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine.[342] Russia quickly occupied much of the east and south of the country, but failed to advance past the city of Mykolaiv towards Odesa, and were forced to retreat from the north after failing to occupy Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv.[343] After failing to gain further territories and being driven out of Kharkiv Oblast by a fast-paced Ukrainian counteroffensive,[344] Russia declared the annexation of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, along with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts on 30 September.

The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states all declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, along with mass arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia, which also enacted a law enabling greater media censorship. Over 1,000 companies closed their operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion.[345]

On the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the country was the poorest in Europe,[346] a handicap whose cause was attributed to high corruption levels[347] and the slow pace of economic liberalization and institutional reform.[348][349][350][351] Russia's invasion of the country damaged Ukraine's economy and future prospects of improvement to such an extent, that the GDP of the country was projected to shrink by as much as 35% in its first year alone after the invasion.[352]

Ukraine was originally preparing to formally apply for EU membership in 2024, but instead signed an application for membership in February 2022.[353]

Knowledge about Ukraine in other parts of the world came chiefly from Russian secondary sources until relatively recently. After the second half of the seventeenth century, when Muscovy and later the Russian Empire came to control much of Ukrainian territory, Russian writers included Ukraine as part of Russian history. This included referring to medieval Kievan Rus' as ""Kievan Russia"" and its Old East Slavic culture and inhabitants as ""Kievan Russian"" or ""Old Russian"". Later Ukraine or its parts were called ""Little Russia"", ""South Russia"", ""West Russia"" (with Belarus), or ""New Russia"" (the Black Sea coast and southeastern steppe). But parts of Ukraine beyond Russia's reach were called Ruthenia and its people Ruthenians. The names chosen to refer to Ukraine and Ukrainians have often reflected a certain political position, and sometimes even to deny the existence of Ukrainian nationality.[36]: 10–11  The Russian point-of-view of Ukrainian history became the prevailing one in Western academia, and although the bias was identified as early as the 1950s, many scholars of Slavic studies and history believe significant changes are still necessary to correct the Moscow-centric view.[354]

The scholarly study of Ukraine's history emerged from romantic impulses in the late 19th century when German Romanticism spread to Eastern Europe. The outstanding leaders were Volodymyr Antonovych (1834–1908), based in Kiev, and his student Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1866–1934).[355] The first serious challenge to the Russian view of Ukraine was Hrushevsky's 1904 article ""The Traditional Scheme of 'Russian' History and the Problem of the Rational organization of the History of the Eastern Slavs"".[356] For the first time full-scale scholarly studies based on archival sources, modern research techniques, and modern historical theories became possible. However, the demands of government officials—Tsarist, to a lesser degree Austro-Hungarian and Polish, and later Soviet—made it difficult to disseminate ideas that ran counter to the central government. Therefore, exile schools of historians emerged in central Europe and Canada after 1920.[citation needed]

Strikingly different interpretations of the medieval state of Kievan Rus' appear in the four schools of historiography within Ukraine: Russophile, Sovietophile, Eastern Slavic, and Ukrainophile. In the Soviet Union, there was a radical break after 1921, led by Mikhail Pokrovsky. Until 1934, history was generally not regarded as chauvinistic, but was rewritten in the style of Marxist historiography. National ""pasts"" were rewritten as social and national liberation for non-Russians, and social liberation for Russians, in a process that ended in 1917. Under Stalin, the state and its official historiography were given a distinct Russian character and a certain Russocentrism. Imperial history was rewritten such that non-Russian love caused an emulation and deference to ""join"" the Russian people by becoming part of the (tsarist) Russian state, and in return, Russian state interests were driven by altruism and concern for neighboring people.[357] Russophile and Sovietophile schools have become marginalized in independent Ukraine, with the Ukrainophile school being dominant in the early 21st century. The Ukrainophile school promotes an identity that is mutually exclusive of Russia. It has come to dominate the nation's educational system, security forces, and national symbols and monuments, although it has been dismissed as nationalist by Western historians. The East Slavic school, an eclectic compromise between Ukrainophiles and Russophilism, has a weaker ideological and symbolic base, although it is preferred by Ukraine's centrist former elites.[358]

Many historians in recent years have sought alternatives to national histories, and Ukrainian history invited approaches that looked beyond a national paradigm. Multiethnic history recognises the numerous peoples in Ukraine; transnational history portrays Ukraine as a border zone for various empires; and area studies categorises Ukraine as part of East-Central Europe or, less often, as part of Eurasia. Serhii Plokhy argues that looking beyond the country's national history has made possible a richer understanding of Ukraine, its people, and the surrounding regions.[359] since 2015, there has been renewed interest in integrating a ""territorial-civic"" and ""linguistic-ethnic"" history of Ukraine. For example, the history of the Crimean Tatars and the more distant history of the Crimea peninsula is now integrated into Ukrainian school history. This is part of the constitutionally mandated ""people of Ukraine"" rather than ""Ukrainian people"". Slowly, the histories of Poles and Jews are also being reintegrated. However, due to the current political climate caused by territorial sovereignty breaches by Russia, the role of Russians as ""co-host"" has been greatly minimized, and there are still unresolved difficult issues of the past, for example, the role of Ukrainians during the Holodomor.[360]: 98

After 1991, historical memory was a powerful tool in the political mobilization and legitimation of the post-Soviet Ukrainian state, as well as the division of selectively used memory along the lines of the political division of Ukrainian society. Ukraine did not experience the restorationist paradigm typical of some other post-Soviet nations, for example the three Baltic countries—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—although the multifaceted history of independence, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, Soviet-era repressions, mass famine, and World War II collaboration were used to provide a different constitutive frame for developing Ukrainian nationhood. The politics of identity (which includes the production of history textbooks and the authorization of commemorative practices) has remained fragmented and tailored to reflect the ideological anxieties and concerns of individual regions of Ukraine.[361]

In Soviet Ukraine, twentieth-century historians were strictly limited in the range of models and topics they could cover, with Moscow insisting on an official Marxist approach. However, émigré Ukrainians in Canada developed an independent scholarship that ignored Marxism, and shared the Western tendencies in historiography.[362] George W. Simpson and Orest Subtelny were leaders promoting Ukrainian studies in Canadian academe.[363] The lack of independence in Ukraine meant that traditional historiographical emphases on diplomacy and politics were handicapped. The flourishing of social history after 1960 opened many new approaches for researchers in Canada; Subtelny used the modernization model. Later historiographical trends were quickly adapted to the Ukrainian evidence, with special focus on Ukrainian nationalism. The new cultural history, post-colonial studies, and the ""linguistic turn"" augmenting, if not replacing social history, allowed for multiple angles of approach. By 1991, historians in Canada had freely explored a wide range of approaches regarding the emergence of a national identity. After independence, a high priority in Canada was assisting in the freeing of Ukrainian scholarship from Soviet-Marxist orthodoxy—which downplayed Ukrainian nationalism and insisted that true Ukrainians were always trying to reunite with Russia. Independence from Moscow meant freedom from an orthodoxy that was never well suited to Ukrainian developments. Scholars in Ukraine welcomed the ""national paradigm"" that Canadian historians had helped develop. Since 1991, the study of Ukrainian nation-building became an increasingly global and collaborative enterprise, with scholars from Ukraine studying and working in Canada, and with conferences on related topics attracting scholars from around the world.[364]

First Congress of Lithuanian Women,"The First Congress of Lithuanian Women (Lithuanian: Pirmasis lietuvių moterų suvažiavimas) took place on 6–7 October [O.S. 23–24 September] 1907[1] in Kaunas (then part of the Russian Empire, now Lithuania). It was organized by Catholic priests in preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma but discussed only cultural and economic issues. The organizers attempted to invite representatives of different social classes and political affiliations leading to disagreements between socialists and Catholic clergy, and between educated intellectuals and less educated villagers. The congress resolved to establish the Lithuanian Women's Union. However, disagreements between the liberals and the Catholics led to splintering of the women's movement and to the establishment of the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922.

The Lithuanian Women's Association was established in September 1905 during the Russian Revolution in Vilnius. It was organized and headed by women members of the intelligentsia. Different developments took place in Kaunas where women's issues were taken up by the members of the Catholic clergy, particularly by priest Povilas Januševičius [lt]. The priests organized the Society of Saint Zita for female servants and maids.[2]

In preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma, Januševičius organized the First Congress of Lithuanian Women (the women were not allowed to vote in the election).[2] According to Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, the congress originated from an idea to establish a shop of homemade textiles and a need to recruit village women for the enterprise.[3] There were very few women intellectuals in Kaunas. The priests selected seven women for the organizational committee, however, according to Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, only one of them – Cecilija Leonienė, the wife of attorney Petras Leonas – had attended a gymnasium. The organizational committee invited women from villagers (more conservative and Catholic) and the women intellectuals from Vilnius (more liberal and anti-religious). To obtain the government permit for the gathering, it would not discuss any social or political issues, only cultural and economic affairs.[2]

The congress was opened by writer Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė. Priests then wanted to elect a board to preside over the congress with a priest as its chairman. Petkevičaitė felt it was insulting to the women and proposed herself as the chair of the congress. She also proposed Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė and Marija Pečkauskaitė as vice-chairs, Ona Pleirytė-Puidienė [lt] as secretary, and Petras Leonas as advisor. According to Leonas, due to poor health and weak voice, Petkevičaitė presided over the proceedings only on paper; Pleirytė-Puidienė managed most of the actual work.[2] None of the members of the original organizational committee got included on the board which left them feeling sidelined and snubbed.[3]

The proceedings opened with a cantata about Lithuanian women composed specifically for the event by Ksaveras Sakalauskas-Vanagėlis [lt].[2] The first day featured several speeches and presentations on the women's movement in Lithuania by Leonienė, on hardships of village women by Julija Žymantienė-Žemaitė, on public duties (e.g. working as low-paid teachers or volunteer as nurses) of women intellectuals by Petkevičaitė, on women's professional education by Teresė Kubilinskaitė [lt], on teaching the history of Lithuania by Kymantaitė-Čiurlioninenė, on women's honor by Pečkauskaitė, on schools, on ways to combat alcoholism, on homemade textiles, on vegetables and fruits. Most speakers stressed the need for education to improve one's circumstances. Women attendees also complained about their suffering – villagers about husbands who abused alcohol, city maids and servants about their exploitative employers.[2] The women planned to publish a book will all presentations, but could not find a publisher.[1] Three presentations were published in Vilniaus žinios.[3]

The second day saw more heated debates between socialists and Catholic clergy.[2] Men became more active during these debates; they constituted a third of all speakers.[3] The congress discussed whether to establish a newspaper dedicated to women's issues as well as the relationship between Lithuanian Women's Association and the Russian Union for Women's Equality. It was decided that the Lithuanian association should not become a chapter of the Russian union and should collaborate with the union as long as this collaboration did not hinder the women's movement in Lithuania. The congress concluded with the adoption of a resolution which called for the establishment of the new Lithuanian Women's Union which would participate in the international women's movement. Most contentious issue was the election of a 10-member committee to organize this new union as socialists and Catholic clergy fought for influence.[2] The committee included Gabrielė Petkevičaitė as chair, Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė and Marija Pečkauskaitė as vicechairs, Ona Pleirytė-Puidienė [lt] and Marija Putvinskaitė-Žmuidzinavičienė [lt] as secretaries, Celina Leonienė and Kotryna Norkytė as treasurers, and Joana Griniuvienė, Elena Vaitkevičienė, and Teklė Augustinavičiūtė as members of the revision sub-committee. Several other women, including Felicija Bortkevičienė and Julija Žymantienė, were selected as candidates in case of any resignations.[1]

The apolitical agenda attracted representatives from different organizations and political parties. Therefore, the congress included women from different social classes and political convictions but since the proceedings were in the Lithuanian language, other nationalities (Russian, Polish, Jewish) were not represented. The total number of attendees is unknown. Participants later put estimates ranging from 350 to 700. The attendees had to purchase tickets that cost 25 kopeks for women and one ruble for men.[2]

The women attendees included essentially all Lithuanian cultural elite at the time – Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė, Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, Ona Pleirytė-Puidienė [lt], Julija Žymantienė-Žemaitė, Marija Pečkauskaitė (Šatrijos Ragana), Cecilija Leonienė, Felicija Bortkevičienė, Liudvika Didžiulienė, Marija Putvinskaitė-Žmuidzinavičienė [lt], Teresė Kubilinskaitė [lt]. Men participants included Petras Leonas, Mykolas Sleževičius, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, Konstantinas Olšauskas, Povilas Dogelis [lt], Vincas Kapsukas, Karolis Požela, Steponas Kairys, Augustinas Janulaitis,[2] Kazys Grinius.[3]

The congress failed to unify women activists – women's movement in Lithuania split into two main branches: conservative Catholic and liberal-socialist.[4] The disagreements became evident during the congress and only deepened when each side began publishing accusing articles in the Lithuanian press.[3] The 10-member committee started working on the statute of the planned Lithuanian Women's Union. The first draft was prepared mainly by Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė and Pleirytė-Puidienė based on the statute of the Russian Union for Women's Equality.[1] In November, the statute was submitted to the Governor-General of Vilna for approval, but it was rejected. The Catholics protested this statute as they wanted to copy examples of organizations of Belgian and German Catholic women, not Russian liberals.[1] After a failed attempt to find a compromise in December 1907, the Catholic camp established the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Catholic association was approved by Kovno Governorate. The Tsarist authorities would not approve another women's organization thus effectively preventing the Lithuanian Women's Union from being organized.[1] The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922.[5]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Congress_of_Lithuanian_Women
Treaty of Salynas,"The Treaty of Salynas (German: Frieden von Sallinwerder, Lithuanian: Salyno sutartis) was a peace treaty signed on 12 October 1398 by Vytautas the Great, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and Konrad von Jungingen, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights. It was signed on an islet of the Neman River, probably between Kulautuva and the mouth of the Nevėžis River.[1] It was the third time, after the Treaty of Königsberg (1384) and Treaty of Lyck (1390), that Vytautas promised Samogitia to the Knights.[1] The territory was important to the Knights as it physically separated the Teutonic Knights in Prussia from its branch in Livonia.[2] It was the first time that the Knights and Vytautas attempted to enforce the cession of Samogitia.[3] However, it did not solve the territorial disputes over Samogitia and they dragged on until the Treaty of Melno in 1422.

When Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, married Jadwiga of Poland and was crowned as King of Poland in 1386, he appointed his unpopular brother Skirgaila as viceroy for Lithuania. Vytautas seized the opportunity to renew his struggle for power and started the Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–1392. He allied himself with the Teutonic Knights, promising them Samogitia. However, Jogaila and Vytautas reconciled in 1392 by signing the Treaty of Astrava. The Knights, betrayed by Vytautas, invaded Lithuania in 1394 and unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius for three weeks.[1] The invaders were driven away by joint Lithuanian and Polish forces, demonstrating that the old raids were no longer effective against the new Polish–Lithuanian alliance.[3] A truce between Vytautas and the Knights was signed in 1396. Vytautas needed to secure his western front as he was planning a massive campaign against the Golden Horde, which resulted in a disaster at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399.[4]

Vytautas' friend and former captive, Marquard von Salzbach, helped to negotiate the agreement. A preliminary treaty was signed on 23 March 1398, in Hrodna; it was finalized in October 1398.[3] According to the treaty Samogitia was ceded to the Knights roughly up to the Nevėžis River, leaving the mouth of Nevėžis in Vytautas' hands. For the first time the Order also received a portion of Sudovia, an almost uninhabited territory north and west of the Šešupė River.[2] The treaty recognized spheres of influence: Veliky Novgorod for Vytautas and Pskov for the Knights.[3] Vytautas also promised to help the Knights build two new castles as compensation for castles he burned in 1392.[1] The Knights promised to help Vytautas in his campaign against the Tatars. The treaty also guaranteed freedom of trade. Sigismund Kęstutaitis and other hostages kept by the Knights since the Civil War were released.[4]

During the week-long celebration following successful negotiations, Lithuanian nobles proclaimed Vytautas as King of Lithuania.[2] While such a declaration had no political force, it was a reply to demands by Jadwiga of Poland to pay Polish taxes.[4] It showed their determination to keep the Grand Duchy of Lithuania separate from the Kingdom of Poland despite the Union of Krewo in 1385.[5] Such a proclamation, known only from the chronicles of Johann von Posilge, raised doubts as to reliability among Polish historians.[3] The treaty is noted among Lithuanian historians as it showed the extent of Vytautas' power in Lithuania: he made territorial concessions without approval from Jogaila, who theoretically was the Supreme Duke of Lithuania.[5]

After signing the treaty, the Order attempted to take control of Samogitia. They took many hostages into Prussia and presented Samogitian nobles with gifts such as wool, salt, and clothes. They also built fortresses – one with Vytautas' help near the Nevėžis River and another (named Friedeburg) near Dubysa.[1] The Knights tried to maintain a friendly relationship with Vytautas, warmly welcoming his wife Anna during her pilgrimage to the tomb of Dorothy of Montau, and sent him gifts.[6] However, disagreements soon arose when the Order demanded the return of about 4000 peasants who had escaped into Lithuania. Vytautas argued that they were free people and had the right to choose where to live.[3] The disagreement grew into a war.

Vytautas renounced the Lithuanian sovereignty over Pskov which had been under Lithuanian influence in the second half of 14th century, and accepted that it was in the Teutonic Order's sphere of influence. This caused Pskov to accept the suzerainty of the Great Duchy of Moscow in 1399.[7]

In March 1401, Vytautas signed the Union of Vilnius and Radom in January 1401.[8] Assured of Polish support, he violated the treaty, supporting a local rebellion of the Samogitians, capturing and burning the two newly built castles. In the fall of 1401 the Knights raided Kaunas and Hrodna; in May 1402 the Samogitians burned Klaipėda.[3] Vytautas joined the conflict in 1402 by attacking Gotteswerder.[1] Jogaila's brother Švitrigaila joined the war on the side of the Teutonic Knights as he had laid claim to the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[8] He confirmed the Treaty of Salynas in exchange for Order's military assistance.

Neither side could achieve decisive victory, however, and Vytautas wished to concentrate his attention on troubles in Smolensk, so the Treaty of Raciąż was signed on 22 May 1404.[8] It mirrored the Treaty of Salynas, but did not solve the disputes. The second Samogitian uprising in 1409 resulted in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Salynas

Lithuanian Auxiliary Police,"The Lithuanian Auxiliary Police was a Schutzmannschaft formation formed during the German occupation of Lithuania between 1941 and 1944, with the first battalions originating from the most reliable freedom fighters, disbanded following the 1941 anti-Soviet Lithuanian June Uprising in 1941.[3] Lithuanian activists hoped that these units would be the basis of a reestablished Lithuanian Army commanded by the Lithuanian Provisional Government.[4] Instead, they were put under the orders of the SS- und Polizeiführer in Lithuania.[5]

Lithuanian auxiliary policemen were divided into four types. The first three were: regular law enforcement policemen, firefighting policemen, and auxiliary units grouped into platoons that assisted the local police when needed.[2] The last were Lithuanian Schutzmannschaft battalions, closed formations organized into battalions, companies, platoons and groups.[2]

The battalions were charged with internal security duties and engaged in anti-partisan operations in the Wehrmacht's rear areas, e.g. Ukraine, Belarus, Poland and Northwest Russia.[6] Some battalions took part in the Holocaust, most notably the 12th and the 13th battalions, which started as the Lithuanian TDA Battalions. These two battalions were responsible for an estimated 78,000 Jewish deaths in Lithuania and Belarus.[citation needed] While the battalions were often deployed outside Lithuania, they generally did not participate in combat. In total, 26 battalions were formed and approximately 20,000[7] men served in them.[8] In July to September 1944, the remaining units were combined into two Lithuanian Volunteer Infantry Regiments.[9]

The units are known under a number of names. German documents referred to them as Ordnungsdienst (order service), Selbstschutz (self-defense), and Hilfspolizei (auxiliary police).[10] From September 1941, they became known as Schutzmannschaft-Bataillonen (abbreviated Schuma). In Lithuanian, the police battalions were known as savisaugos batalionai (self-defense battalions), apsaugos dalys (security units), Lietuvos apsaugos dalys (LAD, security units of Lithuania).[10]

Lithuanian Police Battalions are controversial and poorly researched.[citation needed] The main obstacle is the lack of reliable and objective data. During the war, journal Karys published frequent stories about the battalions, but to protect military secrets the articles were heavily censored to remove names, dates, and locations. During the Soviet period, when Soviet propaganda exploited tales of war crimes and actively persecuted former members of the battalions, objective research was impossible. Several members of the battalions managed to escape to the West and publish memoirs, but they gloss over the controversial aspects of the battalions and often deny Lithuanian involvement in the Holocaust.[11] Foreign researchers were hampered by lack of archival data.

When Lithuania declared independence, the archives became accessible to scholars. However, the documents are scattered in various archives in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Germany and Russia. In addition, recordkeeping was poor, particularly towards the end of the war. The units were subject to frequent reorganizations and restructurings; sometimes the units were themselves confused about their names or numbers. In the post-war years, the KGB produced interrogation protocols of former members of the battalions, but these are not considered reliable, as confessions were often obtained through torture or fabricated outright. Nevertheless, Lithuanian scholars, primarily Arūnas Bubnys, have published several articles analyzing the structure and activities of individual battalions.[11]

In June 1940, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union. The Soviets introduced harsh sovietization policies, including nationalization of larger enterprises, landholdings, and real estate.[12] Opponents of communism and the new regime were persecuted: an estimated 6,600 were imprisoned as ""enemies of the people""[13] and another 17,600 deported to Siberia.[14] The Lithuanian Army was reorganized into the 29th Rifle Corps (179th Rifle and 184th Rifle Divisions) of the Red Army. More than 500 Lithuanian officers retired and 87 were imprisoned.[15]

The Lithuanian Activist Front was formed in Berlin by Kazys Škirpa, former Lithuanian envoy to Germany. Its goal was to organize an anti-Soviet uprising in the event of a German-Soviet war.[16] When Nazi Germany invaded Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, some Lithuanians greeted the Germans as liberators from the repressive Soviet rule.[17] Many spontaneously joined the anti-Soviet June Uprising. The Provisional Government of Lithuania declared independence and Lithuanians began to form their own military and police units in hopes of recreating the Lithuanian Army.[18] The territory of Lithuania was invaded by and divided between two German Army Groups:Army Group North took over western and northern Lithuania, and Army Group Centre took over most of the Vilnius Region.[19] Therefore, developments in Kaunas and Vilnius were parallel but separate. The Germans had no intention of giving the Lithuanians independence, so the provisional government was dissolved on August 5, 1941 and partisan units disarmed. On September 26, the LAF was also dissolved and Lithuania was incorporated into the German civil administration.[20]

In the short period when the Lithuanians hoped to rebuild the state, they reconstituted part of the pre-war police, reaching about 40% (3,000 men) of its pre-war numbers, and began to recreate the army.[21] On July 5, however, German authorities forbade the reconstitution of the Lithuanian army, or any units other than self-defense units, which the Germans transformed into auxiliary police units.[22] In November, all auxiliary policemen in the eastern territories, including Lithuania, were considered Schutzmannschaften.[21]

Schutzmannschaften were divided into four types. The first was a regular police force, stationed in cities and provinces. The second type, closed formations, were organized into battalions, companies, platoons and groups. The third type was  firefighting units. The fourth, auxiliary units grouped into platoons and companies, assisted regular police when needed.[2]

The first battalion, known as the Tautinio darbo apsaugos batalionas (TDA), was formed by the Provisional Government in Kaunas on June 28.[18] The Provisional Government was dissolved on August 5, 1941. The battalion was not dissolved and German Major Franz Lechthaler [de] took over its command.[18] On August 7, the TDA had 703 members and Lechthaler ordered it reorganized into two battalions of auxiliary police (German: Polizeihilfsdienst bataillone; Lithuanian: Pagalbinės policijos tarnyba or PPT). During August three more battalions of PPT were formed. In October, these five battalions were renamed security battalions (Lithuanian: apsaugos batalionas). In December, the five battalions were reorganized again into battalions of Schutzmannschaft.

Lithuanians massively deserted from the Soviet 29th Rifle Corps and gathered in Vilnius. They organized Lithuanian Self-defense Units (Lithuanian: Lietuvių savisaugos dalys or LSD) in Vilnius, Pabradė, Trakai, and Varėna.[23] On July 21, 1941, LSD was reorganized into the Vilnius Reconstruction Service (Lithuanian: Vilniaus atstatymo tarnyba or VAT) with three units (Work, Order, and Security). On August 1, VAT and its three units were reorganized into three battalions of Schutzmannschaft.[24] Two more battalions were organized by October 1941.

Some Lithuanian auxiliary police battalions took an active part in the extermination of Jewish people in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and Poland and committed crimes against the Polish and Belarusian populations. For example the 12th Police Battalion liquided Jews in Kaunas in October 1941 under the command of Antanas Impulevičius. Later that the TBD 12th battalion murdered the entire Jewish population of Slutsk in Belarus. The 2nd Police Battalion served as guards at the Majdanek death camp in occupied Poland. Of 26 Lithuanian Auxiliary Police battalions, 10 were directly involved in the destruction of Jewish people in Eastern Europe.[25] According to German reports[specify], Lithuanians committed 47,000 killings of Jews in Lithuania out of all 85,000 committed by Einsatzkommando there. They also killed 50,000 Belarusian Jews during the war.[26] The largest crime against the non-Jewish civilian population by Lithuanian policemen was the killings of Polish people in the villages of Švenčionėliai and Švenčionys and their surroundings.[27]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Auxiliary_Police

Law of Lithuania,"Lithuanian law is a part of the legal system of Lithuania. It belongs to the  civil law legal system, as opposed to the common law legal system.[1] 
The legal system of Lithuania is based on epitomes of the French and German systems. The Lithuanian legal system is grounded on the principles laid out in the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania and safeguarded by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Lithuania.

The origins of Lithuanian law trace back to the first written source, the Casimir Code (Lithuanian: Kazimiero teisynas), published in 1468 by the Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir Jagiellon with the Lithuanian Council of Lords.  It is considered to be the first codified law of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Statutes of Lithuania, published three times (in 1529, 1566 and 1588) were the most influent legal codes of Lithuania.  The third variant of the Statute was in force in the territory of Lithuania until 1840 when it got replaced by the Russian laws.  However, under the rule of the Russian Empire, there were three separate civil law systems in force in Lithuania: in Suvalkija the Napoleonic Code was still applied, whereas the German law was in force in  Klaipėda Region.

The legal system of independent Lithuania between the World Wars was influenced by the fact that three separate systems of civil law governed various parts of the country, while the autonomous Klaipėda Region had its own legal instruments.  The notable difference from the rest of the state was the possibility of a secular civil marriage in the 1930s and 1940s.  The drafting of Lithuanian legal codes went on for decades and was not completed until World War II. During the Soviet occupation, the adapted variation of the Soviet law was in force in Lithuania.

After regaining of independence in 1990, the largely modified Soviet legal codes were in force for about a decade.  The modern Constitution of Lithuania was adopted on 25 October 1992.  In 2001 the Civil Code of Lithuania was passed in Seimas.  It was succeeded by the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure Code in 2003.  The approach to the criminal law is inquisitorial, as opposed to adversarial; it is generally characterised by an insistence on formality and rationalisation, as opposed to practicality and informality[clarification needed].

The civil law and commercial law is codified in a single legal act - the Civil Code of the Republic of Lithuania [1] (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos civilinis kodeksas) which is in force since 1 July 2001. It is influenced by the civil codes of Quebec and the Netherlands. The commercial law in Lithuania is of an increasingly excellent drafting quality and the market in Lithuanian legal services is now increasingly competitive.

Legal professionals are prepared and the law is researched in departments of three universities of Lithuania:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Lithuania
Ministry of Justice (Lithuania),"The Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos Respublikos teisingumo ministerija) was established in 1918. Its departments include European Law, prisons, state-guaranteed legal aid services in several major Lithuania cities, a patent bureau, consumer rights protection, the Law Institute, the Metrology Inspectorate, state enterprise and legal information centers, and forensic science.

The Ministry of Justice was first established on 11 November 1918.[1] Its first minister was Petras Leonas.[1]

Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty,"The Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty (Lithuanian: Lietuvos-Sovietų Sąjungos savitarpio pagalbos sutartis, Russian: советско-литовский договор о взаимопомощи, romanized: sovetsko-litovskiy dogovor o vzaimopomoshchi) was a bilateral treaty signed between the Soviet Union and Lithuania on October 10, 1939. According to provisions outlined in the treaty, Lithuania would acquire about one fifth of the Vilnius Region, including Lithuania's historical capital, Vilnius, and in exchange would allow five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops to be established across Lithuania. In essence the treaty with Lithuania was very similar to the treaties that the Soviet Union signed with Estonia on September 28, and with Latvia on October 5. According to official Soviet sources, the Soviet military was strengthening the defenses of a weak nation against possible attacks by Nazi Germany.[1] The treaty provided that Lithuania's sovereignty would not be affected.[2] However, in reality the treaty opened the door for the first Soviet occupation of Lithuania and was described by The New York Times as ""virtual sacrifice of independence.""[3]

Lithuania declared independence from the Russian Empire on February 16, 1918. On June 12, 1920, following the Lithuanian–Soviet War, a Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was signed. The Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence and its right to the Vilnius Region. The region was fiercely contested with Poland and fell under its control after Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920. It was then incorporated into the Republic of Central Lithuania which was a short-lived political entity without international recognition. The region was ceded to Poland in 1922 at the Peace of Riga after the Polish–Soviet War and confirmed internationally by the League of Nations.[4] The Lithuanians refused to recognize Polish control and continued to claim legal and moral rights to the region throughout the interwar period. The Soviet Union continued to support Lithuanian claims against sovereign Poland. The Soviets supported as well Lithuania's interests in the Klaipėda Region after the Klaipėda Revolt and signed the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact in 1926, later extended it to 1944.[5]

On August 23, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and divided Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. According to the pact's secret protocols, Lithuania was assigned to the German sphere of influence while Latvia and Estonia, the other two  Baltic states, were assigned to the Soviets.[6] This different treatment could be explained by Lithuania's economic dependence on Germany. Germany accounted for approximately 80% of Lithuania's foreign trade and after the 1939 German ultimatum had control of Klaipėda, Lithuania's only port.[7] Also, Lithuania and Russia did not have a common border.[8]

On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. The Wehrmacht pushed Polish forces behind the line agreed with the Soviets. Germans took control of the Lublin Voivodeship and eastern Warsaw Voivodeship.[9] When on September 17 the Red Army invaded Poland, Soviet  troops took over Vilnius Region, which according to the 1920 and 1926 Soviet–Lithuanian treaties was recognized to Lithuania.[9] As a result, Soviets and Germans re-negotiated the secret protocols of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On September 28, 1939, they signed the Boundary and Friendship Treaty.[10] Its secret attachment detailed that to compensate the Soviet Union for German-occupied Polish territories, Germany would transfer Lithuania, except for a small territory in Suvalkija, to the Soviet sphere of influence.[11] The exchange of territories was also motivated by Soviet control of Vilnius: the Soviet Union could exert significant influence on the Lithuanian government, which claimed Vilnius to be its de jure capital.[12] In the secret protocols, both Soviet Union and Germany explicitly recognized Lithuanian interest in Vilnius.[13]

On September 29, the next day after the Boundary and Friendship Treaty, Germany canceled planned talks with Lithuania and the Soviet Union informed Lithuania that it wished to open negotiations regarding future relationship between the two countries.[14] The new Soviet–Lithuanian negotiations were supposed to formally resolve the status of the Vilnius Region.[9] Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys arrived in Moscow on October 3 to meet with Soviet leaders. During the meeting Joseph Stalin personally informed Urbšys about the Soviet–German secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence.[15] He demanded that Lithuania sign three separate treaties, according to which:[16]

Urbšys protested the Soviet bases arguing that it would mean virtual occupation of Lithuania.[14] The Soviets argued that their army would protect Lithuania from possible attacks from Nazi Germany and that a similar treaty was already signed with Estonia. Urbšys argued that Lithuania's neutrality was enough to guarantee its security and proposed to strengthen the Lithuanian army.[16] According to Lithuanian brigadier general Musteikis, who accompanied him, Urbšys said that Lithuania refused to annex the Vilnius Region as well as rejecting the Soviet garrisons. Stalin, though nervous, replied ""No matter if you take Vilnius or not, Soviet troops will enter Lithuania anyway.""[17] Finally, the Soviets agreed to reduce the number of troops to 35,000.[14] Urbšys then also bargained for more territories in the Vilnius Region, especially in the vicinity of Druskininkai and Švenčionys, territories with larger Lithuanian populations.[16] The Soviets replied that the boundary drawn by the 1920 peace treaty was inaccurate and that Belarusians also laid claims to the territory.[14] The Soviets tentatively agreed that territories where a Lithuanian majority could be proven would be transferred to Lithuania.[16] Nevertheless, the Soviets threatened the Lithuanians that if they will not accept the Mutual Assistance Treaty, Vilnius will be attached to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[18] The most shocking demand was to cede Lithuanian territory to Germany.[14] Lithuania decided to postpone any negotiations regarding territory transfer to Germany until Germany expressed clear demands.[14]

Urbšys returned to Lithuania to consult the government. German officials confirmed that the secret protocols were real, and informed Lithuanians that transfer of the territory in Suvalkija was not an urgent matter.[14] Eventually, Nazi Germany sold this territory to the Soviet Union for 7.5 million dollars on January 10, 1941, in the German–Soviet Border and Commercial Agreement.[19] Lithuanians in principle agreed to sign the mutual assistance treaty, but were instructed to resist Soviet bases as much as possible. Alternatives included doubling the Lithuanian army, exchanging military missions, and building fortifications on the western border with Germany similar to the Maginot Line in France.[16][20] On October 7, Lithuanian delegation, including General Stasys Raštikis and Deputy Prime Minister Kazys Bizauskas, returned to Moscow.[16] Stalin refused the proposed alternatives, but agreed to reduce the number of Soviet troops to 20,000 – about the size of the entire Lithuanian army.[9] Soviets wanted to sign the treaty right then to commemorate the 19th anniversary of Żeligowski's Mutiny and Lithuania's loss of Vilnius.[14] Political rallies, organized in Vilnius demanding city's incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, put additional pressure on Lithuanians and provided a sense of urgency.[9][14] Urbšys refused to sign and the talks receded for the second time.

In Lithuania, President Antanas Smetona doubted that it was worth gaining Vilnius for such a price and debated whether the negotiations could be broken off.[16] Bizauskas argued that refusing the treaty would not prevent the Soviet Union from implementing its plan. The Soviet Union had already threatened Estonia with force in the case it refused their mutual assistance treaty[2] and was gathering forces in Vilnius Region in the east and in Latvia in the north.[13] In such light, the government decided to demand as much territory as possible. However, when the delegation returned to Moscow, it found the atmosphere changed.[16] The Soviets were inflexible, refused further negotiations, and intimidated the delegation to sign the treaty. They presented a new draft, which combined the mutual assistance pact and transfer of Vilnius into one agreement.[16] The Lithuanian delegation had little choice but to sign the proposed treaty. After signing the treaty, Stalin invited the Lithuanian delegation to celebrate and watch two movies with him.[14] Urbšys informed the Lithuanian government about signing of the treaty only in the morning of October 11 – at the time the treaty was already published by Soviet news agency TASS.[21]

The mutual assistance treaty contained nine articles:[22]

The treaty also had a secret supplement, which specified that the Soviets could station only up to 20,000 of their troops.[23]

The treaty did not decide the exact location of the Soviet bases, and an 18-member Soviet delegation, led by Mikhail Kovalyov, was sent to Lithuania to discuss the specifics on October 22.[24] The Lithuanians sought to limit Soviet bases to Vilnius Region and southern Lithuania, offering Pabradė, Nemenčinė, Naujoji Vilnia, and Alytus.[25] They considered a base in Samogitia (western Lithuania) to be the worst possible outcome.[25] The Lithuanians preferred fewer, but bigger bases with no permanent runways for the aircraft. The Soviets initially proposed to have their bases in Vilnius, Kaunas, Alytus, Ukmergė, and Šiauliai.[25] The final agreement was signed on October 28, the same day when the Lithuanian army marched into Vilnius. A day before, another agreement determined the new border of eastern Lithuania: Lithuania received 6,739 km2 (2,602 sq mi) of territory with population of approximately 430,000.[16] The territory comprised about one fifth of the Vilnius Region recognized to Lithuania by the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of 1920; the population of Lithuania reached about 3.8 million.[26]

According to the final agreement, four military bases would be established in Lithuania with 18,786 military personnel from the 16th Special Rifle Corps, 5th Rifle Division, and 2nd Light Tank Brigade.[27] The bases were to be located in Alytus (infantry, artillery, and mechanized units with 8,000 troops), Prienai (infantry and artillery units with 2,500 soldiers), Gaižiūnai (mechanized and tank units with 3,500 troops), and in Naujoji Vilnia (headquarters, infantry and artillery units with 4,500 troops).[25] For comparison, on June 1, 1940, Lithuanian army had 22,265 soldiers and 1,728 officers.[28] While aircraft bases in Alytus and Gaižiūnai were under construction, Soviet aircraft were to be stationed in Kirtimai, [lt] a neighborhood of Vilnius.[25] The final location of the bases showed that the Soviets were more concerned with encircling Kaunas, the temporary capital, than with defending the country against a possible foreign attack.[25]

The treaty was presented as proof of Soviet respect for small nations[29] and Stalin's benevolence by Soviet propaganda.[1] Russians emphasized that it was the second time the Soviet Union gave Vilnius to Lithuania[21] while the League of Nations failed to mediate the Polish–Lithuanian dispute.[30] The Soviets also worked to assure Lithuanians that Soviet friendship is effective protection from and a welcome alternative to Nazi aggression.[14] The Polish government-in-exile officially protested the treaty as it did not recognize Russian conquest and claimed sovereignty over territories of the Second Polish Republic.[31] Lithuanians replied that the region was legally part of Lithuania.[32] Poles resented the transfer and as soon as the Soviet Army left Vilnius, anti-Lithuanian riots broke out accusing Lithuanians of betrayal.[33] France and Great Britain, traditional allies of Poland, also condemned the treaty.[14][16] Belarusian activists who campaigned for Vilnius incorporation into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic were arrested, deported, or executed by the Soviet authorities. The transfer upset their national aspirations to position Belarus as a successor to the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[32] Lithuanian relations with the Vatican were expected to improve as the cause for tension, the Vilnius Region assigned to Poland by the Concordat of 1925, now was under Lithuanian control.[34]

Lithuanian politicians attempted to show the regained Vilnius as a major diplomatic victory. The Lithuanian Nationalists Union, ruling political party in Lithuania since the 1926 coup, used celebrations of return of the city to increase its prestige and popularity.[23] The government stressed its competence and the opposition emphasized Soviet generosity.[30] While politicians publicly praised the Soviet Union and taunted ""traditional Soviet–Lithuanian friendship,"" in private they understood this treaty was a serious threat to Lithuanian independence.[23] Popular attitude was reflected in a known slogan ""Vilnius – mūsų, Lietuva – rusų"" (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's).[27] After the treaty was signed, Lithuania lost its neutrality and could not independently execute its foreign policy.[2][16] For example, Lithuania could not support Finland when the Winter War broke out after Finland rejected a similar mutual assistance treaty proposed by Soviet Union.[27] In international politics, Lithuania became a Soviet satellite.[23]

On October 28, the Lithuanian Army entered Vilnius for the first time since 1920. Before handing over the city to the Lithuanians, the Soviets robbed and transported to the Soviet Union all valuables: equipment from factories (including Elektrit) and hospitals, vehicles and trains, cultural objects from museums and libraries.[25] After the Russian troops left, Polish residents, seeing the deal as a betrayal of Poland, protested against the Lithuanian government.[33] On October 30 – November 1, when the bread price suddenly rose, clashes between local communists and Poles turned into a riot against the Jewish population.[35] Many Jewish shops were raided and some 35 people were injured.[36] Jews accused Lithuanian police of inaction and sympathizing with Polish rioters.[36] Soviet soldiers, uninvited by the Lithuanian government, helped to subdue the riots.[27]

The territory presented an economic challenge to Lithuania: unemployment was rampant, food was in short supply, valuables were stolen by the Soviet army, war refugees were gathering from other former Polish territories.[26] The Lithuanian army would provide up to 25,000 daily rations of hot soup and bread to residents of Vilnius. The Lithuanian government exchanged the Polish złoty to Lithuanian litas at a favourable rate, losing over 20 million litas.[26][37] The Lithuanian government decided to implement a land reform similar to the land reform executed in the 1920s.[37] Large estates would be nationalized and distributed to landless peasants in exchange for redemption dues payable in 36 years. Politicians hoped that such reform would weaken pro-Polish landowners and would win peasants' loyalty to the Lithuanian state. By March 1940, 90 estates and 23,000 hectares were distributed.[37] Lithuanians proceeded to ""re-Lithuanize"" cultural life in Vilnius Region. They closed many Polish cultural and educational institutions, including Stephan Batory University with over 3,000 students.[33] Lithuanians sought to introduce the Lithuanian language in public life and sponsored Lithuanian organizations and cultural activities.

Future of the Vilnius Region caused frictions between political and military leaders in Lithuania. As the first Soviet troops moved into Lithuania on November 14, the government, which included four generals, resigned.[38] A new civilian cabinet, led by controversial Prime Minister Antanas Merkys, was formed on November 21.[39] Lithuanians were careful to follow the treaty to the letter and not give any excuses for Moscow to accuse them of treaty violations.[26] At first, delayed by the Winter War,[13] the Soviets did not interfere with Lithuania's domestic affairs[11] and Soviet soldiers were well-behaved in their bases.[23] The Lithuanian government started debating its options and what could be done to prepare for the future occupation. Despite various resolutions, nothing material was accomplished.[26] Lithuania had no counterweight to Soviet influence: its own forces were small, Germany was in effect Russia's ally, Poland was conquered, France and Great Britain had bigger issues in western Europe.[16] After the Winter War was over, Soviet Union turned its attention to the Baltic States.[11]

After months of intense propaganda and diplomatic pressure, the Soviets issued an ultimatum on June 14, 1940 – the same day when the world's attention was focused on the fall of Paris during the Battle of France.[2] The Soviets accused Lithuania of violating the treaty and abducting Russian soldiers from their bases.[11] The Soviets demanded that a new government, which would comply with the Mutual Assistance Treaty, be formed and that an unspecified number of Soviet troops be admitted to Lithuania.[40] With Soviet troops already in the country it was impossible to mount military resistance.[2] The Soviets took control of government institutions, installed a new pro-Soviet government, and announced elections to the People's Seimas. The proclaimed Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the Soviet Union on August 3, 1940.[32]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet–Lithuanian_Mutual_Assistance_Treaty
Jewish poll tax,"The Jewish poll tax (Polish: pogłówne żydowskie) was a poll tax imposed on Jews in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was later absorbed into the hiberna tax.[1][2]

The Jews were exempt from other state and municipal taxes, which often caused protests from Polish city dwellers.[1]

Initially the collection of the tax was a duty of Jewish Councils (Council of Four Lands, Council of the Land of Lithuania). Sometimes it was paid to the royal treasury, other times it was paid directly to the military units funded from this tax.[2]

The Jewish councils divide the tax into smaller internal divisions called ""portions"" (Hebrew: skhumot, Polish: sympla).[1][2] The sum of the portions was always larger than the state-imposed amount, and the council used the surplus for the needs of Jewish community and the council apparatus. This practice was common for non-Jewish taxes as well, and the Crown was aware of it.[1]

By early 17th century, the duty of Jewish poll tax was transferred to sejmiks, and it was later transferred to the Polish military; by mid-17th century, it was absorbed into the hiberna.[1]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_poll_tax
History of Polish intelligence services,"This article covers the history of Polish Intelligence services dating back to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Though the first official Polish government service entrusted with espionage, intelligence and counter-intelligence was not formed until 1918, Kingdom of Poland and later the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had developed networks of informants in neighbouring countries. Envoys and ambassadors had also gathered intelligence, often using bribery. Such agents included the 17th-century Polish poet Jan Andrzej Morsztyn.

Polish kings and Polish–Lithuanian military commanders (hetmans) such as Stanisław Koniecpolski maintained intelligence networks. The hetmans were responsible for intelligence-gathering in the Ottoman Empire, its vassal states and disputed territories such as Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania. Intelligence networks also operated in Muscovy and among the restless Cossacks.

In 1683, during the Battle of Vienna, the Polish merchant-spy Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki secured a promise of military assistance for Vienna, besieged by the Turkish forces of Kara Mustafa Pasha, and thus facilitated the victory of a Christian European coalition led by Polish King Jan III Sobieski. Kulczycki is reported to have received a reward for his services: the Turks' supplies of coffee beans and establishment of Vienna's first coffee house.

During the period when Poland had been partitioned (beginning in 1772, until 1918) by three adjacent empires, intelligence played an important role in patriotic Poles' surveillance of their occupiers and in their planning and conduct of successive Polish uprisings.

In 1914, Józef Piłsudski created the Polish Military Organization, an intelligence and special-operations organization which worked alongside the Polish Legions. As such, it was independent of Austro-Hungary and loyal to Piłsudski and to a future independent Poland.

Immediately upon achieving independence in 1918, Poland established armed forces. Reflecting the influence of the French Military Mission to Poland, the Polish General Staff was divided into divisions entrusted with specific tasks:

Division II (colloquially, ""Dwójka,"" ""Two"") was formed in October 1918, even before Poland had declared her independence. Initially called the ""General Staff Information Department,"" Division II was divided into sections (sekcje):

An extensive network of domestic and foreign informants developed rapidly. This was due to Poland's poor economic situation, itself the result of over a century of foreign occupation. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Poland's economic and political situation had forced hundreds of thousands to emigrate. With the advent of Polish independence, many émigrés offered their services to Polish intelligence agencies. Other Poles who had been living in the former Russian Empire and were now making their way home through war-torn Russia, provided priceless intelligence on the logistics, order of battle and status of the parties in the Russian Civil War.

In Western Europe (especially in Germany, France and Belgium) the Polish diaspora often formed the backbone of heavy industry; some one million people of Polish descent lived in the Ruhr Valley alone. Many of these provided intelligence on industrial production and economic conditions.

After the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War in early 1919, intelligence from the east proved vital to Poland's survival against a far superior enemy. A separate organization was formed within Polish Intelligence, taking over most intelligence duties for the duration of the war. This was a Biuro Wywiadowcze (Intelligence Bureau) comprising seven departments:

The fourth department, Offensive Intelligence ""C"", became the most developed because it carried out all the duties connected with ""front-line"" reconnaissance and intelligence, as well as ""long-range"" intelligence and surveillance in countries surrounding Bolshevik Russia, including Siberia (still in the hands of the White Russians), Turkey, Persia, China, Mongolia and Japan.

The third department, Offensive Intelligence ""B,"" controlled an intelligence network in European Russia.

Additional intelligence was obtained from Russian defectors and prisoners of war who crossed the Polish lines in their thousands, especially after the 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

After the Polish–Soviet War and the Treaty of Riga, Polish Intelligence had to restructure to cope with new challenges. Though Poland had won most of her border conflicts (most notably the war with Russia and the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918–19 against Germany), her international situation was unenviable. By mid-1921, Section II had been restructured into three main departments, each overseeing a number of offices:

Until the late 1930s the Soviet Union was seen as the most likely aggressor and Poland's main adversary. Section II developed an extensive network of agents within Poland's eastern neighbor and other adjoining countries. In the early 1920s Polish intelligence began developing a network for ""offensive intelligence."" The Eastern Office (Referat ""Wschód"") had several dozen bureaus, mostly attached to Polish consulates in Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Kharkov and Tbilisi.

Short-range reconnaissance was carried out by the Border Defense Corps, created in 1924. On a number of occasions, soldiers crossed the border disguised as smugglers, partisans or bandits. They gathered information on the disposition of Soviet troops and the morale of the Soviet populace. At the same time, Soviet forces carried out analogous missions on Polish soil. The situation finally stabilized in 1925; however, such missions continued to occur occasionally.

Polish Intelligence produced fairly accurate pictures of the capabilities of Poland's main potential adversaries—Germany and the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, this information was of little avail when war came in September 1939. Good intelligence could not offset the overwhelming superiority of the German and Soviet armed forces. The conquest of Poland took four weeks—too short a time for intelligence services to make a significant contribution. With Poland conquered, her intelligence services had to evacuate their headquarters to allied French and British territories.

Until 1939 Polish intelligence services did not, as a rule, collaborate with the intelligence services of other countries with the exception of Imperial Japan. A partial exception was also France, Poland's closest ally; even then cooperation was lukewarm, with neither side sharing their most precious secrets. An important exception was the long-term collaboration between France's Gustave Bertrand and Poland's Cipher Bureau, headed by Gwido Langer. The situation only began to change in 1939, when war appeared certain and Britain and France entered into a formal military alliance with Poland. The most important result of the subsequent information-sharing was the disclosure to France and Britain of Polish techniques and equipment for breaking German Enigma machine ciphers.

The initial break into the Enigma ciphers had been made in late 1932 by mathematician Marian Rejewski, working for the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau. His work was facilitated, perhaps decisively, by intelligence provided by Bertrand. With the help of fellow mathematicians Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Różycki, Rejewski developed techniques to decrypt German Enigma-enciphered messages on a regular and timely basis.

Six-and-a-half years after the initial Polish decryption of Enigma ciphers, French and British intelligence representatives were briefed on Polish achievements at a trilateral conference held at Cipher Bureau facilities in the Kabaty Woods, just south of Warsaw, on July 26, 1939, barely five weeks before the outbreak of World War II. This formed the basis for early Enigma decryption by the British at Bletchley Park, northwest of London. Without the head start provided by Poland, British reading of Enigma encryptions might have been delayed several years, if it would have gotten off the ground at all.

Key Polish Cipher Bureau personnel escaped from Poland on September 17, 1939, on the Soviet Union's entry into eastern Poland, and eventually reached France. There, at ""PC Bruno"" outside Paris, they resumed cracking Enigma ciphers through the ""Phony War"" (October 1939 – May 1940). Following the fall of northern France to the Germans, the Polish-French-Spanish cryptological organization, sponsored by French Major Gustave Bertrand, continued its work at ""Cadix"" in the Vichy ""Free Zone"" until it was occupied by German forces in November 1942.

After the 1939 invasion of Poland, practically all of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence) command apparatus managed to escape to Romania and soon reached France and Britain. Reactivating agent networks throughout Europe, they immediately began cooperating with French and British intelligence agencies. After the subsequent fall of France, most of Section II ended up in Britain.

At that time Britain was in a difficult situation, badly in need of intelligence from occupied Europe after rapid German advances had disrupted its networks and put German forces into areas where Britain had few agents. Following the personal intervention of Churchill and Sikorski in September 1940, cooperation between British and Polish intelligence organizations entered a new phase.

The Poles placed their Section II at the disposal of the British, but as a quid pro quo requested and obtained (at that time without any reservations) the right to use, without British oversight, their own ciphers which they had developed in France. The Poles were the only Allied country that was given this unique status, though as the war progressed it was challenged by some agencies of the British government. Due to support from members of the British Special Operations Executive, the Poles kept their ciphers to the end of hostilities.[1]

In the first half of 1941 Polish agents in France supplied Britain with intelligence on U-boat movements from French Atlantic ports. The Polish network in France grew to 1,500 members and, before and during Operation Overlord, supplied vital information about the German military in France. Agents working in Poland in the spring of 1941 supplied extensive intelligence about German preparations to invade the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa).

Agency Africa was set up in July 1941 in Algiers by Mieczyslaw Zygfryd Slowikowski, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki; using the codename ""Rygor"" (Polish for ""Rigor""). Their information was used by the Americans and British to plan the amphibious Operation Torch landings in North Africa in November 1942, the first large-scale Allied landings of the war.

Polish spies also documented German atrocities being perpetrated at Auschwitz (Witold Pilecki's report) and elsewhere in Poland against Jewish and non-Jewish populations. Polish intelligence gave the British crucial information on Germany's secret-weapons projects, including the V-1 and V-2 rockets, enabling Britain to set back these German programs by bombing the main development facility at Peenemünde in 1943. Poland's networks supplied the western Allies with intelligence on nearly all aspects of the German war effort. Of 45,770 reports received by British intelligence during the war, nearly half (22,047) came from Polish agents.

By early 1944, western Allied intelligence policy shifted towards strengthening links with the Japanese, Swedes, Hungarian and Finnish intelligence services. Of these, Poland had existing to the Japanese from before the war.[2] The SOE planted Polish agents disguised as British Liaison Officers in operations Desford and Windproof to strengthen intelligence gathering and coordinate with Hungarian and Slovak groups in spite of the imminent Soviet occupation.

On March 15, 1946, Section II was officially disbanded, and its archives were taken over by Britain. At Section II's dissolution, it had 170 officers and 3,500 agents, excluding headquarters staff. Very likely at least some of the Polish agents continued working directly for Britain during the Cold War.

The Polish intelligence contribution to Britain's war effort was kept secret due to Cold War exigencies. In later years, as official British histories were released, the Polish intelligence role barely rated a mention. Only when British wartime decryption of Enigma ciphers was made public in the 1970s, did a Polish contribution begin to become known; even then, however, the early versions published in Britain (and some versions even to the end of the 20th century) claimed that Polish intelligence had only been able to steal a German Enigma machine. The truth, which had previously been disclosed in Bertrand's book and would later be detailed in papers by Marian Rejewski (who had survived the war and lived to 1980), made slow headway against British and American obfuscations, mendacities and fabrications.[3] The Polish Enigma-breaking effort had been much more sophisticated than those English-language accounts made out, and had in fact relied largely on mathematical analysis. Historians' efforts to gain access to documentation of other Polish intelligence operations met with British stonewalling and with claims that the pertinent Polish archives had been destroyed by the British.

Polish intelligence supplied valuable intelligence to the Allies; 48% of all reports received by the British secret services from continental Europe in between 1939 and 1945 came from Polish sources.[4] The total number of those reports is estimated about bout 80,000, and 85% of them were deemed high or better quality.[5] Despite Poland becoming occupied, the Polish intelligence network not only survived but grew rapidly, and near the end of the war had over 1,600 registered agents.[4]

Western Allies had limited intelligence assets in Central and Eastern Europe, and extensive Polish intelligence network in place proved to be a major asset, even described as ""the only allied intelligence assets on the Continent"" following the French capitulation.[6][7][4] According to Marek Ney-Krwawicz [pl], for the Western Allies, the intelligence provided by the Home Army was considered to be the best source of information on the Eastern Front.[8]

The secret service of the Polish Home Army also collaborated extensively with Japan[9] during WW2, sharing information on both the Nazis and the Soviet Union, and receiving both funds and equipment from Japan. Weapons, ammo and medical supplies were smuggled into occupied Poland from Japan, through neutral nations, using Japanese diplomatic offices along the way. Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat in Lithuania, exchanged information with members of the Polish resistance and issued them Japanese transit visas in 1940.[10]

There was also an Estezet network based out of New York City from 1941 during WWII.

On occupying Poland and installing a puppet government, the Soviet Union created new Polish intelligence and internal-security agencies. The Soviet special services had begun training Polish officers as early as 1943. That year, some 120 Poles had begun training at an NKVD school in Kuybyshev (now Samara). At the same time, in NKVD-NKGB schools all over the USSR, hundreds of Germans, Romanians, Czechoslovaks and Bulgarians had also undergone the same training in order to prepare them for work in future special services in their respective countries.

In July 1944 in Moscow the temporary Polish puppet government was established by the name of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego), or PKWN. The PKWN was organized as thirteen departments (resorty). One of them was the Department of Public Security (Resort Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego), or RBP, headed by long-time Polish communist Stanisław Radkiewicz. The largest and the most important department in the RBP, Department 1, was responsible for counter-espionage and headed by Roman Romkowski. By September 1945 Department 1 had become so large that three additional departments were created, as well as two separate sections. By the close of 1944, the Department of Public Security totaled 3000 employees.

On December 31, 1944, the PKWN was joined by several members of the Polish government in exile, among them Stanisław Mikołajczyk. It was then transformed into the Provisional Government of Republic of Poland (Rząd Tymczasowy Republiki Polskiej, or RTRP), and the departments were renamed as ministries.

The Ministry of Public Security was responsible for both intelligence and counter-espionage, as well as surveillance of citizens and suppression of dissent. They generally did not employ former officers of the ""Dwojka"" or follow the traditions of pre-war Polish intelligence services. Personnel were recruited for their ""political reliability"". New formations were trained by Soviet NKVD experts. Additionally, and especially in the early years (1945–49), Soviet officers in Polish uniforms overlooked their operations. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953 and the later defection of Col. Józef Światło, the Ministry of Public Security was cancelled and replaced by two separate administrations - the Committee for Public Security (Polish: Komitet do Spraw Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego, or Kds.BP) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

The Kds.BP was responsible for intelligence and government protection and. From September 3, 1955, to 28 November 1956, the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (Główny Zarząd Informacji Wojska Polskiego), which was responsible for the military police and counter-espionage agency, was also controlled by the Kds.BP. The MSW was responsible for the supervision of local governments, Militsiya, correctional facilities, fire rescue and the border and internal guards.

The next big changes came in 1956. The Committee for Public Security was abolished and the Ministry of Internal Affairs took over their responsibilities. The MSW assumed control of the political police, under the Służba Bezpieczeństwa.

From 1956 to the fall of communism in Poland the MSW was one of the biggest and strongest administrations. During this period its responsibilities included intelligence, counter-espionage, anti-state activity (SB), government protection, confidential communications, supervision of the local governments, Milicja Obywatelska, correctional facilities, and fire rescue. The Ministry of Internal Affairs was divided into departments. The most important of these were the first second and third departments. The first dealt with foreign operations and intelligence gathering, the second with spy activities both by Poland and other countries and the third was responsible for anti-state activities and the protection of the country's secrets.

With the exception of its own departments and sections, the MSW also had control over the Milicja Obywatelska (Komenda Główna Milicji Obywatelskiej or KG/MO), fire rescue (Komenda Główna Straży Pożarnych or KG/SP), territorial anti-aircraft defense, (Komenda Główna Terenowej Obrony Przeciwlotniczej KG/TOP), management of geodesy and cartography, (Główny Zarząd Geodezji i Kartografii) and health services (Centralny Zarząd Służby Zdrowia). Ministry of Internal Affairs also had control over the command of the Internal Security Corps. (Dowództwo Korpusu Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego or KBW), command of the Border Protection Forces, and management of Information of Internal Troops (Zarząd Informacji Wojsk Wewnetrznych). Through the 1980s the MSW had 24,390 staff in Security Services, 62,276 in the Citizen's Militsiya, 12,566 in Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia (Zmotoryzowane Odwody Milicji Obywatelskiej, or ZOMO), 20,673 in Administratively-Economic Units (Jednostki administracyjno-gospodarcze) and 4,594 in ministry schools, not including students.

The first military special services in Poland after World War II were created in 1943 as part of the Polish military in the USSR. First organ that dealt with military counterespionage was called Directorate of Information by the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army (Zarząd Informacji Naczelnego Dowódcy Wojska Polskiego, or ZI NDWP). On November 30, 1944, the commander-in-chief of the Polish Army, general Michał Rola-Żymierski, transformed the ZI NDWP into the Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army (Główny Zarząd Informacji Wojska Polskiego, or GZI WP) in his 95th order. From 30 November 1950, the GZI WP became the Main Directorate of Information of the Ministry of Defense (Główny Zarząd Informacji Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, or GZI MON). In September 1955 GZI MON became part of the Committee for Public Security, which was the successor of Ministerstwo Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego, more commonly known as the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa or UB, and the name was changed to the Main Directorate of Information of the Committee for Public Security, or GZI KdsBP. In November 1956 the GZI Kds.BP separated from the Committee for Public Security, and returned to its previous role, becoming again the Main Directorate of Information of the Ministry of Defense. After the reform instituted by Władysław Gomułka in 1956, and the role the GZI played in repressions and executions, the Main Directorate of Information of Ministry of Defense was cancelled in 1957 and replaced by the Military Internal Service (Wojskowa Służba Wewnętrzna, or WSW). The WSW continuously operated as the main military police and counterespionage service until the fall of communism in Poland.

The first Polish Military Intelligence after World War II was the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army (Oddział II Sztabu Generalnego Ludowego Wojska Polskiego, or Odział II Szt Gen LWP) and bore the same name as its precursor from before the war. Odział II Szt Gen WP was established on July 18, 1945, but its origins can be traced to May 1943, when the first reconnaissance company was created in Polish Army units in the USSR. Between July 1947 and June 5, 1950, the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army operated within the structure of the Ministry of Public Security together with the civilian intelligence branch as Department VII. On June 5, 1950, it returned to the Ministry of Defense. The first head of Odział II Szt Gen WP was Colonel Gieorgij Domeradzki. In November 1945 this position was occupied by General Wacław Komar, and between October 1950 and March 1951 by soviet officer Konstantin Kahnikov. The last commander of the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army was Igor Suchacki.

On November 15, 1951, Polish Defence Minister Konstantin Rokossovsky (in his 88th order) transformed the Second Section of General Staff of the Polish People's Army to Second Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army (Zarząd II Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego). Internal organization was transformed from sections to directorates and intelligence work among the United States, Great Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria was expanded to countries such as Norway, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey and Israel. In 1990 the Second Directorate of General Staff of the Polish Army was join with the Military Internal Service (Wojskowa Służba Wewnętrzna, or WSW), in order to have intelligence and counter-intelligence working under one structure as the Second Directorate for Intelligence and Counter-intelligence (Zarząd II Wywiadu i Kontrwywiadu). In 1991 the Second Directorate for Intelligence and Counter-intelligence was transformed into Military Information Services (Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne, or WSI), and continues to function under this name.

After the changes of 1989 the Służba Bezpieczeństwa was disbanded by the first free government under the prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. A new agency, called the State Protection Office (Urząd Ochrony Państwa, or UOP) was formed and staffed mainly by the former SB officers who successfully passed a verification procedure. Its mission was primarily general espionage and intelligence gathering as well as counter-espionage and fighting against high ranked organized crime. It was commanded by a career intelligence officer but was directly supervised by a civilian government official, Coordinator for the Special Services.

Most of the time the agency evaded public attention, although it was dragged into political fighting over appointments of its chiefs, lustration and some perceived failures with organized crime cases. In 2002 the new, post-communist left-wing government reorganized the special services by dividing them into two agencies; the Internal Security Agency (Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) and Intelligence Agency (Agencja Wywiadu). The move was widely perceived as a way of cleansing the higher ranks of the officers appointed by previous right-wing governments.

The military intelligence continued to function under a slightly altered name (Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne- Military Information Services) and without much organizational change; at least none that was visible to the general public. The new Polish conservative government declared dissolution of the WSI and creating new services in October 2005, since the agency skipped serious external reforms after the collapse of communism in 1989. Throughout the transformation the WSI were allegedly involved in dubious operations, arms sales to UN-sanctioned states and corruption scandals. In 2006, the WSI was split into Służba Kontrwywiadu Wojskowego and Służba Wywiadu Wojskowego.[11]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Polish_intelligence_services
Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Hebrew: קיצור תולדות האנושות, Qitzur Toldot ha-Enoshut) is a book by Yuval Noah Harari, based on a series of lectures he taught at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It was first published in Hebrew in Israel in 2011, and in English in 2014.[1][2] The book focuses on Homo sapiens, and surveys the history of humankind, starting from the Stone Age and going up to the 21st century. The account is situated within a framework that intersects the natural sciences with the social sciences.

Harari's work places human history within a framework, with the natural sciences setting limits for human activity and social sciences shaping what happens within those bounds. The academic discipline of history is the account of cultural change.

Harari surveys the history of humankind from the Stone Age up to the 21st century, focusing on Homo sapiens. He divides the history of H. sapiens into four major parts:[3]

Harari's main argument is that H. sapiens came to dominate the world because they are the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers. He argues that prehistoric H. sapiens were a key cause of the extinction of other human species such as the Neanderthals and numerous other megafauna. He further argues that the ability of H. sapiens to cooperate in large numbers arises from its unique capacity to believe in things existing purely in the imagination, such as gods, nations, money and human rights. He argues that these beliefs give rise to discrimination – whether racial, sexual or political – and it is potentially impossible to have a completely unbiased society. Harari claims that all large-scale human cooperation systems – including religions, political structures, trade networks and legal institutions – owe their emergence to H. sapiens' distinctive cognitive capacity for fiction.[4] Accordingly, Harari describes money as a system of mutual trust and political and economic systems as similar to religions.

Harari's key claim regarding the Agricultural Revolution is that while it promoted population growth for H. sapiens and co-evolving species like wheat and cows, it made the lives of most individuals (and animals) worse than they had been when H. sapiens were mostly hunter-gatherers, since their diet and daily lives became significantly less varied. Humans' violent treatment of other animals is a theme that runs throughout the book.

In discussing the unification of humankind, Harari argues that over its history, the trend for H. sapiens has increasingly been towards political and economic interdependence. For centuries, the majority of humans lived in empires, and capitalist globalization is effectively producing one, global empire. Harari argues that money, empires, and universal religions are the principal drivers of this process.

Harari describes the Scientific Revolution as an innovation in European thought, whereby elites became willing to admit to and try to remedy their own ignorance. He describes this as one driver of early modern European imperialism and of the current convergence of human cultures. Harari also claims there is a lack of research into the history of happiness, positing that people today are not significantly happier than in past eras.[5] He concludes by discussing how modern technology may soon end the species by ushering in genetic engineering, immortality, and non-organic life. Harari metaphorically describes humans as deities in that they can create species.

Harari cites Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997) as one of the greatest inspirations for the book.[6]

First published in Hebrew in 2011, the book was later released in English in 2015 and has since been translated into 65 different languages.[7] It made The New York Times best-seller list, appearing for 182 weeks (as of May 2022) including 96 consecutive weeks.[8][9] According to Book Marks, the book received ""positive"" reviews based on 9 critic reviews with 1 being ""rave"" and 5 being ""positive"" and 3 being ""mixed"".[10] The Bookseller reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of ""Top form"", ""Flawed but worth a read"", and ""Disappointing"": Sunday Times and Times reviews under ""Top form"".[11] It won the National Library of China's Wenjin Book Award for the best book published in 2014.[12][13] Writing four years after its English-language publication, Alex Preston wrote in The Guardian that Sapiens had become a ""publishing phenomenon"" with ""wild success"" symptomatic of a broader trend toward ""intelligent, challenging nonfiction, often books that are several years old"".[14] Concurrently, The Guardian listed the book as among the ten ""best brainy books of the decade"".[15] The Royal Society of Biologists in the UK shortlisted the book in its 2015 Book Awards.[16] Bill Gates ranked Sapiens among his ten favorite books,[17] and Mark Zuckerberg also recommended it.[18] Kirkus Reviews awarded a star to the book, noting that it is ""the great debates of history aired out with satisfying vigor"".[19] The British daily The Times also gave the book a rave review, quoting that ""Sapiens is the kind of book that sweeps cobwebs out of your brain"" and that it is ""mind-thrilling"".[20] The Sydney Morning Herald described the book as ""always engaging and often provocative"".[21]

In 2015 the Israel Museum in Jerusalem created a special, temporary exhibit based on the book, using archeological and artistic displays to demonstrate the main themes found in the book. The exhibit ran from May until December 2015.[22]

Discussing the book's success in 2020, Ian Parker writing for The New Yorker said ""the book thrived in an environment of relative critical neglect"" since it received few major reviews at the time of its release. Parker describes Sapiens' extremely broad scope as being a defense against expert criticism. Quoting Harari's academic advisor Steven Gunn, ""Nobody's an expert on the meaning of everything, or the history of everybody, over a long period.""[23] In a 2022 article titled ""The Dangerous Populist Science of Yuval Noah Harari"" for Current Affairs, neuroscientist Darshana Narayanan expanded on The New Yorker's comments: ""I tried my hand at fact-checking Sapiens ... I consulted colleagues in the neuroscience and evolutionary biology community and found that Harari's errors are numerous and substantial, and cannot be dismissed as nit-picking.""[24]

Anthropologist Christopher Robert Hallpike reviewed the book and did not find any ""serious contribution to knowledge"". Hallpike suggested that ""...whenever his facts are broadly correct they are not new, and whenever he tries to strike out on his own he often gets things wrong, sometimes seriously"". He considered it an infotainment publishing event offering a ""wild intellectual ride across the landscape of history, dotted with sensational displays of speculation, and ending with blood-curdling predictions about human destiny.""[25]

Science journalist Charles C. Mann concluded in The Wall Street Journal, ""There's a whiff of dorm-room bull sessions about the author's stimulating but often unsourced assertions.""[26]

Reviewing the book in The Washington Post, evolutionary anthropologist Avi Tuschman points out problems stemming from the contradiction between Harari's ""freethinking scientific mind"" and his ""fuzzier worldview hobbled by political correctness"", but nonetheless wrote that ""Harari's book is important reading for serious-minded, self-reflective sapiens.""[27]

Reviewing the book in The Guardian, philosopher Galen Strawson concluded that, among several other problems, ""Much of Sapiens is extremely interesting, and it is often well expressed. As one reads on, however, the attractive features of the book are overwhelmed by carelessness, exaggeration and sensationalism"". He specifically mentions how the author ignores happiness studies, that his claims of the ""opening of a gap between the tenets of liberal humanism and the latest findings of the life sciences"" is silly and deplores that the author ""transforms Adam Smith into the apostle of greed"".[28]

The original Hebrew publication was first issued in 2011 as קיצור תולדות האנושות [Ḳitsur toldot ha-enoshut], which translates into A Brief History of Humankind.

A 2012 English translation was self-published with the title From Animals Into Gods. The English translation was published in 2015 as Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, ""translated by the author with the help of John Purcell and Haim Watzman"", simultaneously in London by Harvill Secker ISBN 978-1846558238 (hardback), ISBN 978-1846558245 (trade paperback)[29] and in Canada by Signal (ISBN 978-0-7710-3850-1 (bound), ISBN 978-0-7710-3852-5 (html)). It was then republished in London by Vintage Books in 2015 (ISBN 978-0099590088 (paperback)).

In 2020 the first volume of the graphic novel version of the book was published simultaneously in several languages, with the title Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 1: The Birth of Humankind. It is credited as coauthored by Harari and David Vandermeulen, with adaptation and illustrations by Daniel Casanave. The second volume Sapiens: A Graphic History, Volume 2: The Pillars of Civilization was published in October 2021.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind
Aušra,"Aušra or Auszra (literally: dawn) was the first national Lithuanian newspaper. The first issue was published in 1883, in Ragnit, East Prussia, Germany   (newspaper credited it as Lithuanian: Ragainė) East Prussia's ethnolinguistic part - Lithuania Minor. Later it was published monthly in Tilsit (present-day Sovetsk). Even though only forty issues were published and the circulation did not exceed 1,000, it was a significant event as it marked the beginnings of the Lithuanian national rebirth that eventually resulted in an independent Lithuanian State (1918–1940). This period, between 1883 and 1904, when the Lithuanian press ban was enforced by Tsarist authorities, has been referred to as the Aušros gadynė (the Dawn Period). The printing ceased in 1886 as a result of financial issues.

After the Russian authorities denied permission to publish a Lithuanian newspaper in Vilnius, Jonas Šliūpas proposed to publish it in East Prussia, Germany. However, he was perceived as too radical, and Jurgis Mikšas, the printer, invited Jonas Basanavičius to become its first editor. During its three years of existence, Aušra had a total of five editors. After Mikšas had to resign for personal reasons, Šliūpas was entrusted to oversee future publications. However, he ran into conflicts with Basanavičius, who was living in Bulgaria. Šliūpas also had issues with the German authorities due to his involvement in nationalistic movements and had to leave Prussia in 1884. The other editors, Martynas Jankus and Jonas Andziulaitis, did not engage in polemic writing and the controversies calmed down. Soon Mikšas ran into debt and could no longer support the newspaper. The printing was discontinued.

After Aušra was discontinued, new Lithuanian-language periodicals appeared. Varpas (literally: The Bell) was a secular newspaper, while Šviesa was more conservative and was a religiously oriented publication.

The newspaper was published outside Lithuania proper because of the Lithuanian press ban that had been enforced by the authorities of the Russian Empire since the Uprising in 1863. It was prohibited to publish anything in the Lithuanian language using the Latin alphabet; the government wished to force the people to use Grazhdanka, a Cyrillic alphabet. Printing in the Latin alphabet was organized abroad, mostly in Lithuania Minor; knygnešiai (literally: book smugglers) would carry the printed materials across the German-Russian border. This was one of the ways Aušra would reach its readers. The other way was in sealed envelopes.

More than 70 people contributed to Aušra. The writers, or Aušrininkai, came from families of well-to-do peasants that started to appear after serfdom was abolished in 1863. Most of the authors received education in the Russian universities and were fluent in Polish. Because of frequent changes in editorial staff, the newspaper did not have a clear and well-defined agenda. Basanavičius did not envision Aušra as a political publication; in the first issue he declared that the newspaper would deal only with cultural matters. However, Aušra soon took on a nationalistic agenda. Aušra helped to crystallize many ideas about the Lithuanian nation and the definition of a Lithuanian. It started to reject the ideas of resurrecting the old Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The authors started to think about an independent Lithuanian nation-state.

It published on many different subjects like agriculture or reports from Lithuanian communities in the United States, but history was the most popular. The foreword of the first issue began with a Latin proverb, Homines historiarum ignari semper sunt pueri, or People ignoring history remain children forever. They built upon the works of Simonas Daukantas, the first historian, who wrote history of Lithuania in Lithuanian and painted an idealized image of the mighty Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Aušra was critical regarding the forceful Polonisation executed by the Polish clergy and Tsarist Russification. One of the main aims of Aušra editors was to gain the usage rights to Lithuanian language and to revive its prestige.

The newspaper was directed at the intelligentsia and therefore limited its readership. The peasants did not appreciate that Aušra was secular and did not embrace Catholic traditions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aušra
History of NATO,"The history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) begins in the immediate aftermath of World War II. In 1947, the United Kingdom and France signed the Treaty of Dunkirk and the United States set out the Truman Doctrine, the former to defend against a potential German attack and the latter to counter Soviet expansion. The Treaty of Dunkirk was expanded in 1948 with the Treaty of Brussels to add the three Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) and committed them to collective defense against an armed attack for fifty years. The Truman Doctrine expanded in the same year, with support being pledged to oppose the communist rebellions in Greece and Czechoslovakia, as well as Soviet demands from Turkey. In 1949, the NATO defensive pact was signed by twelve countries on both sides of the North Atlantic – the five Brussels signatories, the United States, Canada, Italy, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland.[1] Greece and Turkey joined in 1952, West Germany joined in 1955, Spain joined in 1982, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland joined in 1999, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined in 2004, Albania and Croatia joined in 2009, Montenegro joined in 2017, North Macedonia joined in 2020, Finland joined in 2023, and Sweden joined in 2024.

The structure of NATO evolved throughout the Cold War and its aftermath. The first headquarters were located at 13, Belgrave Square, London (1948-51), before moving to a more suitable space in Paris in April 1952.  An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 as it became clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, Allied Command Europe and its headquarters (SHAPE) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.[2]

From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders were the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT).

NATO has its roots in the Atlantic Charter, a 1941 agreement between the United States and United Kingdom.  The Charter laid out a framework for international cooperation without territorial expansion after World War II.[3]

The Treaty of Brussels was a mutual defense treaty against the Soviet threat at the start of the Cold War. It was signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom and was the precursor to NATO. The Soviet threat became immediate with the Berlin Blockade in 1948, leading to the creation of a multinational defense organization, the Western Union Defence Organisation, in September 1948.[4] However, the parties were too weak militarily to counter the Soviet Armed Forces. In addition, the communist 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état had overthrown a democratic government, and British Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin reiterated that the best way to prevent another Czechoslovakia was to evolve a joint Western military strategy. He got a receptive hearing in the United States, especially with the American anxiety over Italy and the Italian Communist Party.[5]

In 1948, European leaders met with US defense, military, and diplomatic officials at the Pentagon, exploring a framework for a new and unprecedented association.[1] The talks resulted in the North Atlantic Treaty, and the United States signed on 4 April 1949. Participants included the five Treaty of Brussels states, as well as the United States, Canada, Portugal, Italy, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.[6] The first  NATO Secretary General, Lord Ismay, stated in 1949 that the organization's goal was ""to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down"".[7] Popular support for the treaty was not unanimous, and some Icelanders participated in a  pro-neutrality, anti-membership riot in March 1949. The formation of NATO can be seen as the primary institutional consequence of a school of thought called Atlanticism, which stressed the importance of trans-Atlantic cooperation.[8]

The members agreed that an armed attack against any of them in Europe or North America would be considered an attack against them all. Consequently, they agreed that if an armed attack occurred, each of them, in the exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense, would assist the member being attacked and take such action as it deemed necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. The treaty does not require members to respond with military action against an aggressor. Although obliged to respond, they maintain the freedom to choose the method by which they do so. That differs from Article IV of the Treaty of Brussels, which clearly states that the response is military in nature. NATO members are nonetheless assumed to aid the attacked member militarily. The treaty was later clarified to include both the members' territory and their ""vessels, forces or aircraft"" north of the Tropic of Cancer, including some overseas departments of France.[9]

The creation of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which, in many cases, meant European countries adopting US practices. Roughly 1300 Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Thus many NATO countries introduced the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge in the 1950s as a standard firearm-cartridge.[10] Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's  FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside NATO.[11] Also, aircraft-marshaling signals were standardized so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO Stock Number became widespread, and the NATO phonetic alphabet extends beyond NATO into civilian use.[12]

The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 proved crucial for NATO, as it raised the apparent threat of all Communist countries working together and forced the alliance to develop concrete military plans.[13] NATO set up the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) to direct forces in Europe; it began work under  Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower in January 1951.[14] In September 1950, the NATO Military Committee called for an ambitious buildup of conventional forces to meet the Soviets and reaffirmed that position at the February 1952 meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Lisbon. The conference, seeking to provide the forces necessary for NATO's Long-Term Defence Plan, called for an expansion to 96  divisions. However, that requirement dropped the following year to roughly 35 divisions, with heavier use to be made of nuclear weapons. At this time, NATO could call on about 15 ready divisions in Central Europe and on another 10 in Italy and Scandinavia.[15][16] Also at Lisbon, the post of Secretary General of NATO as the organization's chief civilian was created, and eventually the North Atlantic Council appointed Lord Ismay to the post.[17]

In September 1952, the first major NATO  maritime exercises began. Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway.[18] Other major exercises that followed included: Exercise Grand Slam and Exercise Longstep, naval and amphibious exercises in the Mediterranean Sea; Italic Weld, a combined air-naval-ground exercise in northern Italy; Grand Repulse, involving the British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), the Netherlands Corps and Allied Air Forces Central Europe (AAFCE); Monte Carlo, a simulated atomic air-ground exercise involving the Central Army Group; and Weldfast, a combined amphibious landing exercise in the Mediterranean Sea involving American, British, Greek, Italian, and Turkish naval forces.[19]

Greece and Turkey joined the alliance in 1952, which forced a series of controversial negotiations, mainly between United States and Britain, over how to bring both countries into the military command-structure.[14] While that overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after an expected Soviet invasion - including Operation Gladio - were transferred to NATO control. Ultimately, unofficial bonds began to grow between the respective armed forces of NATO member-states. Such links included the NATO Tiger Association (established in 1961) and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery,[20][21] instituted in 1963.

In 1954, the Soviet Union suggested that it might join NATO to preserve peace in Europe.[22][23] The NATO countries, fearing that the Soviet Union's motive was to weaken the alliance, ultimately[when?] rejected that proposal. On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council approved MC 48, a key document in the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO had to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union, whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. That gave  SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons that existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.

The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as ""a decisive turning point in the history of our continent"" by Halvard Lange, then the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister.[24] The alliance saw German manpower as necessary to have enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion.[25] One of the immediate results of West German entry was the creation of the Warsaw Pact, which was signed on 14 May 1955 by the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, and East Germany, thereby delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War in Europe.

Three major NATO exercises took place concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957. Operation Counter Punch, Operation Strikeback, and Operation Deep Water were together the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance so far, involving more than 250,000 men, 300 ships, and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey.[26]

NATO's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle's presidency (1959–1969) of France.[27] De Gaulle protested the strong role of the United States in NATO and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom. In a memorandum sent to US President Dwight Eisenhower and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958, he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate, which would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK.[28]

Considering the response to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defense-force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc, instead of being drawn into a larger war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.[29] In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command,[30] and it later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. That caused the United States to transfer 300 military aircraft out of France and to return control of the air-force bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.

Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defense by removing France's Atlantic and English Channel fleets from NATO command.[31] In 1966, all French armed forces were removed from NATO's integrated military command, and all non-French NATO troops were asked to leave France.[32] A ""seething"" U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk asked for ""clarification"" from De Gaulle about whether American soldiers buried in French cemeteries, having fallen in part to defend and liberate France in two world wars, would also have to leave.[33]  The withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from Rocquencourt, near Paris, to Casteau, Belgium, by 16 October 1967.[34] France remained a member of the alliance and committed to the defense of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack, with its own forces stationed in West Germany throughout the Cold War. A series of secret accords between the US and French officials, the Lemnitzer–Ailleret Agreements, detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO's command structure if East-West hostilities broke out.[35]

When de Gaulle announced his decision to withdraw from the integrated NATO command, US President Lyndon Johnson suggested that when de Gaulle ""comes rushing down like a locomotive on the track, why the Germans and ourselves, we just stand aside and let him go on by, then we are back together again.""[36]

That vision came true when France announced its return to full participation at the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit.[37]

During most of the Cold War, NATO's watch against the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact did not actually lead to direct military action. On 1 July 1968, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons opened for signature. NATO argued that its nuclear sharing arrangements did not breach the treaty since US forces controlled the weapons until a decision was made to go to war when the treaty would no longer be controlling. Few states then knew of the NATO nuclear sharing arrangements, which were not challenged. In May 1978, NATO countries officially defined two complementary aims of the Alliance: to maintain security and pursue détente. That was supposed to mean matching defences at the level rendered necessary by the Warsaw Pact's offensive capabilities without spurring a further arms race.[38]

On 12 December 1979, in light of a build-up of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and Pershing II theatre nuclear weapons in Europe.[39] The new warheads were also meant to strengthen the West's negotiating position regarding nuclear disarmament. That policy was called the Dual Track policy.[40] Similarly, in 1983 and 1984, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations in the event of war.[41] That action led to peace movement protests throughout Western Europe, and support for their deployment wavered, as many doubted whether the push for deployment could be sustained.

The membership of the organisation was then largely static. In 1974, as a consequence of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish co-operation, was readmitted in 1980.[42] The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is applicable only to attacks on member state territories north of the Tropic of Cancer.[43]

On 30 May 1982, NATO gained a new member when the newly-democratic Spain joined the alliance, as was confirmed by referendum in 1986. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military personnel, including as many as 435,000 forward-deployed US forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organised into four echelons.[44]

The Revolutions of 1989 and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991 removed the de facto main adversary of NATO and caused a strategic re-evaluation of NATO's purpose, nature, tasks, and focus on the continent of Europe. The shift started, with the 1990 signing in Paris of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe between NATO and the Soviet Union, which mandated specific military reductions across the continent, which continued after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.[45] European countries then accounted for 34 percent of NATO's military spending; by 2012, that had fallen to 21 percent.[46] NATO also began a gradual expansion to include countries of Central and Eastern Europe and extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not been thought of as NATO concerns.

An expansion of NATO came with German reunification on 3 October 1990, when the former East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the alliance. That had been agreed in the Two Plus Four Treaty earlier that year. To secure Soviet approval of a united Germany remaining in NATO, it was agreed that foreign troops and nuclear weapons would not be stationed in the east. There was no formal commitment in the agreement not to expand NATO to the east, but there are diverging views on whether negotiators gave informal commitments regarding further NATO expansion.[47][48][49] Jack Matlock, the American ambassador to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a ""clear commitment"" not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators had the impression that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland.[50] Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, said in a conversation with Eduard Shevardnadze, ""For us, however, one thing is certain: NATO will not expand to the east.""[50] In 1996, Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs that ""during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east,""[51] and he repeated that view in an interview in 2008.[52] However, in 2014 Gorbachev stated the opposite: ""The topic of 'NATO expansion' was not discussed at all [in 1990], and it wasn't brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Western leaders didn't bring it up, either.""[47][53] According to Robert Zoellick, a US State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, that appears to be a misperception, and no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made.[54] Harvard University historian Mark Kramer also rejects that an informal agreement existed.[47][55] Memorandums published by the National Security Archive in 2017 indicate that multiple assurances against NATO expansion were indeed made to Soviet leaders at the highest levels in 1990 and 1991.[56]

As part of restructuring, NATO's military structure was cut back and reorganized, with new forces such as the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed by 30 countries in 1999, ratified by Russia in 2000, but never ratified by any NATO member, and therefore never came into effect. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure but maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.[35][57]

Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, like the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1998, the NATO–Russia Permanent Joint Council was established. On 8 July 1997, three former communist countries (Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland) were invited to join NATO, which was accepted by all three, with Hungarian acceptance being endorsed in a referendum in which 85.3% of voters supported joining NATO.

Czech President Vaclav Havel welcomed the expansion: ""Never have we been part of such a broad, solid and binding security alliance, which at the same time respects in its essence the sovereignty and will of our nation."" Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek also welcomed the expansion: ""Poland forever returns where she has always belonged: the free world."" Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi stated that the expansion showed that Hungary was returning ""to her natural habitat."" The expansion was also welcomed by US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who stated that the expansion would do ""for Europe's east what NATO has already helped to do for Europe's west: steadily and systematically, we will continue erasing – without replacing – the line drawn in Europe by Stalin's bloody boot.""[58]

The expansion was criticized in the US by some policy experts as a ""policy error of historic proportions.""[59] According to George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and former advocate of the containment policy, the decision ""may be expected to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.""[60]

Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit and joined NATO on 29 March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. Slovenian membership was endorsed in a referendum in which 66.02% of voters supported joining.[citation needed] The entry of Romania into NATO is particularly notable as it put the strategic Focșani Gate under NATO control.[61]

New NATO structures were also formed while old ones were abolished. In 1997, NATO reached agreement on a significant downsizing of its command structure from 65 headquarters to 20.[62]

The NATO Response Force (NRF) was launched at the 2002 Prague summit on 21 November, the first summit in a former Comecon country. On 19 June 2003, a further restructuring of the NATO military commands began as the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic were abolished and a new command, Allied Command Transformation (ACT), was established in Norfolk, Virginia, United States, and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) became the Headquarters of Allied Command Operations (ACO). ACT is responsible for driving transformation (future capabilities) in NATO while ACO is responsible for current operations.[63] In March 2004, NATO's Baltic Air Policing began, which supported the sovereignty of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia by providing jet fighters to react to any unwanted aerial intrusions. Eight multinational jet fighters are based in Lithuania, the number of which was increased from four in 2014.[64] Also at the 2004 Istanbul summit, NATO launched the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative with four Persian Gulf nations.[65]

The 2006 Riga summit was held in Riga, Latvia, and highlighted the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit to be held in a country that had been part of the old Soviet Union.

At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Albania and Croatia, both of which joined NATO in April 2009. Georgia and Ukraine were also told that they could eventually become members.[66] The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence system. Studies for the system had begun in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, Russian Presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized the system as a threat.[67]

In 2009, US President Barack Obama proposed using the ship-based Aegis Combat System, but the plan still includes stations being built in Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Romania, and Poland.[68] NATO will also maintain the ""status quo"" in its nuclear deterrent in Europe by upgrading the targeting capabilities of the ""tactical"" B61 nuclear bombs stationed there and deploying them on the stealthier Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.[69][70] On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as an operational domain of war, just like land, sea, and aerial warfare. That means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.[71] Likewise, on 4 December 2019, NATO additionally recognized space warfare as an operational domain of war.[72]

Montenegro became the 29th member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.[73][74] On 27 March 2020, North Macedonia became the 30th member after a dispute about its name was resolved with Greece.[75][76]

The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by NATO nations, and Poland invoked Article 4 in meetings.[77] At the 2014 Wales summit, the leaders of NATO's member states formally committed for the first time spend the equivalent of at least 2% of their gross domestic product on defence by 2024, which was previously only an informal guideline.[78] In February 2015, NATO committed to forming a new ""spearhead"" force of 5000 troops at bases in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria.[79][80]

NATO did not condemn the 2016–present purges in Turkey.[81] As a result of the Turkish invasion of Kurdish-inhabited areas in Syria, Turkey's intervention in Libya and the Cyprus–Turkey maritime zones dispute, there are signs of a schism between Turkey and other NATO members.[82][83] On 1 August 2018, the US Department of Treasury sanctioned two senior Turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson.[84] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that the US behavior would force Turkey to look for new friends and allies.[85] The US–Turkey dispute appears to be one of the most serious diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies in years.[86][87]

The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine led eight NATO countries—Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia—to trigger Article 4.[88] The North Atlantic Council issued a statement in which it condemned the invasion ""in the strongest possible terms"".[89] Elements of the NATO Response Force were activated for the first time in NATO's history.[90] In March, NATO leaders met at Brussels for an extraordinary summit which also involved Group of Seven and European Union leaders.[91] NATO member states agreed to establish four additional battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.[92] The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and its carrier strike group were placed under the command of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO, marking the first time an entire US carrier group was placed under NATO command since the Cold War.[93] As a direct consequence of the invasion, both Finland and Sweden applied for membership in 18 May 2022 with Finland joining in 4 April 2023 and Sweden joining in 7 March 2024.

The Defence Planning Committee was a former senior decision-making body on matters relating to the integrated military structure of the Alliance. It was dissolved after a major committee review in June 2010, with its responsibilities absorbed by the North Atlantic Council.

In NATO: The First Five Years, Lord Ismay described the civilian structure as follows:[94]

The ..Office of the Secretary-General [is] directed by an Executive Secretary, Captain R.D. Coleridge (UK), who is also Secretary to the Council. He is responsible for supervising the general processing of the work of the Council and their committees, including the provision of all secretarial assistance, as well as supervision of the administrative services of the Staff/Secretariat itself. Thus the Secretariat provides secretaries to all the Council's principal committees and working groups - apart from those of a strictly technical nature - and ensures coordination between them... On the Staff side, there are three main divisions corresponding to the three principal aspects of NATO's work, each under an Assistant Secretary-General. Ambassador Sergio Fenoaltea (Italy) heads the Political Affairs Division, M. Rene Sergent (France) the Economics and Finance Division, and Mr. Lowell P. Weicker (USA) the Production and Logistics Division. The Divisions' tasks are to prepare, in close touch with delegations, proposed action in their respective fields for consideration by the appropriate committee or by the Council. In addition to the main divisions, there are three other offices working directly to the Secretary-General. These are the Office of Statistics (Mr. Loring Wood of the USA), the Financial Comptroller's Office (M. A. J. Bastin of Belgium), and the Division of Information (Mr. Geoffrey Parsons, Jr. of the USA). The Information Division, besides providing material about NATO for the use of member governments, (it does not engage in independent operations), is also the press and public relations branch of the civilian authority.

The Strategic Commanders were the former Major NATO Commanders, who sat atop a command hierarchy consisting of Major Subordinate Commanders (MSCs), Principal Subordinate Commanders (PSCs), and Sub-PSCs.[95] The Military Committee had an executive body, the Standing Group, made up of representatives from France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The Standing Group was abolished during the major reform of 1967 that resulted from France's departure from the NATO Military Command Structure.[96]

A key step in establishing the NATO Command Structure was the North Atlantic Council's selection of General Dwight Eisenhower as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in December 1950.[96] After Eisenhower arrived in Paris in January 1951, he and the other members of the multinational Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) Planning Group immediately began to devise a structure for the new Allied Command Europe. NATO official documents state, ""The cornerstone of the NATO Military Command Structure was laid... when the North Atlantic Council approved D.C. 24/3 on 18 December 1951.""[97] They quickly decided to divide Allied Command Europe into three regions: Allied Forces Northern Europe, containing Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic; Allied Forces Central Europe, and Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH), covering Italy and the Mediterranean. SHAPE was established at Rocquencourt, west of Paris.

The British post of Commander in Chief Mediterranean Fleet was given a dual-hatted role as NATO Commander in Chief of Allied Forces Mediterranean in charge of all forces assigned to NATO in the Mediterranean Area. The British made strong representations in discussions regarding the Mediterranean NATO command structure since they wished to retain their direction of NATO naval command in the Mediterranean to protect their sea lines of communication running through the Mediterranean to the Middle East and the Far East.[98]

In 1952, after Greece and Turkey joined NATO [99] Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST) was created in İzmir, Turkey, under a US Army General because of the geographic distance of both countries from the LANDSOUTH headquarters as well as political disagreements over which nation should be the overall commander for its ground forces.

With the establishment of Allied Command Atlantic (ACLANT) on 30 January 1952, the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic joined the previously created Supreme Allied Commander Europe as one of the alliance's two Major NATO Commanders.[100] A third was added when Allied Command Channel was established on 21 February 1952 to control the English Channel and North Sea area and deny them to the enemy and to protect the sea lanes of communication.[101][102] The establishment of this post and the agreement that it was to be filled by the British Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, was part of the compromise that allowed an American officer to take up the SACLANT post. Previously Commander-in-Chief Portsmouth had controlled multinational naval operations in the area under WUDO auspices. In due course, the CINCHAN role was assumed by the British Commander-in-Chief Fleet.

In 1966, when French President Charles de Gaulle withdrew French forces from the military command structure, NATO's headquarters was forced to move to Belgium. SHAPE was moved to Casteau, north of the Belgian city of Mons. Headquarters Allied Forces Central Europe was moved from the Chateau de Fontainebleau, near Paris to Brunssum, in the Netherlands.

By June 1991, it was clear that Allied Forces Central Europe, a Major Subordinate Command, could be reduced, with the Soviet threat disappearing. Six multinational corps were to replace the previous eight.[104] Announcements in June 1991 presaged main defensive forces consisting of six multinational corps. Two were to be under German command, one with a US division, one under Belgian command with a pending offer of a U.S. brigade, one under U.S. command with a German division, one under joint German-Danish command (LANDJUT), and one under Dutch command. The new German IV Corps was to be stationed in eastern German and was not to be associated with the NATO structure.

On July 1, 1994, the Alliance disestablished Allied Command Channel but retained many of its subordinate structures after the reshuffling. Most of the headquarters were absorbed within ACE, particularly within the new Allied Forces Northwestern Europe.[105]

From 1994 to 1999, ACE had three Major Subordinate Commands, AFNORTHWEST, AFCENT, and AFSOUTH. In 1995 NATO began a Long Term Study to examine post-Cold War strategy and structure. Recommendations from the study for a new, streamlined structure emerged in 1996.[106] The European and Atlantic commands were to be retained, but the number of major commands in Europe was to be cut from three to two, Regional Command North Europe and Regional Command South Europe. Activation of the new RC SOUTH occurred in September 1999, and in March 2000 Headquarters AFNORTHWEST closed and the new RC NORTH was activated.[107] The headquarters of the two Regional Commands were known as Regional Headquarters South (RHQ South) and RHQ NORTH respectively. Each was to supervise air, naval, and land commands for their region as well as a number of Joint Subregional Commands (JSRCs). Among the new JSRCs was Joint Headquarters Southwest, which was activated in Madrid in September 1999.

Prior to the reorganization, the NATO website listed 43 different agencies and organizations and five project committees/offices as of 15 May 2008.[108] including:",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_NATO
Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania,"The Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos demokratinė darbo partija, LDDP) was a political party in Lithuania. It was the successor of the Soviet-era Communist Party of Lithuania.[1] The youth organization of LDDP was called Lithuanian Labourist Youth Union (Lietuvos leiboristų jaunimo unija).

The party traced its roots to December 1989, when the majority of the Communist Party of Lithuania broke away from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. CPL (independent) (as it became known after formation of (CPL (CPSU)) took part in the 1990 Lithuanian Supreme Soviet election, in which the party came in second place. Amid this position, CPL (independent) joined the national unity government, which included almost all parties and organisations in the Supreme Council except the CPL (CPSU), Lithuanian Democratic Party (LDP) and the Association of Poles in Lithuania (ZPL). Algirdas Brazauskas became Deputy Prime Minister of Lithuania in the Prunskienė Cabinet.

By the autumn of 1990, there were several new names proposed for the party (etc. Lietuvos socialistų partija (Socialist Party of Lithuania), Lietuvos socialinės pažangos partija (Social Advancement Party of Lithuania), Lietuvos komunistų partija (Communist Party of Lithuania), Lietuvos demokratinė darbo partija (Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania)).[2] In December 1990, the main body of the CPL reorganized as the DLPL.

By the late winter of 1992, the party overtook Sąjūdis as the most supported political party in Lithuania.[3] The LDDP won the 1992 parliamentary election, gaining 43% of the vote giving it 73 seats in the Seimas. It is the best results for any political party in Lithuanian parliamentary election up to this date.[4] LDDP was led by Algirdas Brazauskas. Because Brazauskas was elected as the first president in 1993, he was required to stop his activities in any parties. Adolfas Šleževičius became the party leader and the Prime Minister. After Šleževičius was charged with corruption in 1996, he was replaced by Česlovas Juršėnas.

In the 1996 parliamentary election, LDDP got about 9.5% of the votes and won 10 seats in the parliament. In next few years the party's support remained relatively steady. The party remained the main opposition party in Seimas, although its member and former Prime Minister Laurynas Mindaugas Stankevičius was Minister of Heath in the Vagnorius Cabinet between 1998 and 1999. Prior to the 2000 parliamentary election, the LDDP formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, the New Democracy Party and the Union of the Russians of Lithuania. The electoral coalition was named after Algirdas Brazauskas and it won a majority of the votes. In this coalition, parties formed a joint list in the nationwide constituency, but in single-member constituencies the coalition stood only one candidate per constituency to avoid vote splitting. In the elections the LDDP won 26 seats (the largest number of seats among the coalition's parties and third largest number of seats in the parliament).

In 2001, LDDP merged with the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. The merged party took the Social Democratic name, but was dominated by former LDDP members. LDDP's name and logo were registered as a trademark, what prevented establishment of party with the same name and logo.[5] Attempts of reviving the LDDP, like the ""Democratic Labour and Unity Party"" (DDVP) of Brazauskas' widow Kristina Brazauskienė [lt] or the Social Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LSDDP) only had limited success.

In the first half of 1990s, LDDP had around twenty per cent support nationally. This support was not uniform – mainly the party had the largest support in large cities with large factories and Russian speaking communities (e. g. Klaipėda). The only exception of large cities was Kaunas, where Sąjūdis (and later the Homeland Union) had greater support.[6][7] In rural areas, the party's support came from districts with developed industry (e. g. Kelmė district).[8]

As Lithuania became a service economy in the late 1990s, the party's support declined to around 10%. The other loss of voters came from parties representing Russian speakers (e. g. Union of the Russians of Lithuania). Also, the LDDP lost support to the New Union (Social Liberals).[9]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Labour_Party_of_Lithuania

First Congress of Lithuanian Women,"The First Congress of Lithuanian Women (Lithuanian: Pirmasis lietuvių moterų suvažiavimas) took place on 6–7 October [O.S. 23–24 September] 1907[1] in Kaunas (then part of the Russian Empire, now Lithuania). It was organized by Catholic priests in preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma but discussed only cultural and economic issues. The organizers attempted to invite representatives of different social classes and political affiliations leading to disagreements between socialists and Catholic clergy, and between educated intellectuals and less educated villagers. The congress resolved to establish the Lithuanian Women's Union. However, disagreements between the liberals and the Catholics led to splintering of the women's movement and to the establishment of the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922.

The Lithuanian Women's Association was established in September 1905 during the Russian Revolution in Vilnius. It was organized and headed by women members of the intelligentsia. Different developments took place in Kaunas where women's issues were taken up by the members of the Catholic clergy, particularly by priest Povilas Januševičius [lt]. The priests organized the Society of Saint Zita for female servants and maids.[2]

In preparation for the October 1907 election to the third State Duma, Januševičius organized the First Congress of Lithuanian Women (the women were not allowed to vote in the election).[2] According to Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, the congress originated from an idea to establish a shop of homemade textiles and a need to recruit village women for the enterprise.[3] There were very few women intellectuals in Kaunas. The priests selected seven women for the organizational committee, however, according to Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, only one of them – Cecilija Leonienė, the wife of attorney Petras Leonas – had attended a gymnasium. The organizational committee invited women from villagers (more conservative and Catholic) and the women intellectuals from Vilnius (more liberal and anti-religious). To obtain the government permit for the gathering, it would not discuss any social or political issues, only cultural and economic affairs.[2]

The congress was opened by writer Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė. Priests then wanted to elect a board to preside over the congress with a priest as its chairman. Petkevičaitė felt it was insulting to the women and proposed herself as the chair of the congress. She also proposed Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė and Marija Pečkauskaitė as vice-chairs, Ona Pleirytė-Puidienė [lt] as secretary, and Petras Leonas as advisor. According to Leonas, due to poor health and weak voice, Petkevičaitė presided over the proceedings only on paper; Pleirytė-Puidienė managed most of the actual work.[2] None of the members of the original organizational committee got included on the board which left them feeling sidelined and snubbed.[3]

The proceedings opened with a cantata about Lithuanian women composed specifically for the event by Ksaveras Sakalauskas-Vanagėlis [lt].[2] The first day featured several speeches and presentations on the women's movement in Lithuania by Leonienė, on hardships of village women by Julija Žymantienė-Žemaitė, on public duties (e.g. working as low-paid teachers or volunteer as nurses) of women intellectuals by Petkevičaitė, on women's professional education by Teresė Kubilinskaitė [lt], on teaching the history of Lithuania by Kymantaitė-Čiurlioninenė, on women's honor by Pečkauskaitė, on schools, on ways to combat alcoholism, on homemade textiles, on vegetables and fruits. Most speakers stressed the need for education to improve one's circumstances. Women attendees also complained about their suffering – villagers about husbands who abused alcohol, city maids and servants about their exploitative employers.[2] The women planned to publish a book will all presentations, but could not find a publisher.[1] Three presentations were published in Vilniaus žinios.[3]

The second day saw more heated debates between socialists and Catholic clergy.[2] Men became more active during these debates; they constituted a third of all speakers.[3] The congress discussed whether to establish a newspaper dedicated to women's issues as well as the relationship between Lithuanian Women's Association and the Russian Union for Women's Equality. It was decided that the Lithuanian association should not become a chapter of the Russian union and should collaborate with the union as long as this collaboration did not hinder the women's movement in Lithuania. The congress concluded with the adoption of a resolution which called for the establishment of the new Lithuanian Women's Union which would participate in the international women's movement. Most contentious issue was the election of a 10-member committee to organize this new union as socialists and Catholic clergy fought for influence.[2] The committee included Gabrielė Petkevičaitė as chair, Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė and Marija Pečkauskaitė as vicechairs, Ona Pleirytė-Puidienė [lt] and Marija Putvinskaitė-Žmuidzinavičienė [lt] as secretaries, Celina Leonienė and Kotryna Norkytė as treasurers, and Joana Griniuvienė, Elena Vaitkevičienė, and Teklė Augustinavičiūtė as members of the revision sub-committee. Several other women, including Felicija Bortkevičienė and Julija Žymantienė, were selected as candidates in case of any resignations.[1]

The apolitical agenda attracted representatives from different organizations and political parties. Therefore, the congress included women from different social classes and political convictions but since the proceedings were in the Lithuanian language, other nationalities (Russian, Polish, Jewish) were not represented. The total number of attendees is unknown. Participants later put estimates ranging from 350 to 700. The attendees had to purchase tickets that cost 25 kopeks for women and one ruble for men.[2]

The women attendees included essentially all Lithuanian cultural elite at the time – Gabrielė Petkevičaitė-Bitė, Sofija Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė, Ona Pleirytė-Puidienė [lt], Julija Žymantienė-Žemaitė, Marija Pečkauskaitė (Šatrijos Ragana), Cecilija Leonienė, Felicija Bortkevičienė, Liudvika Didžiulienė, Marija Putvinskaitė-Žmuidzinavičienė [lt], Teresė Kubilinskaitė [lt]. Men participants included Petras Leonas, Mykolas Sleževičius, Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas, Konstantinas Olšauskas, Povilas Dogelis [lt], Vincas Kapsukas, Karolis Požela, Steponas Kairys, Augustinas Janulaitis,[2] Kazys Grinius.[3]

The congress failed to unify women activists – women's movement in Lithuania split into two main branches: conservative Catholic and liberal-socialist.[4] The disagreements became evident during the congress and only deepened when each side began publishing accusing articles in the Lithuanian press.[3] The 10-member committee started working on the statute of the planned Lithuanian Women's Union. The first draft was prepared mainly by Kymantaitė-Čiurlionienė and Pleirytė-Puidienė based on the statute of the Russian Union for Women's Equality.[1] In November, the statute was submitted to the Governor-General of Vilna for approval, but it was rejected. The Catholics protested this statute as they wanted to copy examples of organizations of Belgian and German Catholic women, not Russian liberals.[1] After a failed attempt to find a compromise in December 1907, the Catholic camp established the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Catholic association was approved by Kovno Governorate. The Tsarist authorities would not approve another women's organization thus effectively preventing the Lithuanian Women's Union from being organized.[1] The Women's Union was officially established only in 1922.[5]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Congress_of_Lithuanian_Women
Union of Kėdainiai,"The Union of Kėdainiai or Agreement of Kėdainiai (Lithuanian: Kėdainių unija, Swedish: Kėdainiai förbund) was an agreement between magnates of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the king of the Swedish Empire, Charles X Gustav, that was signed on 20 October 1655, during the Swedish Deluge of the Second Northern War.[1] In contrast to the Treaty of Kėdainiai of 17 August, which put Lithuania under Swedish protection,[1] the Swedish–Lithuanian union's purpose was to end the Lithuanian union with Poland and to set up the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a protectorate under the Swedish Crown with some of the estates being ruled by the Radziwiłł (Radvila) family.

The agreement was short-lived since the Swedish defeat at the Battles of Warka and Prostki and an uprising organised by the pro-Commonwealth nobility in Poland and Lithuania put an end to Swedish power and to the Radziwiłłs' influence.

The Radziwiłł family owned vast areas of land in Lithuania and Poland, and some of its members were dissatisfied with the role of the magnates, who in Poland–Lithuania theoretically had the same rights as the Polish nobility. Eventually, the interests of the wealthy clan, known as the ""Family"", and the Crown began to drift apart.

Janusz Radziwiłł was the head of the Biržai line of Radziwiłłs and a leader of Lithuanian Protestants. He was a favorite of King Władysław IV, from whom he received the position of Lithuanian Field Hetman, but was an ardent opponent of his brother and successor John Casimir.[2][3] Shortly after his election in 1649, he supported George II Rákóczi's efforts to seize the Polish throne by making a deal with Transylvania. At the same time, he established contacts with Sweden for the first time, seeking to separate Lithuania from the Crown.[2][3] In the following years, Janusz Radziwiłł grew closer to the king, taking part in battles against the Cossacks in Ukraine.[4] He took advantage of his successes by forcing the king to appoint him voivode of Vilnius and grand hetman of Lithuania, thus making him the most important dignitary in Lithuania.[3] However, the king, wanting to limit Radziwiłł's omnipotence, made loyal Wincenty Gosiewski field hetman and treasurer of Lithuania, and divided the Lithuanian army into two divisions.[5][3] In the face of the Russian invasion, Radziwiłł refused to take offensive action and demanded that the king conclude a truce with Moscow and enter into alliance talks with Sweden. At the same time, Radziwiłł re-established contacts with George II Rákóczi urging him to claim the Polish throne and promising his support.[6] The king in turn planned to deprive him of his Hetman's office.[7]

On October 3, 1654, Smolensk, the only major fortress capable of stopping the march of the Russian army deep into Lithuania, fell. At this point Radziwiłł entered into secret talks with Sweden seeking an agreement with them. But as he was still hoping to establish an alliance between the Commonwealth and Sweden, upon hearing of the ongoing negotiations he set out in the spring of 1655 on an expedition deep into Belarus against the Russian army.[8]

In 1654, during the Swedish-Russian invasion of Poland, known as The Deluge, two notable princes of the Radziwiłł clan, Janusz and Bogusław, began negotiations with Swedish King Charles X Gustav that were aimed at dissolving the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Union. In July 1655, Swedish troops crossed the borders of the Commonwealth. The first attack on July 24 was directed at Greater Poland. The Crown army, consisting mostly of pospolite ruszenie and devoid of a commander, capitulated before the Swedes. The capitulation, signed at Ujście, severed the relations of the Greater Poland voivodeships with the rest of the state, which had recognized Charles X Gustav as its ruler.[9] Lithuania was then in turmoil and was being attacked on two separate fronts by Russia and Sweden, and a Ukrainian peasant revolt, known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising, was spilling into the Grand Duchy's southern regions from Ukraine.

Swedish troops also entered Duchy of Livonia capturing Dyneburg on July 17. At the same time, Russian and Cossack armies took offensives approaching Vilnius. The Lithuanian army was few in number. It consisted of three parts: the wojsko zaciężne, the crown reinforcements and the pospolite ruszenie. The crown reinforcements constituted a considerable force of up to 5,000 men. The wojsko zaciężne was of similar size, the size of the pospolite ruszenie is unknown, but it did not represent much military value. In early July, the king ordered the Crown army to leave Lithuania and head for Prussia. This act removed any hope of an effective defense of the Grand Duchy.[10]

In view of this, on July 29, Vilnius voivode Janusz Radziwiłł, Vilnius bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz and Lithuanian equerry Bogusław Radziwiłł called on the Swedish army for help.[11] Swedish troops entered Lithuania essentially as allies.[12] The Lithuanian lords probably knew about the events in Ujście. They placed themselves under the protection of the Swedish king, with no obligation to swear an oath of allegiance or sever ties with the Polish Crown. The proposals envisioned a union of the three states, or only Sweden and Lithuania, if Poland found itself under alien ruler.[11] At the same time, both Radzwills demanded the creation of fiefdoms for themselves, separate from the Grand Duchy, and covering much of its territory, as well as parts of the Crown.[13] Meanwhile, the Swedes also held talks with the Russians, to whom they proposed various lines for dividing the Grand Duchy's territory between them.[14]

Earlier, on August 3, royal secretary Krzysztof Scipio del Campo of Jan Kazimierz arrived in Lithuania, with permission for the Lithuanian lords to enter into truce talks with Moscow and Sweden.[15] The proposals for talks were rejected by the tsarist army, which captured Vilnius on August 9.[16] Part of the army, having received no pay, left the ranks of the army after the fall of Vilnius.[17] On August 10 in Riga, Magnus de la Gardie accepted the Lithuanian terms brought by Gabriel Lubieniecki but not without changes, taking the Grand Duchy under his protection on behalf of the Swedish king. The Lithuanian army was to be attached to the Swedish one, the Grand Duchy was to take on the maintenance of the entire army, the Swedes were to take control of all fortresses. The question of the Grand Duchy's relationship to the Crown and Sweden and the fief principalities for the Radziwiłłs was omitted.[18][19] On August 11, he called on the tsar's commanders to stop further march deep into Lithuania, which is under the protection of the Swedish king.[20]

Lubieniecki returned to Janusz Radziwiłł on August 15, who was not fully satisfied with the negotiated terms, but accepted them. And with him 436 people at the Josvainiai convention, among them field hetman Wincenty Gosiewski, castellan of Samogitia Eustachy Kierdej, and Vilnius canon Jerzy Białłozor.[21] But again conditions were changed, they stipulated the separation of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from Sweden, the inviolability of the union with the Crown, joint participation with the Crown in the peace talks, the non-use of Lithuanian troops against Polish ones, only temporary surrender of fortresses, and agreed to a possible union with Sweden, but on an equal basis.[22] On 17 August, Janusz Radziwiłł signed the Treaty of Kėdainiai (Instrumentum Lithuanicae deditionis), which placed the Grand Duchy under Swedish protection.[1][19] The nobility gathered in Braslaw, 116 in number, also approved the act, along with 38 exulants, 3 clergymen and 3 townsmen.[23] A number of lords, however, refused to endorse the act, among them the bishop of Samogitia, Piotr Parczewski, and the starosta of Samogitia, Jerzy Karol Hlebowicz.[23] Similarly, the nobility gathered around Grodno rejected the act of Josvainiai, remaining loyal to John II Casimir.[23] Soldiers who denounced obedience to the hetmans, as well as the nobility of Brest voivodeship, formed a confederation on August 23 in defense of the Fatherland and King John II Casimir in Virbalis, led by voivode of Witebsk Paweł Sapieha.[24]

Eventually, most of the Polish-controlled Lithuanian army surrendered to the Swedes, and the state collapsed. Most of the Crown of Poland, along with west of Lithuania, was occupied by Swedish forces, and the Russians seized most of Lithuania (except Samogitia and parts of Suvalkija and Aukštaitija). The August 17 act was not approved by the Swedes, who did not want war with Moscow, but with the Crown. Nonetheless, the Swedes moved their troops led by Gustaf Adolf Lewenhaupt into the strongholds of Biržai and Radviliškis. On September 17, Bengt Skytte arrived in Kėdainiai. Negotiations on a new treaty began.[25]

Despite the officially proclaimed protection of the Swedish king, the Moscow army continued its march deep into Lithuania, occupying Kaunas (August 16) and Grodno (August 18). Moscow then demanded the renunciation of its claims to Lithuania, in exchange for a guarantee of the inviolability of Courland and Prussia.[26] At the same time, Moscow's deputy Vasily Likhariev arrived in Kėdainiai on August 30, promising to preserve rights, property and religious freedom in exchange for surrender to the tsar.[26] Janusz Radziwiłł rejected these proposals, giving the existing agreement with Sweden as the reason. Field hetman Wincenty Gosiewski was of different opinion, he was ready to make territorial concessions in exchange for the Commonwealth's anti-Swedish alliance with Moscow.[26] Nothing came of the talks, and on September 9 the tsar adopted the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania.[26]

On October 10, Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie arrived in Kėdainiai in an attempt to force the nobility to sign the final agreement. Janusz Radziwiłł's position was becoming weaker and weaker, he himself was constrained by private deals with the Swedes, and he was losing supporters. The Samogitian nobility, gathered in Kėdainiai, formed a confederation manifesting their separateness.[27] Bishop Jerzy Tyszkiewicz was away in Königsberg, and Bogusław Radziwiłł in his estates in Podlachia. On September 29, 1655, the army loyal to Janusz Radziwiłł, Cyprian Paweł Brzostowski in his letter to Bogusław Radziwiłł estimates at ""under a thousand""; at the time, these were exclusively foreign contingents.[28] Particularly painful for the hetman was the departure from the ranks of his army by the hussar and armoured banners, but these returned to his command later and served him until his death.[29]

On 20 October 1655, Janusz Radziwiłł signed an agreement with the Swedes at his castle at Kėdainiai. According to the treaty, signed by over 1,000 members of the Lithuanian nobility, the Polish–Lithuanian Union was declared null and void. In exchange for military assistance against Russia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania would become a protectorate of Sweden, with a personal union joining both states. In Lithuania, the king was to be represented by his governor (Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, later Bengt Skytte with the title of legate), who did not have to be a citizen of the Grand Duchy. He was to be assisted in governing by deputies, three from each powiat. The armies were to be united, the nobility lost the right to free election and influence over declaring war and making peace. Other rights and religious freedoms were preserved.[27] In addition, The Family would be given two sovereign principalities carved from its lands within the Grand Duchy, and the Lithuanian nobility would retain its liberties and privileges. Janusz Radziwiłł signed a private agreement with the Swedes, under which he received large territorial concessions and revenues; his nephew Bogusław similarly, but on a smaller scale.[30]

The signing of the Kėdainiai Treaty strengthened Swedish rule in Lithuania in the short term and weakened the forces loyal to the Commonwealth and John II Casimir. King John II Casimir, who was staying in Silesia, took Paweł Sapieha's confederates into the pay of the Crown treasury.[31] On September 10, he granted them the traitors' estates in Lithuania. Instead of attempting to join the royal forces, they began plundering Radziwiłł's estates. They then entered into negotiations with Moscow, proposing a truce. This had little effect, and after October 20 Moscow took a further offensive, defeating Sapieha's troops.[32] At the same time, Paweł Sapieha maintained contacts with the Swedes, through the Swedish envoy Jan Fryderyk Sapieha. He eventually accepted the Swedish king's protection on December 5.[32]

Its main proponent, Janusz Radziwiłł, died only two months after it was signed, on 31 December at Tykocin Castle, which was then besieged by forces loyal to the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania, John II Casimir. The castle was soon taken by Paweł Jan Sapieha, who immediately succeeded Janusz Radziwiłł to the office of Grand Hetman of Lithuania.

The tide of the war soon turned and a popular uprising in Poland broke the power of the Swedish army. The Swedish occupation of Lithuania sparked a similar uprising in Lithuania. The Swedish defeat and the eventual retreat from the territories of the Commonwealth abruptly ended the plans of Janusz's cousin Bogusław, who lost his army in the Battle of Prostki and died in exile in Königsberg on 31 December 1669.

With the passing of both cousins, the Radziwiłł family fortunes waned. Bogusław became commonly known as Gnida (""Louse"") by his fellow nobles, and Janusz was called Zdrajca (""Traitor""). Their treason against the Commonwealth largely overshadowed the deeds of the next generation's numerous other family members, including Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł (1625–1680), who served faithfully against the Swedes.

Although seen as an act of treason by contemporaries, modern views on the Swedish–Lithuanian accord differ. Some argue that the arrangement with the Swedes was made by Janusz Radziwiłł not out of greed and the political ambition, but rather out of Realpolitik. According to another theory, Janusz Radziwiłł was merely attempting to secure a strong ally against Russia. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lacked the resources to fight a war on two fronts, and the Polish Crown, which now had its own serious problems and could supply only trifling amounts of money and military forces. However, some Lithuanian intellectuals during the National Revival, including Maironis, praised the Lithuanian nobility for trying to secede from Poland and secure the sovereignty of Lithuania.[33] In 1995, Lithuania and Sweden have celebrated the 340th anniversary of the union as a symbol of friendship and historical bonds shared by the two countries.[34]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Kėdainiai

Lithuanian Education Society Rytas,"The Lithuanian Education Society Rytas (Lithuanian: Lietuvių švietimo draugija „Rytas“; ""rytas"" means morning or dawn) was a Roman Catholic society fostering education in the Lithuanian language mostly in the Vilnius Region, then fiercely contested between Lithuania and the Second Polish Republic, now split between Lithuania and Belarus. Established in 1913, the society maintained some 100 primary schools (mostly one-room schools), 50 evening classes, Vytautas the Great Gymnasium and Teacher's Seminary in Vilnius (Wilno, Vilna) in 1927.[1] Due to political tensions between Poland and Lithuania as well as wider Polonization policies, Rytas faced increasing difficulties and restrictions in maintaining its schools. Similar situation existed with Polish schools in Lithuania (see Lithuanization). The situation continued to worsen as both sides increased restrictions in retribution.[2] As schools were closed, Rytas shifted its focus to maintaining community reading rooms. After the death of Józef Piłsudski in 1935, the rooms were often raided by police and closed. Eventually, the society was abolished by Polish authorities in February 1938. Only the Vytautas the Great Gymnasium was allowed to operate. After the Polish ultimatum of March 1938, diplomatic relations were established between Poland and Lithuania and Rytas was allowed to operate again in May 1939. It could not resume its activities due to World War II and was abolished again soon after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. The society, with the same mission of promoting Lithuanian-language education, was reestablished in 2004.

After the failed Uprising of 1863, the Tsarist regime enacted strict Russification policies: the Lithuanian press was prohibited, all non-government schools were closed, and government schools prohibited the use of the Lithuanian language.[3] The restrictions were lifted in 1904 and Lithuanians organized societies Saulė (Sun) in 1906 in Kovno Governorate and Žiburys (light, beacon) in 1905 in the Suwałki Governorate to fund and operate Lithuanian schools.[3]

The developments in the Vilna Governorate, which had an ethnically mixed population, were slower. In February 1907, Lithuanian activists (Antanas Smetona, brothers Antanas and Jonas Vileišis, priests Juozas Tumas-Vaižgantas and Vladas Mironas, and others) established educational Society Vilniaus Aušra (Dawn of Vilnius).[4] The first chairman was Smetona and Tumas was his secretary, but soon they resigned. The new chairman was priest Juozas Bagdonavičius (Bagdonas) and Liudas Gira was his secretary.[4] The society was active both in Kovno and Vilna Governorates and established 17 local chapters. Most active of them were in Alanta, Žasliai, Bagaslaviškis. However, Tsarist authorities closed several chapters and the society was liquidated in December 1908.[4]

The idea of an educational society was once again raised by the intellectuals in a meeting of Aušra publishers in Vilnius in 1911.[5] Its statute was approved by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 29 November 1912 and the founding meeting took place at the clergy house of the Church of All Saints, Vilnius on 31 January 1913.[5] The meeting, chaired by Jonas Basanavičius, elected a six-member board, which included priest Jonas Steponavičius (chairman), priest Vladas Mironas, writer Liudas Gira, and Jonas Basanavičius. Antanas Smetona was a candidate, but was not elected.[6]

The society's goals were to establish and fund Lithuanian-language primary schools, evening classes for adults, a seminary for teachers, reading rooms, bookshops, and other educational institutions in the Roman Catholic spirit.[5] It published its news in Viltis and Aušra and encouraged establishment of local chapters. By the end of 1913, according to a list published in Šaltinis, the society had 31 chapters, including three in Vilnius.[5] Rytas wanted to establish grammar schools (Школа грамоты) but was allowed to organize only one-year or two-year schools and only if a qualified teacher was available.[6] The first schools were organized in Dieveniškės, Linkmenys, Musteika, Perloja, Švenčionėliai, Valkininkai.[5] During the first three years, Rytas established about 120 schools.[7]

During World War I, from about August 1915 to November 1918, Vilnius Region was part of the German Oberost. Initially, the Germans banned Rytas, but after modifications to its statute, it was allowed to operate schools but not to establish new chapters.[7] Despite difficult wartime conditions, Rytas established courses for teachers, which were directed by Aleksandras Stulginskis and which grew to a seminary, and took over the Lithuanian gymnasium,[7] established by Jonas Basanavičius, Mykolas Biržiška, and Povilas Gaidelionis [lt] in October 1915. It was the second (after the Panevėžys Gymnasium which opened a week earlier) gymnasium to teach in the Lithuanian language.[8]

After the Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, Vilnius region was incorporated into the Republic of Central Lithuania, a puppet state of the Second Polish Republic. Almost immediately Lithuanian organizations, including Rytas, faced increased scrutiny and restrictions. The Lithuanian gymnasium for girls was closed in August 1921 and the boys' gymnasium (renamed to Vytautas the Great Gymnasium) was forcibly removed from its premises in October 1921.[9] In 1923, the regional education commission began demanding that each school independently obtained a permit which was valid for only a year (multi-year permits were introduced in 1927).[5] The commission had to approve each teacher, and it refused to approve if they were not Polish citizens or did not have certificates of morality (świadectwo moralności), i.e. a proof of correct political leanings. For example, in 1926, of 106 proposed teachers only 56 were approved.[5] In July 1924, Minister Stanisław Grabski sponsored a law which regulated schools of ethnic minorities.[2] Other requirements and limitations applied to teachers' education, textbooks, classroom hygiene, etc.[5] These requirements particularly affected Ukrainian and Belarusian schools. Attitudes towards Lithuanian schools were more lenient, perhaps in hopes of normalizing the tensions between Poland and Lithuania.[2]

The situation of Lithuanian schools and Rytas society began deteriorating when 44 schools and the teachers' seminary was closed on 4–5 October 1927.[5] At the same time, seminary director Kristupas Čibiras, Rytas chairman Petras Kraujalis, and 23 other Lithuanian teachers and activists were arrested.[10] It was a retribution for the Lithuanian decision to close more than 60 Polish schools in Lithuania.[11] In 1928, Rytas maintained the gymnasium in Vilnius with 366 students, a vocational evening school, teachers' courses, 103 schools with 3,560 students, and 80 evening courses for adults with 1,765 students.[5] Of the schools, only 52 had official permits. Some of the closed or non-certified schools continued to operate illegally.[5]

Teachers at Rytas schools often initiated the establishments of a local chapter of the Society of Saint Casimir for the Education and Care of Young People which became more active in 1927.[12] The two societies shared similar goals and cooperated with each other; for example, sharing Lithuanian publications.[13] In 1931, with funding from Lithuania, Rytas purchased Vileišis Palace and moved its headquarters to the first floor. The second floor and the attic was rented by the Lithuanian Scientific Society.[14]

In spring 1931, the Polish Sejm adopted a new law which further restricted private schools. No new permits were issued while old schools were closed by various inspectors.[5] The number of schools decreased from 91 in 1931 to 73 in 1932. New instructions from the Polish Ministry of Education prescribed requirements for school buildings which were practically impossible to meet – new dedicated buildings had to build.[5] In 1933, Rytas had only 21 approved schools and of those only 16 had approved teachers. Realizing that it was losing ground, Rytas began focusing on education of adults and establishing reading rooms. Most of these rooms were headed by now-unemployed teachers, others by university or gymnasium students.[5] The rooms organized readings of books and periodicals, discussions, lectures, courses for children and adults, various social events and gatherings, etc. In the 1934/35 school year, the society maintained 76 reading rooms which registered 244,805 visitors. The officials disapproved the reading rooms and frequently fined them for various minor infractions.[5]

Ludwik Bociański, appointed voivode of Wilno in December 1935, took particularly strict measures against Rytas.[5] Police raided reading rooms, confiscated the books, and closed them due to ""threat to public order and security"". In twelve instances, curators of the reading rooms were exiled.[5] In November 1936, police raided Rytas headquarters and confiscated some of its funds. The measures had its effects: in March 1936, Rytas had four schools and 77 reading rooms; a year later, it had only two schools with 77 students and 14 reading rooms.[5] Rytas activities in the Białystok Voivodeship were prohibited citing concerns over border security. No new initiatives received official approvals and the society was effectively forced to cease its activities.[5]

Sensing that its could be abolished, in 1937–1938, Rytas transferred its archives and movable property to the Lithuanian Scientific Society, which was headquartered in the same Vileišis Palace.[15] The move did not help as both Rytas and the Scientific Society, as well as seven other Lithuanian organizations, were suspended by the starosta of Vilnius in January 1938. Rytas appealed the decision to voivode Bociański, but received a negative response on 25 February and was officially closed on 28 February.[15] Rytas' property was taken over by attorney Stefan Wilanowski and the last school in Dainava was closed.[5]

After the Polish ultimatum of March 1938, diplomatic relations were established between Poland and Lithuania and Rytas was allowed to operate again on 20 May 1939. In June, it received its property back – Vileišis Palace, now subject to a 60,000 złoty mortgage to the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, 33,303 złoty receivables, and 7,745 złoty payables.[15]

Rytas was told that no schools would be approved if they were less than 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) from a public Polish school and instead concentrated on reestablishing local chapters and reading rooms. From June to August, Rytas established 103 chapters with about 1,500 members.[15] Further activities were interrupted by World War II. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Vilnius Region was occupied by the Soviet Union and then partially transferred to Lithuania in October according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Due to wartime disruptions and regime changes, the society was not active. It registered with the Lithuanian government in February 1940 and called a general meeting in March searching for a new mission – a lot of its functions were taken over by the Lithuanian government and it could no longer rely on funding from the government or the public.[15] Rytas, along with other Lithuanian organizations, was abolished by the new Soviet regime following the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940. The last board meeting of Rytas took place on 6 July 1940.[15]

Rytas Society was reestablished in April 2004 with the help of the Vilnija society.[16] Lithuanian activists felt that areas of southeastern Lithuania where Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania won majorities in the municipal elections neglected the education in the Lithuanian language and decided to reestablished Rytas to counter this bias.[16] Algimantas Masaitis, long-time director of a Lithuanian school in Marijampolis, Vilnius District Municipality, became its chairman.[3] The society organizes lectures, events, conferences, excursions, confers awards to distinguished teachers, provides students with school supplies, books, etc.[16]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Education_Society_Rytas
Jaunutis,"Jaunutis (Polish: Jawnuta; Belarusian: Яўнут; lit. 'young man'; Christian name: Ioann; also John or Ivan; c. 1300 – after 1366) was Grand Duke of Lithuania after his father Gediminas died in 1341 until he was deposed by his elder brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis in 1345.[1]

According to Polish historian Jan Tęgowski, he was probably born between 1306 and 1309.[2]

Jaunutis was not mentioned in any written sources prior to Gediminas' death.[3] Before Gediminas' death, all his sons had been granted a domain of Lithuania. Only the second-youngest son, Jaunutis, had not received any domains but lived with his parents in Vilnius. When his father died, he automatically became the ruler of Vilnius and the nearby lands. In Gediminas' time, it was already customary to regard the Duke of Vilnius as the ruler of the whole Grand Duchy of Lithuania.[4] There are many theories why Gediminas chose Jaunutis, a middle son, as his successor. Some suggested that he was an acceptable compromise between pagan (Algirdas and Kęstutis) and Orthodox (Narimantas, Karijotas, Liubartas) sons of Gediminas.[5] Others claimed that Jaunutis was the eldest son of Gediminas' second wife; thus the tradition that Gediminas was married twice: to a pagan and to an Orthodox duchess.[6]

Very little is known about the years when Jaunutis ruled. Those were quite peaceful years, as the Teutonic Knights were led by the ineffective Ludolf König.[3] His brothers were much more active: Algirdas attacked Mozhaysk, Livonian Order, defended Pskov, Kęstutis was helping Liubartas in succession disputes in Galicia–Volhynia.[5]

Seeing that Jaunutis hesitates to provide help with their military campaigns, his two elder brothers, Algirdas and Kęstutis, agreed to remove Jaunutis and take power into their own hands. Kęstutis, who ruled the nearby Duchy of Trakai, unexpectedly captured Vilnius, he summoned Algirdas and let him rule the whole Duchy of Vilnius. As compensation, the brothers gave Jaunutis the Duchy of Zasłaŭje, but Jaunutis did not want to yield and refused the duchy.[4]

The Bychowiec Chronicle mentions that Jaunutis was supported by Jaunė, the presumed wife of Gediminas and mother of his children. She died c. 1344 soon after Jaunutis lost his throne. If he was indeed protected by his mother, then it would be an interesting example of influence held by queen mother in pagan Lithuania.[3] However, a concrete stimulus might have been a major reise planned by the Teutonic Knights in 1345.[5]

Jaunutis was supported by his brother Narimantas, who traveled to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, to form an alliance against Algirdas and Kęstutis. Jaunutis was imprisoned in Vilnius, but managed to escape and went to his Russian brother-in-law Simeon of Moscow. There Jaunutis was baptized as Ioann, but failed to solicit help (possibly because his sister Aigusta, wife of Simeon, died the same year).[7] Both Jaunutis and Narimantas had to reconcile with Algirdas. Jaunutis became the Duke of Zasłaŭje.[6] The other brothers willingly recognised Vilnius for Algirdas. [4]

He is presumed to have died c. 1366 because he is mentioned for the last time in a treaty with Poland in 1366, and not mentioned in a treaty with Livonia in 1367.[6] He had three sons, Symeon Zaslawski, Grzegorz Słucki and Michal Zaslawski.[8] Michal ruled Zasłaŭje until his death on August 12, 1399 in the Battle of the Vorskla River.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaunutis

Kristina Sabaliauskaitė,"Kristina Sabaliauskaitė is a Lithuanian author and art historian.[1] She is best known as the author of the series of historical novels Silva Rerum and Peter's Empress.

Sabaliauskaitė is considered to be one of the most prominent contemporary Lithuanian writers.[2] Born in Vilnius, she has been a longtime resident of London where she worked as a foreign correspondent and columnist for Lithuania's biggest daily newspaper Lietuvos rytas from 2002 until 2010.

Sabaliauskaitė was born in Vilnius in 1974. From 1981 to 1992, she pursued her secondary education at the Vilnius secondary school No.23. In 1998, she graduated from the Vilnius Academy of Arts with a major in art history. In 2000, she obtained a Master's degree from the Vilnius Academy of Arts, and in 2005, she completed her Ph.D. She pursued postgraduate studies at the Warburg Institute of University of London, and at the Institute of Art History of Warsaw University. She also holds a doctor honoris causa of Vilnius Academy of Arts.

In 2008, she debuted with a historical novel Silva Rerum (published by Baltos lankos) about the life of a Lithuanian noble Norvaiša family in 1659–1667, the period after The Deluge. It became a bestseller of 22 editions and was pronounced 'a literary event' and 'a cultural phenomenon' in Lithuania. It was critically acclaimed and recognised by culture historians, praised for the captivating, multilayered storytelling and the great attention to historical detail. Intended from the beginning as a tetralogy, the subsequent parts of this noble family saga (each of them describing one Norvaiša family generation) were published - 'Silva Rerum II' (2011, 16 editions, about the Great Plague of 1707-1710 and the Great Northern War), 'Silva Rerum III (2014, 11 editions, set in the mid-18th century and exploring the origins of the legend of the Righteous Proselyte of Vilna, Abraham ben Abraham and the Great Fires of 1748–1749) and 'Silva Rerum IV' (2016, 8 editions, the final part of the tetralogy about the Enlightenment and the period from 1770 to Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth partitions in 1795). All of these novels became award-winning long-term number-one bestsellers and were received with much anticipation from readers and critics, with the first print runs completely selling out in a few days (the first print run of 'Silva Rerum IV' was sold out in 3 days). 'Silva Rerum' novels have been listed many times in the critics' 'Best books lists' (2008  by the Institute of Lithuanian Literature among the twelve most creative books,[3] 2010 among the Critic's Choice 10 most memorable Lithuanian books of the past decade,[4] 2015 Lithuanian PEN Club List of 10 most important books of the decade).

Despite the complexity of the text, the popularity of the 'Silva Rerum' historical saga (called by critics 'a rare case of bestsellerdom meets quality literature') in Lithuania was such that due to reader's demand in 2011 the Vilnius Tourism Information Centre introduced literary guided tours of Vilnius Old Town[5] following the places described in Sabaliauskaitė's 'Silva rerum' trilogy.

In 2019 Baltos Lankos published the first part of the dilogy 'Peter's Empress', a novel about the Lithuanian born wife of Peter I, Martha Helena Skowrońska, the Empress of Russia Catherine I. Set in the last 24 hours of the Empress' life it tells the story of her marriage as well as of the cultural clash between the East and the West in the light of Peter I reforms. It became a number one bestseller even before hitting the bookstore shelves, with the first print-run selling out via pre-order. The novel had 7 editions in the first 6 months becoming a record breaking bestseller in Lithuania.[6] The second and final part of Peter's Empress was published in February 2021, with more than 70,000 copies sold in the first month after the release. Overall, more than 200,000 copies were sold in a country of 2,8 million.

'Peter's Empress' was met with rave reviews in all European countries where it was published and became a bestseller with multiple reprints. In France, the novel was described as the one ""of powerful charm that can be read not just a historical saga, but also like a journey through the vanished phantom landscapes. A narrative of great suspense, always balancing on the edge of utter ruin"" (Le Monde[7]), ""an immense epopee following the routes of the empire which aims to expand its borders and traditions [...] With a meticulous research of a historian and the quill that is both poetic and raw at the same time,  Sabaliauskaitė draws the prodigious fate not just of a woman, but also of the whole nation torn between its attraction to the Western modernity and the weight of its ancestral culture.“ (Le Figaro Magazine[8]), ""a novel of an epic scale, rough and poetic at the same time"" (Le Figaro Magazine[9]), with critic Gerard Collard proclaiming it to be ""not a novel, but a storm"" ('C‘est n‘est pas un roman, c‘est un ouragan'), ""an event"".[10] The Dutch edition was equally successful, with critics comparing Sabaliauskaite's storytelling power with that of Umberto Eco or Hillary Mantel (Knack Focus, Belgium[11]), Marguerite Yourcenar,[12] naming 'Peter's Empress' as the 'dazzling historical novel' among the best books of 2022 (NRC, The Netherlands[13]). In Estonia 'Peter's Empress' (Part 2) became The Book of the Year 2022, receiving also glowing reviews from leading petrologist historians for its historical accuracy, calling it 'the perfect historical novel, a symbiosis of historical accuracy, a psychological and emotionally engaging biography, the true flavour and aroma of literature'.[14]

In 2012 Baltos Lankos published a selection of short stories 'Danielius Dalba & kitos istorijos' (Danielius Dalba & Other Stories) which became a number one bestseller. 8 short stories in voices of different social dialects and characters tell more recent Lithuanian history - from World War II to contemporary times, encapsulating the Polish, Jewish and Soviet Vilnius, life in emigration, the living memories of the historical traumas of the past.

In 2015 'Vilnius Wilno Vilna: Three Short Stories', taken from the collection 'Danielius Dalba & kitos istorijos' and translated into English by Romas Kinka, illustrated with photography of Jan Bułhak and Romualdas Rakauskas, was published by Baltos Lankos and also went on to become a bestseller.

The Latvian translation of 'Silva Rerum' was published in 2010 to rave reviews, comparing it to the work on the level of Salman Rushdie and Umberto Eco. In 2014 the translations by Dace Meiere of 'Silva Rerum' and Silva Rerum II (published in Latvia by Zvaigzne ABC) were voted by Latvian readers for inclusion in a list of 100 of Latvia's Most Favourite Books of All Times (the only book by a Lithuanian author in the list). Peter's Empress (Pētera Imperatore, Part I, 2020) has become the first Lithuanian book to reach number one on the bestselling lists.

In 2015 the Polish translation of 'Silva Rerum' by Izabela Korybut-Daszkiewicz was published in Poland and received exceptional reviews, with Olga Tokarczuk describing it as 'a splendidly written, marquesian novel which takes place in seventeenth century Lithuania and eventually reminds us that the history of Central Europe is our shared narrative' and critics calling it 'a novel which restores faith in literature', 'a true literary sensation from Lithuania (Mariusz Cieślik, Wprost[15]), 'a truly monumental text, literature of the highest standard, a universal novel about humanity' (Tomasz Orwid, Dobre Książki[16]). It was the first Lithuanian novel to receive such visibility and critical acclaim in Poland and to be shortlisted for the prestigious ANGELUS Central European Literary Prize in 2016 among 7 finalists.

The second part 'Silva Rerum II' (translated by Izabela Korybut-Daszkiewicz) was published in 2018 to even bigger critical acclaim and with the introduction blurb of Olga Tokarczuk stating that 'Kristina Sabaliauskaitė belongs among the most powerful and expressive voices of the historical novel in Europe'. The critics noted that the sequel is even more impressive than the debut novel, noting that 'here we encounter the literature which transgresses the conventional boundaries and speaks about the essential, fundamental cultural experiences',[17] 'Sabaliauskaite has created a refined historical novel in a form that encapsulates the epoch. But first and foremost it is the exquisitely told, realistic and captivating human stories',[18] emphasizing even greater mastery of the storytelling and the use of language: 'A breathtaking historical novel. [...] A spiritual feast for the reader. Nowadays a rare author uses such colourful, artistic and noble language'.[19]

In 2022–2023 Kristina Sabaliauskaitė collaborated with internationally acclaimed Lithuanian composer and conductor Gediminas Gelgotas creating the lyrics for his symphony ""The Sarabande Of Vilnius"" which premiered on 10 March 2023 in Vilnius at Lithuanian National Philharmonic. ""The Sarabande of Vilnius"", commissioned to commemorate the 700th anniversary of Vilnius'mention in historical sources, was conducted by Gelgotas and performed by Lithuanian National Symphony Orchestra and the choir Jauna Muzika.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristina_Sabaliauskaitė

Lithuania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024,"Lithuania was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with the song ""Luktelk"", written by Silvestras Beltė, Džesika Šyvokaitė, and Elena Jurgaitytė, and performed by Beltė himself under his stage name Silvester Belt. The Lithuanian participating broadcaster, Lithuanian National Radio and Television (LRT), organised the national final Eurovizija.LT 2024 in order to select its entry at the contest.

Lithuania was drawn to compete in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest which took place on 7 May 2024 and was later selected to perform in position 3. At the end of the show, ""Luktelk"" was announced among the top 10 entries of the first semi-final and hence qualified to compete in the final. It was later revealed that Lithuania placed fourth out of the fifteen participating countries in the semi-final with 119 points. In the final, Lithuania performed in position 7 and placed fourteenth out of the 25 performing countries, scoring a total of 90 points.

Prior to 2024, Lithuanian National Radio and Television (LRT) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing Lithuania twenty-three times since its first entry in 1994. Its best placing was achieved in 2006, with ""We Are the Winners"", performed by LT United, finishing in sixth place in the final. Following the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, LRT had managed to qualify to the final twelve times. It was represented in 2023 by the song ""Stay"", performed by Monika Linkytė, who qualified for the final and ended 11th overall with 127 points.[1]

As part of its duties as participating broadcaster, LRT organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. Between 2020 and 2023, the national final format Pabandom iš naujo! was used to select its entry. LRT confirmed its intention to participate in the 2024 contest in mid-July 2023;[2] three months later, the broadcaster announced that it would use a new format, titled Eurovizija.LT.[3]

Eurovizija.LT 2024 was the national final format organised by LRT to select its entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024. It was held between 13 January and 17 February 2024 and was hosted by Gabrielė Martirosian and Nombeko Augustė Khotseng, with TikToker Nerijus Trilikauskas hosting segments from the green room.[4][5] The shows were broadcast on LRT televizija and LRT Lituanica as well as online via the broadcaster's website lrt.lt and official LRT YouTube channel, while the final was also broadcast on LRT radijas and official Eurovision Song Contest YouTube channel.

The competition saw 40 entries compete across five semi-finals, held between 13 January and 10 February 2024, and a final on 17 February 2024.[6][7] A 50/50 combination of jury and public vote determined the ranking in each phase, with the top two entries from each semi-final (out of the eight total) qualifying for the final; the top three entries from the final moved on to a final televoting round selecting the winner. In case of a tie in any of the previous stages, the jury ranking would take precedence.[3][8][9] The score system is the same used at the Eurovision Song Contest: the top ten entries from each of the jury vote and the televote are assigned 1–8, 10 and 12 points.[8]

Performances for the semi-finals were pre-recorded, while they were delivered live in the final.[3][8]

On 18 October 2023, LRT opened a submission platform for interested artists, lasting until 11 December 2023. Each applicant could only submit one entry. Performers were required to be Lithuanian citizens, while songwriters could be of any nationality.[3][8] At the end of the submission period, over sixty applications had been received.[7] The selected artists were privately informed of their selection by 18 December 2023 and were able to withdraw until 31 December 2023.[8]

On 19 December 2023, the list of the 40 participating artists and songs was released by LRT. Among the selected competing artists were Andrius Pojavis, Vilija and The Roop, who represented Lithuania in the 2013, 2014 and 2021 contests, respectively.[7][9] In January, Kotryna Juodzevičiūtė [lt] withdrew from the competition and was replaced by Marius Petrauskas.[10]

The five semi-finals of the competition were filmed on 9, 16, 17, 23 and 24 January 2024 at the LRT studios in Vilnius, and were aired on 13, 20, 27 January, 3 and 10 February 2024.[7] In each semi-final, 8 of the 40 competing acts performed, with the top two entries progressing to the final.

Each semi-final opened with a performance of dancers staged by choreographer Marijanas Staniulėnas.[17] In addition to the performances of the competing entries, interval acts performed:

The live final of the competition took place on 17 February 2024 at the Švyturys Arena in Klaipėda.[23] The final was opened by a performance of dancers staged by choreographer Marijanas Staniulėnas, followed by a parade of participants presenting all ten finalists. In addition to the performances of the competing entries Mango performed ""Penkios Minutės"", ""Sugrįžk, Prašau"", ""Paviršius Širdies"", ""Pavasariniai Žiedai"" and ""Alyvos"", Dons performed 2024 Latvian Eurovision entry ""Hollow"" and Monika Linkytė performed 2023 Lithuanian Eurovision entry ""Stay"" as the interval acts. A combination of the votes of a jury (50%) and the public (50%) selected three songs for a superfinal, where a televoting round determined the winner.[16]

Due to a technical error during the superfinal, most votes had not been counted at the time of reveal of the results. During the broadcast, it was stated that ""Luktelk"" received 16,688 votes, that ""Impossible"" received 9,066, and that ""Simple Joy"" received 6,884 votes. Two days later, it was revealed that ""Luktelk"" had received 34,691, ""Impossible"" had received 20,307, and ""Simple Joy"" had received 15,046 votes. Upon counting all the votes, the results of the superfinal remained the same.[24]

As part of the promotion of his participation in the contest, Silvester Belt attended the Melfest WKND event in Stockholm on 8 March 2024, the PrePartyES in Madrid on 30 March 2024, the Barcelona Eurovision Party on 6 April 2024, the London Eurovision Party on 7 April 2024, the Eurovision in Concert event in Amsterdam on 13 April 2024 and the Copenhagen Eurovision Party (Malmöhagen) on 4 May 2024.[27][28] In this period, he met with Lithuanian communities in Stockholm, Amsterdam, London, Copenhagen and Malmö.[29][30] In addition, he performed at the Eurovision Village in Malmö on 9 May 2024.[31]

On 16 April 2024, LRT launched the social media campaign Mums reikia šokt! (""We need to dance!""), during which Lithuanian residents were invited to film themselves dancing to the song ""Luktelk"" and upload it to social networks. The selected material was used by LRT during the Eurovision week.[32][33]

The Eurovision Song Contest 2024 took place at the Malmö Arena in Malmö, Sweden, and consisted of two semi-finals held on the respective dates of 7 and 9 May and the final on 11 May 2024. All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the ""Big Five"" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete in the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progressed to the final. On 30 January 2024, an allocation draw was held to determine which of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show, each country would perform in; the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot.[34] Lithuania was scheduled for the first half of the first semi-final.[35] The shows' producers then decided the running order for the semi-finals; Lithuania was set to perform in position 3.[36]

In Lithuania, all the shows were broadcast on LRT televizija and on LRT radijas as well as online via the broadcaster's website lrt.lt, with commentary provided by Ramūnas Zilnys [lt].[29] Each semi-final was preceded by a half-hour preview show hosted by Zilnys,[37] and before the final, there was also a special 25-minute documentary by Rolandas Masiulis about Silvester Belt's road to Eurovision.[38] In addition, as part of the Eurovision programming, LRT aired a documentary titled ABBA – Against the Odds, produced by DR, SVT and several other EBU members on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Sweden's first victory at the contest with ""Waterloo"" by ABBA.[39][40][41] During the Eurovision week, a special radio show was broadcast, hosted by former Eurovision commentators Darius Užkuraitis [lt] and Gerūta Griniūtė.[42] In March and April, LRT radijas also presented the podcast Suvienyti Eurovizijos (""United by Eurovision""), hosted by Justas Buivydas.[43] Also, since March 29, during the LRT televizija morning show Labas rytas, Lietuva (""Good morning, Lithuania""), one song of this year's contest was presented every day.[44]

Silvester Belt took part in technical rehearsals on 27 April and 1 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 6 and 7 May.[45] The staging of his performance of ""Luktelk"" at the contest is directed by Povilas Varvuolis, who had been responsible for all Lithuanian performances since 2017, and Norvydas Genys, who is responsible for the content of the LED screens and lighting.[27] He is joined by four dancers: Arnas Ginevičius, Nerijus Trilikauskas, Eivydas Katkauskas and Andrius Vrubliauskas; while Monika Švilpaitė serves as an off-stage backing vocalist.[46][47] His clothing was designed by Vainotas Jakštas and created by Marija Petraitytė (costume), Kamilė Peleckytė (shoes) and Gintarė Pečkytė (accessories).[48]

Lithuania performed in position 3, following the entry from Serbia and before the entry from Ireland.[36] At the end of the show, the country was announced as a qualifier for the final. It was later revealed that Lithuania placed fourth out of the fifteen participating countries in the first semi-final with 119 points.

Following the semi-final, Lithuania was drawn to perform in the first half of the final.[49] Lithuania will perform in position 7, following the entry from Israel and before the entry from Spain.[50] Silvester Belt once again took part in dress rehearsals on 10 and 11 May before the final, including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show on 11 May. He performed a repeat of his semi-final performance during the final on 11 May. Lithuania placed fourteenth in the final, scoring 90 points; 58 points from the public televoting and 32 points from the juries.

Below is a breakdown of points awarded by and to Lithuania in the first semi-final and in the final. Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting in the final vote, while the semi-final vote was based entirely on the vote of the public.[51] The Lithuanian jury consisted of Agneta Gabalytė, Jievaras Jasinskis, who represented Lithuania in the 2010 contest as member of the group InCulto, Povilas Meškėla, Kristupas Naraškevičius, and Monika Marija Paulauskaitė.[52] In the first semi-final, Lithuania placed 4th with 119 points, receiving maximum twelve points from Ireland and the United Kingdom, and marking a fourth consecutive qualification to the final for the country. In the final, Lithuania placed 14th with 90 points. Over the course of the contest, Lithuania awarded its 12 points to Ukraine in the first semi-final, and Switzerland (jury) and Ukraine (televote) in the final.[53][54]

LRT appointed Monika Linkytė, who represented Lithuania in the 2015 and 2023 contests, as its spokesperson to announce the Lithuanian jury's votes in the final.[55]

Each participating broadcaster assembles a five-member jury panel consisting of music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent. Each jury, and individual jury member, is required to meet a strict set of criteria regarding professional background, as well as diversity in gender and age. No member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently.[56] The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.

The following members comprised the Lithuanian jury:[52]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania_in_the_Eurovision_Song_Contest_2024
Samogitians,"Samogitians (Samogitian: žemaitē, Lithuanian: žemaičiai, Latvian: žemaiši) are the inhabitants of Samogitia, an ethnographic region of Lithuania. Many speak the Samogitian language, which in Lithuania is mostly considered a dialect of the Lithuanian language together with the Aukštaitian dialect.[1] The Samogitian language differs the most from the standard Lithuanian language.[1]

Whether Samogitians are considered to be a distinct ethnic group or merely a subset of Lithuanians varies. However, 2,169 people declared their ethnicity as Samogitian during the Lithuanian census of 2011, of whom 53.9% live in Telšiai County.[2] The political recognition and cultural understanding of the Samogitian ethnicity has, however, changed drastically throughout the last few centuries as 448,022 people declared themselves Samogitians, not Lithuanians, in the 1897 Russian Empire census.[3]

On 13 July 1260, the Samogitians decisively defeated the joint forces of the Teutonic Knights from Prussia and Livonian Order from Livonia in the Battle of Durbe. Some 150 knights were killed, including Livonian Master Burchard von Hornhausen and Prussian Land Marshal Henrik Botel.[4]

Samogitians lived in western Lithuania and were closely related to Semigallians and Curonians. In 1413, they became the last group of Europeans to convert to Christianity. Samogitians lived in the Duchy of Samogitia within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1857, there were 418,824 people of Samogitian roots and 444,921 persons declared the Samogitian language as their mother tongue in 1897 in Kovno Governorate.[5] Currently Lithuania does not allow for declaration of Samogitian nationality in passports as it is not a recognized ethnicity.[6] In list of ethnic groups of Russia there is one person who declared himself with ""Zhemaijty"".[7]

Samogitians call themselves žemaitē, although exonyms are used in different languages.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samogitians

Liberal Union of Lithuania,"The Liberal Union of Lithuania (Lithuanian: Lietuvos liberalų sąjunga (LLS)) was a liberal[4] political party in Lithuania.[5][6]

The party was founded on the 25th of November, 1990 on a basis of the Vilnius University Liberal Club. Its first leader was Vilnius University philosophy professor Vytautas Radžvilas. In the 1992 parliamentary election, the Liberal Union got 1.51 percent of votes and failed to win any seats. In January 1993 the party congress agreed upon declaration, which stated that the party would position itself on the right. In 1994 the party's membership grew. Most of these new members were either former politicians (e. g. former Moderates Movement's leader Eugenijus Gentvilas) or employees of the infamous East-Baltic States-West [lt] investment company.

In the 1995 municipal election, the party got 2.69 percent of the votes nationally and 40 councillors. Most of these gains were city districts (e. g. Birštonas, Marijampolė, Klaipėda).[7] After these elections many members of Liberal Union in Kaunas resigned. In 1996 parliamentary election the party received 1.84 percent of the votes and one mandate. In 1997 municipal election, the party won 3.99 percent of the votes. As a result, the Liberal Union managed to form coalitions with other parties and win mayorships (most notably, in Klaipėda).

Party's breakthrough came in late 1999, when former Prime Minister of Lithuania (and Homeland Union member) Rolandas Paksas became party's leader. In 2000 municipal election the Liberal Union won 13.99 percent of the votes (first place was won by the New Union (Social Liberals) with 16.68 percent of the votes) and mayorships in three major cities, Vilnius, Kaunas and Klaipėda. In the parliamentary election of the same year, the party won 17.25 percent of the votes and 34 seats in Seimas. By this, the Liberal Union was the largest single party in Seimas for four months in 2000 and 2001.

After these elections, the Liberal Union formed a coalition with the New Union (Social Liberals), the Lithuanian Centre Union, the Modern Christian Democrats and the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (with support from the Lithuanian Peasants Party). This coalition lasted for seven months, when New Union (Social Liberals) withdraw their government ministers.

After this, the party joined the opposition. By December 2001, Rolandas Paksas (and some of his followers) left the Liberal Union and founded the Liberal Democratic Party. Along this split, the party started negotiations with former coalition partners, the Lithuanian Centre Union and the Modern Christian Democrats, about merger. All three parties merged into Liberal and Centre Union in 2003.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Union_of_Lithuania

Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth,"The Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth was a proposed state that would have been based on a personal union between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia. A number of serious attempts by various means to create such a union took place between 1574 and 1658 and in the late 18th century, but it never materialized because of the incompatible demands from both sides.

The proposed union is known in Polish as the Triple Union (unia troista) and has also been called the Polish–Russian Union (unia polsko-rosyjska) or the Polish–Muscovite Union (unia polsko-moskiewska).

Proponents of such a union among the Polish szlachta and Lithuanian nobility, including the influential secular thinkers Jan Zamoyski and Lew Sapieha, had listed several arguments in its favour: peace on the turbulent eastern border, a powerful military ally and relatively sparsely-populated territories (compared to the Commonwealth) for colonisation and serfdom. The idea was also supported by the Jesuits and other papal emissaries, who never ceased to entertain the idea of bringing Eastern Orthodox Russia into the Catholic fold.[citation needed] Some of the Russian Boyars found the proposal attractive (like Boris Godunov, a supporter of Czar Feodor I's candidacy) for various reasons, such as the fact that the Golden Freedoms of the Commonwealth, if applied in Russia, would weaken Czar's power and thus grant them a much higher status than enjoyed previously.[citation needed]

The proposals then revolved around introducing a personal union between the Commonwealth and Russia and various economic and political agreements (elimination of trade barriers, free movement of people etc.) up to the creation of one country by using the framework of that led to the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the first place (Union of Lublin of 1569). However, all proposals presented by the Polish-Lithuanian side were rejected by the Russian Czar. The most promising negotiations took place during 1600, when a Polish-Lithuanian diplomatic mission, led by Lew Sapieha, arrived in Moscow. Sapieha presented to Boris Godunov an elaborated idea of a union between Poland–Lithuania and Russia. The subjects of both rulers were to be free to serve the other ruler, travel to the other country, contract marriages with the other ruler's subjects, own land and go study in the other country.[1]

Although Moscow was willing to agree to some parts of the proposed treaties (like extradition of crime suspects), it strictly opposed points on religious tolerance (non-Orthodox religions, especially Catholicism, were persecuted in Russia, unlike in Commonwealth, which allowed all faiths to be preached) and free movement of people (according to Polish scholars).[2] To transform the Russian Czardom into a republic modelled on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth would have proven to be a too ambitious project. Many Russians were afraid of Polonization, which was already occurring with the Lithuanian and the Ruthenian nobility, and a growing danger stemming from the increasing number of peasant and even noble refugees escaping the Russian Empire,[3][4] to which Russian Czar Ivan responded with the policy of violent repressions, the so-called oprichnina. The Union of Brest of 1596 was a further argument for the Orthodox opponents of the closer ties between Russia and the Commonwealth, who argued that it was the prelude to the Catholicisation of Russia.

The idea was first broached in the 16th century, after the death of the last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania of the Jagiellon dynasty, Sigismund II Augustus. Czar Ivan IV of Russia (""the Terrible"") became a popular candidate among the Polish nobility. He had substantial support in Poland, especially among the lesser and the middle nobility, which saw in him an opportunity to limit the growing power of the Polish-Lithuanian magnates. During the interregnum, two diplomatic missions (led by Great Scribe of Lithuania Michał Harraburda and Jędrzej Taranowski) were sent to Moscow to hold discussions. The negotiations failed because of hostilities resulting from the Livonian War, territorial demands by Ivan (who wanted former territories of Kievan Rus', which was under the control of Lithuania) and the decision by Ivan that the Russian side would not ""lower itself to the level of other European monarchies and send a diplomatic mission to Poland begging for him to become a king"". During the second interregnum, in 1574, the candidature of Ivan IV was even highly regarded in Poland, but the Moscow diplomatic mission that arrived in Poland had no orders or prerogatives to negotiate that matter. Eventually, the disappointed pro-Ivan faction, represented by Jan Sierakowski, issued a statement in the Sejm: ""The Great Prince of Muscovy would be the best choice for king, but because of his silence we are forced to forget him and should not mention him again"".[2]

The mixed circle of proponents of the idea saw an opportunity in Russia after the death of Ivan the Terrible, the last Russian ruler of the time whose legitimacy was never questioned. The proposal was revived soon after Ivan's death through the reigns of Stefan Batory in the Commonwealth and Feodor I in Russia. After Batory's death in 1587, Feodor I became interested in acquiring the Polish-Lithuanian throne and sent a diplomatic mission to Poland. His support among the Lithuanians was high, but Poles issued several demands, such as requiring Fedors's conversion to Catholicism, an entirely unthinkable event. Eventually, Sigismund III Vasa was elected the king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania. The death of Feodor prompted Sigismund to propose his candidacy for the Moscow throne, but by the time the diplomatic mission arrived in Moscow, Boris Godunov had been elected as the new Czar.[2]

With the legitimacy issues clouding the entire period of the rule of Boris Godunov, Russia submerged into even greater chaos upon his death, the Russian Time of Troubles, which was accompanied by a decisive Polish-Lithuanian armed intervention, the Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618). In the course of the Polish–Muscovite War, the Polish-Lithuanian prince (later king), Władysław IV Vasa, was briefly elected a Russian Czar among other such strange developments like the enthronement and the brief reign of False Dmitriy I, an impostor of Czar Ivan's son. However, Wladyslaw was never officially enthroned, and his quick election remained in history as one of the fluke events of the Time of Troubles.

The idea was again proposed in 1656 to 1658, when Moscow suggested that one of the points of negotiations would be the election of the Russian Czar for the Polish-Lithuanian throne. This time, it was the Polish side that presented demands (conversion to Catholicism and territorial changes) that eventually discouraged Russians from pursuing the project. In 1658, the Sejm elected Tsar Alexis I as King, but the decision was annulled by the protest of the Catholic church.[5]

Finally, the idea returned in the 18th century, when the last Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke, Stanisław August Poniatowski, attempted to save the Commonwealth by proposing a marriage between himself and Russian Empress Catherine the Great.

The very possibility that such an idea could have been seriously considered by the Polish side early on was likely based on the spirit of the 1573 Warsaw Confederation (Warsaw Compact), which guaranteed, at least formally, equality for non-Catholic nobles in the Commonwealth. However, the adopted convention was an unprecedentedly liberal act for its time, such full equality was never achieved in reality even within the Commonwealth itself. Taking into account that most divisions of the time, if not dynastic ones, were religious and the relationship between the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox branches of Christianities were strained at best, it remains surprising that such an idea was seriously considered at all. It remains equally unlikely that such an idea could have been accepted by the Russian side because the view towards Catholicism in the Russian Empire was highly negative.

Thus, while the idea of a Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth was supported early on by some progressive and secular Polish diplomats, the efforts of the few could not in the end overcome Russian opposition to Catholicism and the fear that such a union would spell Catholic domination over Orthodoxy.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite_Commonwealth
Lithuanian Council of Lords,"The Lithuanian Council of Lords (Lithuanian: Ponų taryba) was the main permanent institution of central government in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania active in its capital city of Vilnius.[1]

It had originated from the advisory Council of the Grand Duke, established by Vytautas the Great in the early 15th century. During the reign of Casimir Jagiellon it was renamed to the Council of Lords. Under the Union of Lublin of 1569, the Council formally became a constituent part of the Polish–Lithuanian Senates (see also Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), together with the Royal Council of Poland, but it continued to operate de facto until the mid-17th century.[2][3]

The Council carried out the functions of the Grand Duke after his death and had a supreme authority in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until a new Grand Duke was appointed, as well as organised his appointment. The first appointed ruler was Casimir Jagiellon, who in exchange expanded the council's powers significantly and approved the Casimir Code. The council was granted judicial powers and became an appellate instance, subordinate to the King and acting in the absence of him, who remained the chief justice. Casimir was followed by his son Alexander who issued another privilege in 1492. According to the privilege of 1506 by his brother Sigismund the Old, the new laws could no longer be adopted and the existing could not be amended without the council's consent. The First Lithuanian Statute of 1529 confirmed its administrative powers, as well as granted legislative powers, exercised together with the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The council's legislative powers were limited under the subsequent edition of the Lithuanian Statute of 1566, as a result of a growing role of szlachta and its Sejms.

The Council carried out executive functions in the state since 1445 because the majority of Lithuanian Grand Dukes resided in Poland. It also convoked the Lithuanian Seimas.

The council had 35 – 50 permanent members as of 1529. It consisted of the most prominent representatives of the Lithuanian magnate families, as well as bishops, marshals and treasurers. The ex officio members of the council were the voivodes of Vilnius and Trakai, castellans of Vilnius and Trakai, the Elder of Samogitia, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania and the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania. Since the 16th century, these members comprised a Secret Council which was a de facto core of the Council of Lords, dealing with all crucial state affairs, since the full membership of the council was rarely convened. A majority of the members were Roman Catholic ethnic Lithuanians;[4] however, the influence of Ruthenian magnates was constantly increasing.

The highest ranked statesmen in the Lithuanian Council of Lords were voivodes of Vilnius and Trakai, while the Elders of Samogitia (self-elected by the Samogitian nobility and confirmed by the Grand Duke of Lithuania) were the third most important.[5]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_Council_of_Lords

Constituent Assembly of Lithuania,"The Constituent Assembly of Lithuania or Constituent Seimas (Lithuanian: Steigiamasis Seimas) was the first parliament of the independent state of Lithuania to be elected in a direct, democratic, general, secret election. The Assembly assumed its duties on 15 May 1920 and was disbanded in October 1922.

Following the last Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by and became part of the Russian Empire.

On 21 September 1917, Vilnius played host to the Lithuanian Conference which resolved that, to lay the groundwork for the independent Lithuania and regulate its relations with the neighbours, a Constituent Assembly, elected under the principles of democracy by all of its residents, had to be convened in Vilnius.[1] The resolutions of the Conference were to be implemented by an executive body: the Lithuanian Council of 20 members (to become the Council of the State of Lithuania as of 11 July 1918). It was this Council that adopted the Act of Independence on 16 February 1918, stipulating that a Constituent Assembly was to be convened as soon as possible. On 2 November 1918, the Council of the State of Lithuania passed the Fundamental Laws of the Provisional Constitution of the State of Lithuania, which said that the future form of the state of Lithuania would be determined by the Constituent Assembly. The Law on the Election of the Constituent Assembly was adopted on 30 October 1919.[2]

Lithuania was divided into 11 constituencies, of which 5 were not controlled by Lithuanians at the time.[3] The total designated number of mandates was 229, but the Polish-controlled Vilnius region and the French-controlled Klaipėda region were barred from the elections. The constituencies under Lithuania's control were able to elect 112 representatives, one per population of 15,000. Every citizen aged 21 and above was entitled to vote; the voting age threshold for the military was 17.[4] The paragraph in the Provisional Constitution stating that the Constituent Assembly would gather in Vilnius was amended. The rights and duties of the parties and fines and punishment for the obstruction of the elections, agitation by state officials during work hours, destruction of visual ads and electoral lists, the exercise of coercion or bribery towards voters, agitation out of place and time.[5] The elections took place on 14–15 April 1920. The voter turnout reached about 90%. The voters, both men and women, elected 112 representatives.

The plurality of the votes went to the lists of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, securing it 59 seats. The bloc of the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party and the Lithuanian Peasants’ Union placed second with 28 mandates. The Social Democratic Party of Lithuania won 13 seats. Ethnic parties won ten seats (six to Democratic Jewish Union, three to the Central Polish Electoral Committee and one to the Lithuanian German Committee). There were two non-partisan representatives.[6] Later on, the parliamentary structure would shift. By way of rotation, some representatives would step down to be replaced by new ones. As a result, 150 persons[7] had held a seat at the parliament by the end of the term.[8]

Most representatives were very young: 26 of them were aged 30 or under, and only two 12 members of the parliament were 50 or older. Of them, 4 were members of the Jewish faction. The majority of the members of the parliament (37 out of 150) had a college degree, with the group of self-taught representatives coming in second (26 out of 150). Seven representatives were graduates of a spiritual academy or a divinity school.[9]

The parliament had 8 female representatives. By way of seniority, MP Gabrielė Petkevičaitė–Bitė chaired the solemn inaugural meeting, with Ona Muraškaitė–Račiukaitienė, being the youngest member of the parliament, acting as secretary.[10][11] It was a major achievement for women at the time.[12]

In terms of trade, most members of the parliament were farmers (21).[13] They were followed by teachers (18), officials, co-operators, and municipal workers (18), craftsmen and workmen (17), lawyers (13), priests and rabbis (12), military officers (13).[14]

The first meeting took place on 15 May 1920 in Kaunas, the temporary capital. Aleksandras Stulginskis was elected as the chairman and de facto president. As soon as 10 June 1920, it passed the third and final draft of the constitution.

On 12 June 1920, a peace treaty was signed with the Russian SFSR. It was highly beneficial to Lithuania as Russia recognized its independence de jure (the first state to do so after 1918) and acknowledged that vast areas of the Vilnius region belonged to Lithuania. Shortly after the defeat in the Battle of Warsaw, the withdrawing Red Army handed Vilnius over to Lithuania, in accordance with the agreement.[15]

From October 1920 till February 1921, the Constituent Assembly was adjourned because the Lithuanian-Belarusian Division of the Polish Army under General Lucjan Żeligowski seized Vilnius. Many representatives went to the front to defend the historic capital. Before adjourning it had created the so-called Small Seimas (Lithuanian: Mažasis Seimas) consisting of the Chairman and six members of the regular Constituent Assembly who were authorized to pass urgent laws.

In March 1921, after international arbitration, a border treaty with Latvia was signed. 21 km of coastline including the towns of Palanga and Šventoji were transferred to Lithuania. It also defended its interest in the city of Mažeikiai. In return, Latvia received the so-called Aknysta foreland (Latvian: Aknīste) north of Rokiškis. In total, Latvia gained about 100 km² more than Lithuania. This treaty solved all border conflicts with Latvia and the border remains the same today. It became a foundation for good and healthy cooperation between the two nations.[16]

On 23 September 1921, Lithuania became a member of the League of Nations. Most of the world's countries immediately recognized its independence.

On 15 February 1922, it passed a law on land reform. It was a decade-long reform which nationalized land owned by the nobility and distributed it to the volunteers who fought in the Freedom Wars and to peasants who owned none or very little land. This way Lithuania's agriculture was based on small (20-50 ha) farms. Over the years 459,000 ha of land were distributed to over 65,000 people. The nobility was allowed to keep 80 ha of land and was reimbursed an average of 27 litas per hectare (equivalent to $2.70 USD under the exchange rate in 1922) for nationalized land. People who received land, except for the volunteers, were required to pay for the land for 36 years.

The main goal, to adopt a new constitution, was reached on 1 August 1922. The constitution granted broad powers to the Seimas, the Parliament. It selected the Cabinet of Ministers and elected the President. The Seimas and the president were to be elected every three years in democratic elections. Lithuania was declared a democratic republic modeled after the example of France. Because of the Christian democrats' majority, the constitution clearly reflected Christian ideas. For example, it established that religious education is mandatory and its preamble starts with the words ""In the name of Almighty God"" (Lithuanian: Vardan Dievo Visagalio).

On 9 September a law was passed on the national currency, introducing the litas. On 1 October, it was introduced. Litas became one of the stronger currencies in Europe.

On 16 February 1922, the Lithuanian University was established and had its statute approved on the initiative of V. Čepinskis a month later.

On 6 October 1922, the Constituent Assembly resigned. A new regular Seimas started on 13 November. The assembly passed approximately 150 laws, strengthened the state's administrative system, and laid the foundations of the future economic, social and cultural life in Lithuania.[17]

The Constituent Assembly continued to work for 29 months, held 257 plenary sessions and 963-panel sittings, and passed over 300 laws. Its main achievement was the first permanent Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania, which was adopted on 1 August 1922 to close the cycle of the prior provisional constitutions:

The Assembly cemented the principles of western democracy grounded on the freedom of faith, consciousness, speech, the equality of nations and genders before the law, and the immunity of a person. The expiry of the Constituent Assembly's term marked the end of the national rebirth in Lithuania, the restoration of the state, resulting in the building of a legal foundation for the independent state. In addition to the fundamental laws (the standing Constitution, the land reform, the introduction of the Litas, and the establishment of the university), other areas of life were regulated as well. The country switched to a metric system, Central European time, implemented executive control, and became an active player on the international stage. During the term of the Constituent Assembly, Lithuania received de jure recognition from 16 states.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_Assembly_of_Lithuania

Lietuvos paštas,"Lietuvos paštas (lit. 'Lithuanian Post') is the company responsible for postal service in Lithuania. The company was re-established on 16 November 1918, and this date celebrate as Post Lithuania day.[4]

In 2018, Lithuanian Post consisted of 546 fixed post offices, 85 mobile service locations and 120 smart postmen in 12 districts.

On 11 July 1562, the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the King of Poland Sigismund Augustus commissioned Christopher Taxis to organise a regular mail transport route Vilnius-Kraków-Vienna-Venice. At that time, letters between Kraków and Vilnius were delivered in 7 days. The importance of post increased after 1583, when the King-Grand Duke Stephen Báthory enforced standardised mail charges, thus providing universal access to mail. At that time, mail began to be delivered on a regular basis.

On 16 November 1918, the Lithuanian Ministry of Finance, Trade and Industry minister Martynas Yčas [lt]s signed a decree establishing a Lithuanian postal board. This date is considered the official founding day of Lithuanian postal history and is celebrated as National Post Day. During the Soviet occupation, the Lithuanian Post activities were taken over by the Soviet authorities.

On 7 October 1990, the mail came into circulation once again with the release of the first independent Lithuanian stamp series – ""Angel"". On 17 December 1991, Lithuania decided to reorganise the management structure of national communications, separating postal and electrical connections and forming two separate state enterprises: Lithuanian Post and Lietuvos Telekomas acting as the public telephony operator.
In 2006, the company was reorganised into a joint stock company.[5]

The group of companies of Lietuvos paštas, which has the widest network of access points to services in the country, provides not only postal services, but also services of logistics, financial intermediation, and electronic services.

All shares of AB Lietuvos paštas are controlled by the State represented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Lithuania.

The Company’s managerial body is the General Meeting of Shareholders, the Board and CEO. The Board consists of five members elected by the General Meeting of Shareholders for a term of four years.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lietuvos_paštas
